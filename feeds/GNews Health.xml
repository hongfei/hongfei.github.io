    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They theorised that the benefit may also lie with dairy's influence on healthy gut bugs, which could be explained by the high quantity of calcium within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Calcium may help protect against cancer by binding to potentially harmful substances in the gut and promoting the death of abnormal cells,' Prof Stebbing explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Cancer Research UK data, 54 percent of all bowel cancers could be prevented by living a healthier lifestyle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Stebbing's recommendations come amid a global epidemic in bowel cancers among under 50 year-olds — many of who are otherwise fit and healthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review of 50 nations found cases in the under 50s were on the rise in over half of all nations surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, the number of younger patients with the disease has jumped 50 per cent  over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England was also found to have one of the fastest rises globally with the rate of the disease growing an average of 3.6 per cent each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts aren't entirely sure why the rise exists, but they suspect poor diet, including the increased popularity of ultra-processed foods, and a lack of exercise could be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, nearly 45,000 Brits are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s what has allowed this outbreak to grow to over 300 cases so quickly. We fear the number of actual cases may be much higher than reported due to confusion and delays in the outbreak response," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A spokesperson for DSHS confirmed to ABC News that the first cases in the outbreak were among Mennonite community members, but this is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Since 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus will become ill, there are many cases in people who are not part of the Mennonite community," the spokesperson said.

From Google DeepMind, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which was &lt;a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; on a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’d &lt;em&gt;pray &lt;/em&gt;for the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solving &lt;a href="https://predictioncenter.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to the &lt;a href="https://alphafoldserver.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaFold server&lt;/a&gt; and produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to her &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00911-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt;, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8072fff0-011e-478b-9806-217adef6217e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element  element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel Prize, and revolutionised drug discovery.’&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: EMBL-EBI/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In this &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn6354" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent Science study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Through &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; testing (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Solving a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9326" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old problem&lt;/a&gt;: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; the cancer protein &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C%20CDK20" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDK20&lt;/a&gt;, prevented liver cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Helping to design a “molecular syringe”, which delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05870-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;therapeutic protein payload&lt;/a&gt; into human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are companies built on AlphaFold, too. If AlphaFold is solving the lock, then &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaProteo&lt;/a&gt; provides the key. AlphaProteo uses AlphaFold’s structures to design molecules that can bind to and modulate other proteins. This has been used to generate molecules that have never been made before – to target Covid-19, cancer and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also from DeepMind, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaMissense&lt;/a&gt; tackles the problem of missense mutations – minor changes to genes, with uncertain functional impact. Despite their prevalence, we only know whether about 2% of these changes are pathogenic. AlphaMissense models the structure of the mutations using AlphaFold: if the protein structure changes, it’s probably pathogenic.

Doctors discovered bile duct cancer that had 'spread everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was more advanced than we could possibly imagine,' said Ms Ainsworth, a London-based lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though Jonathan was a doctor, he didn’t get checked immediately, he waited until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once you know that there’s something wrong, get yourself checked out as soon as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earliest signs that something was wrong began in 2019, when Mr Ainsworth — a keen runner who was 'always training' — started complaining of a pain in his stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He did little about it for several months, until he noticed he had begun to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-b7098980-0bbf-11f0-88c0-cb8b99931380"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jonathan Ainsworth, 59, was 'fit and healthy' and 'always running and training' before he was diagnosed with deadly bile duct cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he eventually spoke to a doctor, he was referred for a scan which revealed severe inflammation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting for the referral, the infectious disease specialist decided to take his own bloods, with the results showing something 'wasn't right'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went off to St Mary’s Hospital and they said that he had cancer,' said Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 2019, doctors revealed he had bile duct cancer, which affects around 3,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease impacts the tubes in the digestive system that carry bile; a fluid that helps the body digest food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 20 and 25 per cent of those diagnosed at the earliest stages will survive for more than five years, compared to between two and five per cent of those who are diagnosed later, when the cancer has spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the position of the bile ducts within the body, it easily migrates to other nearby organs, like the pancreas and the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bile duct cancer can be symptomless, particularly in its earliest stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when it does cause problems, signs include changes to your bowel habits, itchy skin, high temperature, abdominal pain and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite being a doctor, he left it 'too late' to seek medical help for his stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;His widow, Thelma Ainsworth, spent years struck with guilt about not pushing her husband to see a doctor sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Some also notice yellowing of the skin and the white of the eyes — known medically as jaundice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within three weeks of Mr Ainsworth's diagnosis he had 'gone', leaving her widowed with two young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon afterwards, she found that she started blaming herself, believing it was her fault for her husband's untimely death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since the diagnosis and for many months, maybe years afterwards, I blamed myself,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[I thought] that it was somehow my fault...because I didn’t get him to check himself out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, it 'all came to a head' while she was trying to write a children’s book — something she had wanted to do for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She discovered that her grief acted as a 'blockage' to her creative writing and decided to start journaling to help her process the difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These notes became the inspiration for her first memoir,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://mybook.to/IAmAWolfTonight"&gt; I Am A Wolf Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It was this blockage inside me that I felt I needed to release,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The book, which she described as 'raw, unflinching and honest', explores themes of cancer loss, complex grief, love, resilience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is 'no right or wrong way to do grief', according to Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she hopes her words will offer hope and encourage others to be patient and kind to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At some point you will reach a stage where you’re able to process that grief, but it will take years, and I’m not unusual in that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;' &lt;/span&gt;I hope that my book is helpful for anyone who’s been in that circumstance where they’ve had to go out of their way to reveal their inner animal in order to survive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:42:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxONFFFU2N3TGVQSUdpMHNjS1lySHRWdVduUUJpeFdUYWJrVFV3Mkp0clZMbFRTazA1Wkl0SHRoazJmZVJzcy11c2lvQnZtX0xIM1M4NzR3MFk2RWtQaDIzZVNxdEJvQVp2cXdqYzhoRWxIYm5ONGIxb0x6RVdrNHBzcUpHMFJCdUxDamUyNDRwODBXNzlVVFhfODV0dVZfRUdwTnMw0gGoAUFVX3lxTFB5Z3VKMWhuWFpxMWNZdWFWUC1VZ09EWjIzcklLMGVwLWZfdTlac0pIYzR2aXNSSzFlZVdlU3d0NWRrRzM1M09iUTFyMGJXcmJOOHJpRUg3U3lETy0yYkZGdGRtUTFmNVNPZ19wQnlJZUIxQ3lSZ05KQVhCWWxFcGdSN0tidWZJTjhmLVFGMDdKNVppTzE1bTFybGJ0MVotUXZsWGoxWTNxVw</guid></item><item><title>The Worst Habits for Your Back, According to Spine Surgeons - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPeFY2VUNaVWZ6X1NMMll1dHNtb3pUcjExTFdveDZwc0pTWUFVSHo5VzFlQ0RxNWpLQy01M1g0bWg4eUU0ZDRmSEdONzFhV05WX1JQMXBuc1FpQ0hNLVg4Xy1GYjFhYkFySEE5TlFOck1FaDNyUDRQb1N3SEZkcHp5Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As I write this, I’m wearing a large heating pad on my back like a cape. Why? Because when I parked my car at the grocery store, I made the mistake of twisting around to grab shopping bags from the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I felt a zing of pain in the middle of my back. Uh oh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db415-H.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that over a third of U.S. adults have experienced back pain during a three-month period — but few treatments actually work, according to a new &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/well/lower-back-pain-treatments-nsaids.html" title=""&gt;study that analyzed hundreds of trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So I thought it might be helpful to focus on how to prevent back pain in the first place. I’ve asked orthopedic doctors for their best tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7b752b55"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skip the “B.L.T.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;My car incident “is what we euphemistically call the B.L.T.,” or the bend, lift and twist, said Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins III, a neurosurgeon in New York City who specializes in spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doing all three actions at once, whether by shoveling snow or extracting a child from a car seat, “maximizes the stress on the disc, making it more likely to rupture,” Dr. Jenkins said. “As a spine surgeon, I would never do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you are about to B.L.T., take a beat and try to do each motion separately, Dr. Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When lifting an object, make sure both feet are planted and your weight is evenly distributed, said Dr. Gbolabo Sokunbi, a spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. Then lift from your legs instead of your arms and back, he said. Keep heavier items close to your body when picking them up, which puts &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="back.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74707-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;less strain&lt;/a&gt; on your spine, Dr. Sokunbi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

I’m an oncologist and a cancer epidemiologist, which means I investigate patterns and causes of cancers. As &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/12/alcohol-consumption-industry/" target="_blank"&gt;more Americans drink less&lt;/a&gt;, one question that has come up is whether casual drinking, or drinking alcohol infrequently, increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2SOVDF7K5BHHDWZLSOPAAOXFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The answer is “probably,” though at a very low level. Cancer risk is not binary: Having one drink, or smoking one cigarette, will not cause cancer. In general, the more you’re exposed to a risk factor, the higher your likelihood of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WBT2M2NOZBANNDSEOVN7LWRE4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read his full response below.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Medical disinformation connected to the West Texas measles outbreak has created a new problem. Children are being treated for toxic levels of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock confirms it is treating children with severe cases of measles who are also suffering from vitamin A toxicity. According to the hospital, they have admitted fewer than 10 pediatric patients who were all initially hospitalized due to measles complications but have elevated levels of vitamin A that is resulting in abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the CDC to update its measles guidance to promote the use of vitamin A. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, recommended in an article published March 2 on FOX News to take vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate and severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a March 4 interview on Fox News, Kennedy suggested that therapies such as the use of cod liver oil — which contains vitamins A and D — were "working" in treating measles patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports from the West Texas area that cod liver oil is in high demand and a big seller at area pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hospital is informing the public to reduce consumption of vitamin A and has warned that excessive amounts of it may result in significant adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that taking vitamin A will prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has administered vitamin A in Africa to reduce mortality during measles outbreaks. This is a strategy in a part of the world with widespread malnourishment, and vitamin A deficiency compromises the immune system. However, malnourishment is not a problem in West Texas or in other locations where the measles outbreak has spread in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 320 people in Texas have contracted measles in recent weeks. Forty people have been hospitalized in the state, and one child has died in the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

Wellness influencer Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/01/06/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-promotes-a-135-coffee-enema-kit/"&gt;promoted a DIY coffee enema&lt;/a&gt; kit on Goop, her lifestyle website – again &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-colonic-irrigation"&gt;drawing criticism&lt;/a&gt; from specialists who &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-doctors-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-1.4479955"&gt;urged Goop fans&lt;/a&gt; to "keep the coffee out of your rectum and in your cup".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the expert critique, coffee enemas continue to be a social media wellness trend offered in many alternative health clinics as a method to cleanse the colon and detoxify the body. More worryingly, coffee enemas are still recommended &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/apple-cider-vinegar-netflix"&gt;by some influencers&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;alternative treatment for cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pENvHuJd9MY?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why does the popularity of this controversial trend persist despite the bad press? Do the benefits of a coffee enema outweigh the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.bladderandbowel.org/medicinal-treatment/enema/"&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt; clears the bowel of faecal matter. Usually, the procedure involves inserting a nozzle attached to a pouch containing fluid into the rectum so the liquid can be squeezed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conventional medicine, enemas are used to clear the bowel before surgery, for severe cases of constipation or sometimes as part of a bowel management scheme – in people with inflammatory bowel diseases, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://colonic-association.org/colon-hydrotherapy/history"&gt;It's claimed&lt;/a&gt; by some coffee enema advocates that, before the advent of modern painkillers, Florence Nightingale used coffee enemas as a form of pain management in soldiers during the Crimean War, and doctors used them &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/module-28-charlotte-gerson/umc.cmc.vid7anfcpffn43gs2zg7eku0"&gt;in the second world war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156658" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg" alt="colon illustration" class="wp-image-156658 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-467x415.jpg 467w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-600x534.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Enemas have been used to clear the bowel for people with inflammatory bowel diseases. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library Getty)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the advances in medicine and technology since Nightingale was nursing injured soldiers, coffee enemas continue to be promoted as a health practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt; continues to be highly publicised as an alternative option to chemotherapy. Patients follow a strict organic vegetarian diet, which can include up to 13 glasses of fruit juice and up to five coffee enemas daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gerson Institute &lt;a href="https://gerson.org/faqs/"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the enemas can increase gut movement which helps to empty bowels. Coffee enemas are believed to help the body expel toxins from the liver and gut, which is thought to relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee contains compounds &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;kahweol and cafestol&lt;/a&gt;, thought to boost an enzyme which helps remove harmful substances from the body. These substances are turned into bile salts and expelled from the body. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30387-0/fulltext"&gt;caffeine in coffee is thought&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate the liver and widen the bile ducts to increase the flow of bile and help remove toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show there is no evidence to prove this regime works to cure cancer and it is not supported by any reputable cancer organisations. But it's possible the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect might help some patients feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; showed there were more reports about the side effects of coffee enemas than their efficacy. Some people, for instance, experienced &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acgcr/fulltext/2020/01000/proctocolitis_from_coffee_enema.8.aspx"&gt;proctocolitis&lt;/a&gt; – inflamed rectum and colon – and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20073005/"&gt;rectal burns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtFDVWQhEF0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Self-cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the amount of waste that is expelled from the gut, coffee enemas can remove potassium from the body. This can lead to electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, muscle weakness and nausea. In &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;severe cases&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause irregular heartbeats and lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any enemas regularly for a long time can cause the bowel muscle to weaken, which is linked to constipation and inflammation of the bowel. In some &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/enemas/#:%7E:text=Many%20proponents%20of%20using%20home,balance%20and%20cause%20digestive%20symptoms."&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, enemas may damage the balance of good bacteria in the gut, which can cause cramping, diarrhoea and bloating and increase the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There no need for DIY enemas of any kind: the gut is self-cleaning. Regular digestion and bowel movements means the body gets rid of waste naturally. A high-fibre diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and seeds should be enough for good digestive health and could even &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/wholegrains-fibre-and-cancer-risk#"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/health-and-lifestyle/fibre/how-to-increase-your-fibre-intake/"&gt;Current advice&lt;/a&gt; suggests we consume at least 30 g of fibre daily. Most adults, however, have an average of only 19 g of fibre daily. Drinking plenty of water &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/water-a-fluid-way-to-manage-constipation"&gt;is also crucial&lt;/a&gt; to gut health. &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2017.1383355"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that eating &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fermentation"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as kimchi, kefir and kombucha, can help the good bacteria in the gut and aid with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee is more likely to be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/all-the-reasons-a-cup-of-coffee-really-can-be-good-for-you-236852"&gt;beneficial for health&lt;/a&gt; than coffee enemas. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007311"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that moderate coffee intake is linked to lower risk of heart disease, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media can be a useful way to learn about health but it's important to check who is giving this information – do they have credentials to back up their claims? It's always best to check with your doctor or specialist before embarking on any alternative or complementary therapies.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252412/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Although &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/donanemab-licensed-for-early-stages-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adult-patients-who-have-one-or-no-copies-of-apolipoprotein-e4-gene"&gt;some recently developed drugs&lt;/a&gt; show promise in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lecanemab-licensed-for-adult-patients-in-the-early-stages-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;slowing the progress&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, these are both costly and may have limited benefit for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.70037"&gt;recent Cambridge-led study&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between commonly used prescription drugs – including antibiotics, antivirals and vaccines – and a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these drugs are already licensed and their safety profiles well established, this could enable faster and more cost-effective clinical trials in the search for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.70037"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; analysed health data from 130 million people, including one million people who had been diagnosed with dementia. Having identified possible links with prescription drugs and dementia risk, the researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 14 studies to explore these links further and understand which prescription drugs might affect dementia outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led them to the conclusion that antibiotics, antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs were all associated with reduced dementia risk. The researchers also found a link between the hepatitis A, typhoid and diphtheria vaccines and lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how long participants had been taking any of these prescription drugs or how many times they’d been prescribed them during their lifetime, so it will be important for future studies to investigate these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune reponse and brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that the protective effects that these prescription drugs appear to have may be because they reduce inflammation, control infections and improve overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the theory that common types of dementia could be triggered by &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/possible-risks-of-dementia/infections#:%7E:text=Research%20suggests%20that%20infections%20may,you%20maintain%20good%20dental%20health."&gt;viral or bacterial infections&lt;/a&gt;. We know that infections that last a few days to several weeks, whether bacterial or viral, can cause great &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8668867"&gt;damage to the brain&lt;/a&gt;. This is because infections cause an enhanced immune response from the body, which can damage brain cells – disrupting brain connections and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35234334/"&gt;accelerating memory decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antivirals and antibiotics help combat infections, which in turn may dampen this excessive immune response. Meanwhile, vaccines can prevent these infections from occurring in the first place. In both cases, this can significantly reduce the risk of prolonged infections and their potentially devastating consequences for &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.872542/full"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that other studies have also shown an association between the BCG vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis, and a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096999611730030X?via%3Dihub"&gt;decreased risk&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer’s (a type of dementia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammation and dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the new study’s finding of a link between the use of anti-inflammatory medications and a reduced risk of dementia, notably non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen were identified as potentially protecting against memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is another piece of evidence suggesting that inflammation plays a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8775769/"&gt;central role in dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01486-5"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is the body’s natural way of defending itself against injury or infection. But when inflammation lasts too long, it can cause harm – particularly to the brain. Long-lasting inflammation releases chemicals that can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10419139/#:%7E:text=During%20neuroinflammation%2C%20the%20participation%20of,that%20lead%20to%20neuronal%20damage."&gt;damage healthy tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These chemicals can damage brain cells and disrupt communication between them, which leads to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-inflammatory drugs work by blocking the production of certain molecules that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192366/#:%7E:text=The%20aspirin%20study%20found%20that,of%20the%20results%20on%20NSAIDs.&amp;amp;text=This%20review%20found%20no%20evidence,studies%20of%20the%20same%20medicines."&gt;cause inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. By doing this, they might help protect brain cells from damage caused by long-term inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence for the benefits of other types of drugs on dementia risk was less consistent. The study found that certain blood-pressure drugs, antidepressants and diabetes drugs were linked to both a lower and higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that these prescription drugs affect different biological processes. Even drugs designed to treat the same condition may target different biological mechanisms, which might explain the varying results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some blood pressure medications – such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19378"&gt;blockers&lt;/a&gt; (ARBs) – improve brain health by enhancing blood flow and reducing inflammation. On the other hand, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/40/Supplement_1/ehz748.0348/5598071"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; primarily lower heart rate and may not provide the same neuroprotective benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes drugs also had mixed associations with dementia risk. But as people with diabetes are already at a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11892-014-0487-z"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing dementia, this makes it difficult to determine whether this association was due to the effects of the drugs themselves, or if diabetes is the main factor at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, more research is needed to confirm this study’s findings and better understand how all these drugs appear to influence dementia risk. Randomised controlled trials will be crucial to see if these prescription drugs really can be repurposed to prevent dementia effectively. At the same time, looking into the biological mechanisms that are potentially affected by these drugs could shed light on the causes of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the importance of addressing inflammation and infections as part of a broader strategy for maintaining brain health.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Bucks County are reporting &lt;a href="https://www.buckscounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1251"&gt;a new case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in a resident and are warning other people they may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus last week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An adult resident tested positive for &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/measles-rubeola"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; after recently traveling to Texas, according to the county health department, and visited several locations back in Pennsylvania while potentially contagious.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said anyone who visited the Starbucks at 2896 S. Eagle Rd. in Newtown on March 19 between 10:50 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. could have been exposed. They should monitor for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;early symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including cough, runny nose, red eyes, headache, sneezing and a red skin rash, said county experts.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The health department has completed contact tracing at all other locations where this adult traveled upon returning to Pennsylvania. Officials said Thursday that anyone potentially exposed “will be notified.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles, which spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids or through respiratory droplets in the air, could start experiencing symptoms within 10 to 14 days after exposure, according to the health department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who begins to experience symptoms or feel ill should immediately contact their health providers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of infection or severe illness remains low among people who received the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for children as young as 12 months old.

“It supports the creation of enzymes and hormones, boosts immune function, and helps transport nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I'm not alone: Whether or not they know it, much of women in the United States are suffering from a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-deficiency-signs" target="_blank"&gt;protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. “Inadequate protein intake can have widespread negative effects on the body, impacting multiple systems and functions,” says Barmmer, listing off a host of symptoms I'm simply not interested in, including feeling weak, reduced strength, brittle hair and nails, reduced ability to fight infection or illness, and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to asking “how much protein do I need?” the nutritionist also shares some simple rules: If you're a sedndary adult, aim for 1 gram for every kilogram you weigh; if you're an active adult, 1.6 to 2.2 grams per every kilogram you weigh; and if you're over the age of 65, 1.2 to 1.5 grams per every kilogram you weigh. So if you weigh 165 pounds, that translates to 72.5 kilograms, so you're aiming for 72.5 grams of protein a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phew, this is even more intimidating than I thought! In an attempt to step up my protein game, Barmmer compiled a list of foods for me to eat as much as possible—and I'm sharing it with you. 2025 is the year of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating fish, not all have the same amount of protein. There are more than &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/102331/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;36 varieties that the FDA declares as healthy options&lt;/a&gt;, and the four that are the highest when it comes to protein are tuna (24.4g of protein in a 100 g serving for ahi tuna), salmon (25.92g in a 100g serving), cod (19.36 g of protein in a 100 g serving), and mackerel (25.45 g of protein in a 100 g serving).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hemp Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds may be tiny, but they are surprisingly mighty. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Two tablespoons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank"&gt;hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt; have just as much protein as two egg whites—along with all nine essential amino acids (a rarity), omega-3, and omega-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs should absolutely be part of your weekly rotation, but you want to eat the egg with the yolk,” says Barmmer. In a large egg, you'll get about six grams of available protein. “Eggs also have a good dose of brain and liver and gall bladder supporting choline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While they can and should be part of your rotation, don’t expect things like peanut butter to be a significant protein source in your diet,” levels Barmmer. "They will give a small boost but it simply requires too much in terms of volume and calories to reach your protein needs with them. For example, it would take 679 calories worth of peanut butter (7 tablespoons) to equal 175 calories of a 3-ounce serving of lean beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're gluten-free, plant-based, or on a whole foods diet, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-benefits-of-quinoa" target="_blank"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt; should be a big part of your diet. “This grain-like seed is one of the few complete plant protein sources providing about 8 grams per cup,” says Barmmer. “It’s rich in magnesium and fiber as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Greek Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thicker and creamier than regular yogurt because it's fermented for longer, Greek yogurt's health benefits far surpass the OG variety. “From a nutrition perspective, Greek yogurt typically has significantly more protein—often two times as much!—and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt,” says clinical nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Hodson&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, CDCES at NYU Langone Health. It's also a fantastic source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/calcium-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;calcium,&lt;/a&gt; which helps maintain strong bones and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big on social media recently, cottage cheese is having a come back. “Just half of a cup of cottage cheese can provide between 12 and 16 grams of protein,” says Barmmer. All you need to do is read the label. “It contains casein, a slow-digesting protein that supports muscle repair and growth. It’s filling and rich in calcium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Powders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein powders or collagen peptides are a great addition to you diet if you're looking to up your intake. “Collagen peptides are a convenient, bioavailable, and effective way to support your body's collagen needs, particularly as production naturally declines with age,” says Barmmer. “Adding them to your diet can help maintain youthful skin, strong joints, and overall connective tissue health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The debate on the sustainability of beef is nuanced and requires a separate discussion, but if you can put that aside and purely look at nutrition quality, it’s really difficult to beat beef,” Barmmer says. “This is one of the most nutrient-dense sources of protein available and is a great idea to include in weekly meal plans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:52:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE0xVi1xbVhRRmphV0tER0lpejBOU1BiVXpHaldlXzVpUEZJa3ZUMlRDUXJ2UHJ0QlI5bEpBM1FuaEVFam1RNFJkb1dhRjRoRDVyRlYzdFB1MEJwbHRK</guid></item><item><title>Measles - United States of America - World Health Organization</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBqbDh4S01TaHA3cmZXR2QtU0o0NUQ3M2pnb0l6a0taYk1FRlhSLXNEVlFEQ2lnSzZwNWRHUG9JXzhxOGNJZEFLVVRHMEJiampGaWZMVXRSS3gxTnc3azRpTnFjNnFIeWhSV0Z4ZGs1cVlESHd4MExqRldB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="sf-detail-body-wrapper don-revamp"&gt;
        

                

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 11 March 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) received a report from the International Health Regulation (2005) (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of the United States of America (United States) on the ongoing measles outbreak in the country, notified under IHR because it is an unusual event with potential significant public health impact, with the number of cases and deaths in 2025 exceeding the numbers in previous years. Additionally, cases linked to the outbreak in the State of Texas, United States, have been reported in Mexico.
Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death.
From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 17 States have reported a total of 378 cases of measles, including two deaths - the first deaths related to measles in the United States in a decade. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and the overall hospitalization rate is 17%. In 2025, within the larger public health event, there are three distinct measles outbreaks reported, accounting for 90% (341/378) of reported cases. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (US CDC) and other government agencies are working to control the outbreaks. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, since then imported cases of measles have been detected in the country, as the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 11 March 2025, the NFP of the United States notified to WHO an ongoing outbreak of measles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 378 cases have been reported from 17 States including: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Two deaths have also been reported, one confirmed in Texas and one under investigation in New Mexico. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. The hospitalization rate is 17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of the 378 cases (341 cases) have been associated with three distinct outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025, while the remainder are sporadic cases that are part of the larger outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From late January until 14 March 2025, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 259 cases in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. Of these, 34 patients have been hospitalized, and 257 (99%) were unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status. In February 2025, an unvaccinated school-aged child who lived in the Texas outbreak area died of measles. This was the first death in the United States related to measles in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 14 March, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 35 cases of measles. Of the 35 cases, 28 were unvaccinated, two were vaccinated, and five had unknown vaccination status&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2025 to 20 March 2025, the US CDC reported 128 measles DNA sequences. Texas submitted 92 identical DNA sequences in genotype D8; while 10 DNA sequences from New Mexico and one DNA sequence from Kansas were identical to those from Texas. Texas also reported three genotype D8 sequences (a total of 19 D8 sequences have been reported from the affected States) with single nucleotide substitutions. Additionally, a total of five distinct genotype B3 sequences were reported from the States of Alaska, California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of this outbreak is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence of decreased vaccine effectiveness or changes in the virus that would result in increased severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, measles was declared eliminated&lt;sup&gt;[1] &lt;/sup&gt;in the United States and, since then, imported cases of measles have been detected in the country since the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  The United States last verified the ongoing elimination of measles in 2024. In 2023, the vaccination coverage rate for two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among children in kindergarten in the United States was 92.7%.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease which affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash usually appears 10-14 days after exposure and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious from four days before up to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur in about one in every 1000 reported cases. About two or three deaths may occur for every 1000 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization against measles prevents measles and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal, State, local health authorities and community partners in the United States are implementing the following public health measures to control the outbreak: US CDC escalated to a level 3 Incident Management Structure on 3 March 2025 to provide remote technical assistance on diagnostics, post-exposure prophylaxis, healthcare infection and prevention, case investigation and confirmation, and communication support. The Texas Department of State Health Services is leading the investigation in Texas. US CDC deployed subject matter experts to assist the response. WHO has issued epidemiological alerts and updates due to the increase in measles cases in several countries in the WHO Region of the Americas that started in 2024. WHO continues to monitor the situation and work closely with countries in the Region of the Americas to support their vaccination, surveillance and rapid outbreak response efforts to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles and to protect the health of the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The transmission mode is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. A rash develops several days later, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment approved for measles; most people recover within 2-3 weeks. Measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia, which are more common in children under 5 years and adults more than 20 years of age. Measles can be prevented by immunization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first WHO Region to be declared free of the endemic transmission of measles by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas. Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public health risk in the Region of the Americas for measles is considered high due to the persistence of the circulation of the virus from imported cases, which have resulted in a limited number of outbreaks, with several generations of cases and the appearance of cases associated with pre-existing outbreaks in new geographical areas. Additionally, an increase in the susceptible population due to persistently low vaccination coverage related to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, increased vaccine hesitancy in some communities and sectors of the population, and limited access to health services, particularly for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up-to-date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas within the United States should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all settings, consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis, including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR) and/or MMR vaccine, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure, including when planning to travel to the United States. Unvaccinated individuals from areas in the United States experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite his allegiance to the conspiracist far-right and a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rfk-jr-mcdonalds-meal-seed-oil-1235169870/"&gt;McDonald’s visit &lt;/a&gt;with anti-vax health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; draws the line at claiming that vaccines are totally ineffective and potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Earlier this week, Musk’s podcaster pal &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/joe-rogan/"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; hosted Dr. Suzanne Humphries, a nephrologist who co-wrote the self-published 2013 book &lt;em&gt;Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History&lt;/em&gt;, which falsely claims that vaccines do not account for the decline of infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. In her interview, Humphries advanced her conspiracist narrative that medical researchers falsified their data in order to justify vaccinations, whereas what really made people ill were environmental toxins spread through poor sanitation and hygiene — which rapidly improved from the Nineteenth century onward, stemming the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Humphries made one outrageously false claim after another on Rogan’s &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/podcast-2/" id="auto-tag_podcast-2" data-tag="podcast-2"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, at various points claiming that tuberculosis “was a side effect of the smallpox vaccine,” that polio cases were caused by the insecticide DDT, and that Covid-19 was lab-engineered to include “snake toxin proteins,” apparently echoing a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/covid-19-is-caused-by-a-virus-not-snake-venom-idUSL2N2WJ244/#:~:text=Reuters%20has%20previously%20addressed%20false,sodium%20acetate%20trihydrate%2C%20and%20sucrose." target="_blank"&gt;years-old conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt; about people getting the disease from snake venom in drinking water. “I would have told you that vaccines are one of the most important inventions in human history,” Rogan told Humphries during their conversation, appearing to accept everything she told him as fact. “And it saved us from polio, it saved us from smallpox. I would have been that guy ranting off all those statistics. I would have told you that. But then I read your book.” He also said: “Giving a Covid shot to a baby today is insane.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“‘Dissolving Illusions’ is a really great book,” Rogan later &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/joerogan/status/1905249814251504058" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X, sharing a post from a user who declared the Humphries episode “his most important podcast of the year.” He went on to note, “I probably would have never thought about exploring the real history of vaccines if we hadn’t gone through the insane Covid gaslighting of the last 5 years, but after Dr. Humphries’ book I’ll never look at it the same way again. She’s a very brave and brilliant woman.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Musk, a repeat Rogan guest who typically aligns with him on culture war issues — the pair also backed &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 election — pushed back on his social media platform, though still hedged slightly. “My opinion on the subject: If forced to choose between greatly improved sanitation and vaccines, sanitation matters much more,” declared the oligarch now overseeing the decimation of federal agencies and regulators by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “But vaccines, essentially training your immune system for battle, do work well for addressing many diseases. The essence of science is continuously looking at the evidence to lessen the error between your understanding of reality and reality itself.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Vaccines are a peculiar fault line within the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/maga/"&gt;MAGA&lt;/a&gt; movement that Musk and Rogan have joined. Trump, for instance, has sought to take credit for the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/covid-19/"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccines developed during his first term, yet a significant portion of the GOP base now &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/23/gop-voters-vaccines-poll-00117125" target="_blank"&gt;distrusts vaccine science&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into a partisan issue since the advent of the pandemic. As head of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has already moved to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule for diseases including polio and measles, which this year has &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;infected hundreds and killed two&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;hired a discredited anti-vax researcher&lt;/a&gt; to study the long-debunked “connection” between immunizations and autism. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;misleadingly claimed&lt;/a&gt; that factors such as malnutrition or preexisting health conditions contribute to measles infections, and downplayed the possible effects of the disease, which can permanently blind or deafen patients who survive it, touting the benefits of natural immunity post-infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Similarly, Humphries seemed to suggest on Rogan’s podcast that polio is not the terror that many people imagine it to be, since most cases are asymptomatic. But in the mid-Twentieth century, it killed or paralyzed &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination#:~:text=In%20the%20late%2019th%20and,the%20disease%20faced%20lifelong%20consequences." target="_blank"&gt;half a million people each year&lt;/a&gt; worldwide and was a major cause of childhood disability. The worst recorded outbreak in U.S. history, in 1952, saw 3,000 people die. Thanks to safe and effective vaccines that first became available in 1955, polio was considered to be &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in North and South America as of 1994.





&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Musk has turned X, formerly Twitter, into a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/"&gt;haven for misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, often amplifying such content himself. So it was no surprise that his gentle pushback on Rogan’s vaccine skepticism drew plenty of dissent in the replies. “I started down the vaccine rabbit hole after Covid-19, and I now suspect that we’ve been lied to on an industrial scale about them,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1905293633277788296" target="_blank"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; a verified blue-check user with more than 100,000 followers. “I think the evidence, if we look at it honestly, shows overwhelmingly that vaccines are unnecessary at best, and have caused tremendous harm/negligible benefit at worst.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Given the kind of platform and audience he has cultivated, it doesn’t appear that Musk will be earning plaudits for going against the emerging consensus in his party that inoculations are worse than the diseases they guard against. It’ll certainly be surprising if he challenges this worldview again.&lt;/p&gt;

Reducing salt intake as a national guideline is also a safe bet for the population to achieve a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Plus, with our car-dependent, relatively sedentary lifestyles, the average American is at greater risk at overconsumption of sodium than underconsumption, says Raeeda Gheewala, a nephrologist and founder of the clinic Sports Nephrology. When it comes to the recommended 2.3-gram sodium limit, “I don't think it's too stringent in this country,” she adds. Eating at home is the easiest way to control how much salt goes in our food. To that end, “grocery shopping is the most important part of the process,” Gheewala says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:59:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPVEhSOEtXT0JwYVBjNElZa19FN1UzQkxHWjluaGd1X2h3QWhzcnNtOEJOMFZXelVtaDhiSFJXWXpmUTl5RHFKYlNLZVEzZXdHbzN0elVUc3Fqc3ZXTTBvZ0NaUGpxcThDa3VUSjh2Uk9GblJDMG9HLUphOEtjT3dIYk8yY3M5SlE</guid></item><item><title>Surge of dead birds on South Haven beaches, DNR urges caution - WWMT-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPOXZKQldnOGhVeW9RLWRLY3kyS3AyQ3BxMFNHNE5PVHNPdFNBM1VlZzJsSFRGaGJORDZVSnhzNGlXc0c5TTVFdEV1VVNRUlV5eTRxN05BQ2ZUY3hSYVh6UmZwUmJrVk1aT0J2eWUxTmNaclNabUgxYTdIaDFuYWRTYUxLa2JrT0lQZHhHNmg1cGxQNGRGTTF0QThjcUs0VTk4TEtscjU1RnM5VEVpcERFTFBuek9fSlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SOUTH HAVEN, Mich. — &lt;/span&gt;Residents of South Haven are expressing concern after discovering a large number of dead birds along shoreline, prompting fears of potential avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty Girard, a South Haven resident, told News Channel 3 she and her husband Larry woke up to find bird carcasses sprawling the beach outside of their North Beach condo, leading her to wonder, "Could this be bird flu?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey of the area revealed more than 100 dead birds, a figure confirmed by the DNR, which said current estimates show at least 130 birds have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beachgoers are being urged by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the City of South Haven to avoid the birds whenever possible to prevent potential spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan DNR is investigating the situation, saying that affected species include long-tailed ducks and murky Merganser, which are well-adapted to Lake Michigan's stormy conditions. For this reason, they said that highly pathogenic avian influenza is being considered as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of what we're looking at here and other potential specimens that ended up, we really are only focused on how highly pathogenic avian influenza has affected those wild birds," said Rachel Lincoln with the DNR's Wildlife Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNR said samples have been collected and sent out to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostics Lab for testing, however, results may be delayed due to a nationwide outbreak backlog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh carcasses can carry diseases, but as decomposition occurs, the risk of virus transmission decreases, so leaving them to decompose naturally in remote areas where they "do not pose a risk" is best practice, according to the city and DNR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If disposal is necessary, according to the DNR, it is crucial for people to cover their skin completely, including wearing a mask, to double bag the carcasses and place them directly into the trash. Then, wash your clothes in hot water, dispose of items that touched the carcass, and sanitize your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of South Haven said staff is continuing to monitor and clear public beaches, but private property owners are responsible for their own cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNR said that if you observe six or more dead birds in one area, you should report it on their "&lt;a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home" target="_blank" title="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Eyes in the Field&lt;/a&gt;" platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about human health and safety should be forwarded to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services at 517-335-8165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If bird flu is suspected in a domestic flock, contact Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) immediately at 800-292- 3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after hours).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT-TV</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:38:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPOXZKQldnOGhVeW9RLWRLY3kyS3AyQ3BxMFNHNE5PVHNPdFNBM1VlZzJsSFRGaGJORDZVSnhzNGlXc0c5TTVFdEV1VVNRUlV5eTRxN05BQ2ZUY3hSYVh6UmZwUmJrVk1aT0J2eWUxTmNaclNabUgxYTdIaDFuYWRTYUxLa2JrT0lQZHhHNmg1cGxQNGRGTTF0QThjcUs0VTk4TEtscjU1RnM5VEVpcERFTFBuek9fSlU</guid></item><item><title>My Daughter-in-Law Demands That I Babysit Her Toddlers for Days on End.

Our grandchildren are all grown, and one is expecting what will be our first great grandchild. Our son seemed to be a lifelong bachelor until he met and married “Stacy.” They currently have a 4-year-old and a toddler—and much as we adore them, it is very hard to be around them without help. We just don’t have the energy, mobility, and money to spare to spoil our grandchildren like we did their cousins back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Our daughter-in-law will make backhanded comments about how our other grandchildren were obviously our favorites because we did things like watch them all summer or take trips to Disneyland. These days, it is very hard for either of us to bend down and pick up fallen items. When we go shopping, we need to use scooters because just crossing the grocery store is an ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsk8z00273572evkrjein@published"&gt;This situation hurts us because our son keeps echoing his wife. We ended up having a huge fight because Stacy wanted to go to some convention and our son didn’t feel comfortable watching both children for a three-day weekend without help. My husband and I told him that wouldn’t be possible for us to come over and help. Firstly, their guest room is on the second floor and the stairs are steep. Plus, the guest bathroom is downstairs. We have to get up several times a night to use the bathroom. Our conversation got heated and then Stacy accused us out of the blue of trying to sabotage her career. Stacy has been trying to start her own business since she married our son and every attempt went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand it was hurtful, but I didn’t think it was enough for my son and his wife to completely cut us off. But they will not answer the phone and refuse to even send pictures of their children. We are heartbroken and our other children are furious at their brother. We don’t want our family to split apart over pettiness like this. We already sent Stacy a card and flowers for her birthday and apologized. No response. What else can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

More and more Americans these days seem to have &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;the mistaken idea&lt;/a&gt; that any problem with your body is in your mind, surmountable if you really wish it to be, and perhaps that’s Stacy’s issue. But she had kids with a guy who had older parents. She’s &lt;a href="https://hmmdaily.com/2018/10/18/your-real-biological-clock-is-youre-going-to-die/"&gt;running up against biology&lt;/a&gt;, and in denial about what that actually means. Maybe she’s under a lot of pressure to show that she can succeed in her business, maybe she’s annoyed that her husband is apparently only minimally useful in the arena of childcare, or maybe she’s just plain unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskn0002d3572dz6seqy5@published"&gt;I can’t figure out from afar what is wrong with this lady. But she’s married to your son—who, by the way, is the one who “doesn’t feel comfortable” watching the kids for three days without help. He could do any number of other things to fix this problem, besides expecting you to visit. My number one suggestion would be that he should simply buck up! But he could also hire paid outside help to come cover him for periods of time during the weekend, so he has rest breaks; or make plans to order in meals so he doesn’t have to cook; or band together with local parent friends to make plans to meet at a playground during the days, so he has some adult contact and a pressure valve for that much togetherness. Some combination of these strategies would be what a mother in this situation would do. Why can’t he?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskpy002e3572zotlyku5@published"&gt;It also bothers me that your son doesn’t seem to register, or care, how big the disconnect between your reality and Stacy’s understanding of your life has become. The fight between Stacy and your husband is a red herring in this story, though it was likely hurtful of your husband to say what he said. It’s your son who’s the issue. I’m glad that your other kids seem to be more understanding of your situation. Perhaps they, who hopefully are not also blocked from his phone, could help explain it to him.&lt;/p&gt;

Their divorce was fairly civilized and I adore my nephews and nieces, so I often help out by dropping the kids off at school, babysitting, or helping her fix things around the house. Over Christmas, my brother unloaded on me, accusing me of disloyalty and “sniffing around” his ex, before demanding that I keep away from her and his kids. It was a very ugly scene, which really upset my parents, and I’m still chewing over it but I am also wondering whether I need to give in to his unreasonable and selfish demands. I don’t want to further inflame whatever is going on with him and his ex, or drag the kids into further drama, but I equally don’t want to just ghost my niblings or my sister-in-law. Do I just discuss it with her? I’d talk to my brother but, as you may have guessed, he’s not particularly reasonable or mature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslcs002k3572ml2vrpt6@published"&gt;Clearly there are things going on beneath the surface here with this divorce that are not “civilized”—not exactly. I would at the very least update your perception of this particular situation, from “they seem mostly fine” to “volatile; beware.” Your brother seems quite triggered by the idea that you’re doing the things he used to do—I bet he’s probably way more upset by “helping her fix things around the house” than by anything else on this list of acts of service. (Would he be this mad if you just did some school runs, barely speaking to her at all? I doubt it!) This is a fevered mindset he may come out of with time, but not one that will respond well to rationality, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslen002l3572vvkbwy5v@published"&gt;Sadly, I do think you might need to wait a minute to go back to being “there” for them—or, find some ways to do this that don’t directly involve being around her, or being in her house. (Maybe the kids could come to your parents’ house without her, and you could see them there, for example.) I don’t think you should totally ghost her, though I bet if you did, she would be able to guess why you did it. You could let her know why you’re pulling back, and stipulate that you didn’t mind doing any of those jobs for her—and hope to be able to do so again in the future. This doesn’t have to be forever. But they are the ones who have to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

My two younger sisters did not get along with her husband’s daughter, “Julie.” I thought it was basic teenage drama until recently. Julie and my younger sister are both engaged. I have a different dad than my sisters and make a pretty good living working for him. I offered to give my sister around $10,000 for the wedding, since she and her partner are teachers and as poor as church mice.&lt;/p&gt;

Julie and I don’t have a relationship. I saw her a few times while she was still living at home, but we don’t even exchange Christmas cards. But she thinks I should pay for her wedding? I would basically tell Julie to get bent, but my mom isn’t in good health and doesn’t need this stress in her life. Her husband seems to have no spine when it comes to Julie. Both my sisters have stated they hate Julie and think she is a brat, but again are worried about our mom. My mom wants me to make a “better effort” here, but will not say what that is, besides just paying up the cash.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, you don’t need to give Julie money, let alone ten thousand big ones, out of some family connection that’s more legal and technical than it is emotional or even biological. You could toss her a Christmas card, sure, and certainly you should be civil and friendly when you’re in proximity to one another, for the sake of your relatives, but I think that’s the extent of your obligation to this person.&lt;/p&gt;

He should care, too, about whether your mom is stressed! Why is that caring left up to you and your sisters? Can you talk to him and see if he can talk to Julie?

With 45 tumors on her right side and 12 on her left, the San Francisco mom, then 47, was told, “I would likely die in three to six months,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiRCwsZ_fBs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABC7 News.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ABC7 News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began undergoing a rigorous treatment — seven surgeries, and up to 11 hours of chemotherapy, three times a week, which she estimated totaled about 180 chemotherapy treatments over nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/gma3-demarco-morgan-colonoscopy-friends-colorectal-cancer-prevention-exclusive-8558677" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GMA3’s DeMarco Morgan Gets Colonoscopy with Friends to Normalize Men Talking to Each Other About Health (Exclusive);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;GMA3&lt;/em&gt;’s DeMarco Morgan Gets Colonoscopy with Friends to Normalize Men Talking to Each Other About Health (Exclusive)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I challenge them, I don’t just take the first no,” she told the outlet about how she collaborated with her medical team. But now, Comer, 55, is receiving hospice care at home. “It’s not really a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemotherapy was making me sicker so I couldn’t recover,” Comer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared that she was diagnosed before the colonoscopy screening age was moved down to 45, adding that if she’d been able to get screened, the cancer might have been caught sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would have been inconvenienced for maybe 18 months, but it wouldn’t have been a death sentence,” Comer told the outlet, sharing that her daughter, Olivia, and her husband, keep her going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a woman receiving chemotherapy through a port.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/chrissy-teigen-shares-update-first-colonoscopy-good-nap-7563343" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chrissy Teigen Shares Update After Getting First Colonoscopy: 'It Was a Good Nap’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Chrissy Teigen Shares Update After Getting First Colonoscopy: 'It Was a Good Nap’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who would ever want to leave this beautiful world?” she said.  “I keep saying the same thing over and over: Screen early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer rates among people &lt;a href="https://people.com/cancer-82-higher-in-young-women-than-men-breast-colorectal-8775570" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:younger than 50;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;younger than 50&lt;/a&gt; have increased by 2.4% per year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; reports — and mortality rates have increased by 1% per year.

			&lt;p&gt;It may not just be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-the-uk-predicted-to-have-dental-disease-by-2050-study-finds"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt; you need to worry about when it comes to sugary drinks: new research suggests that these sweetened beverages might also be raising the risk of oral  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="155908" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Washington crunched the numbers from a public health database, looking at records covering the dietary habits of 162,602 women, 124 of whom developed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"&gt;oral cancer&lt;/a&gt; over a 30-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with women who drank less than one sugary drink per month, those who indulged in one or more sugary drinks daily were 4.87 times more likely to develop oral cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who didn't drink alcohol or smoke much or at all, but consumed one or more sugary drinks daily, were at 5.46 times higher risk of oral cancer than women who drank less than one sugary drink each month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The incidence of oral cavity cancer (OCC) is increasing among non-smokers and young individuals without traditional risk factors worldwide," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this study, high sugar-sweetened beverage intake was associated with a significantly increased risk of OCC in women, regardless of smoking or drinking habits, yet with low baseline risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of this study means it does not show direct cause and effect, because other factors may be involved that the researchers haven't accounted for. However, the association is strong enough to suggest there is some relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, oral cancer &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html"&gt;is linked to&lt;/a&gt; risk factors such as smoking or chewing tobacco, drinking heavily, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It's a real concern that oral cancer cases are quickly rising outside of these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155911" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155911" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking.jpg" alt="Man smoking" class="wp-image-155911 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155911" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oral cancer has traditionally been linked to risk factors such as smoking. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-smoking-a-cigarette-in-the-dark-wQv94mB3TcY"&gt;Reza Mehrad/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason that's been put forward for this is our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/western-diet-identified-as-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-scientists-warn"&gt;changing dietary habits&lt;/a&gt;. The unhealthy foods many of us are now consuming on a regular basis could be triggering long-term inflammatory responses from the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A Western dietary pattern has increasingly been recognized as a risk factor for gastrointestinal tract cancers and is characterized by high consumption of saturated fats, processed foods, and added sugars," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hypothesis is that diets with higher added sugar may contribute to chronic inflammation, which may, in turn, contribute to the risk of OCC."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations here – the study only looked at data for women, and covers a relatively low number of cancer cases – and the researchers are keen for more data to be collected and assessed on this potential link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's another compelling reason for us to watch what we drink as well as what we eat. The health dangers associated with sugary drinks aren't new, but we're now realizing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-quantified-the-harm-of-sugary-drinks-and-its-devastating"&gt;just how harmful&lt;/a&gt; they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The methodology and quality of the study are excellent and the data has been analysed in great detail," &lt;a href="https://sciencemediacentre.es/en/study-shows-women-high-consumption-sugary-drinks-was-associated-increased-risk-oral-cavity-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Raúl Zamora Ros, from the Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) in Spain, who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More studies are needed to confirm these associations and also to assess whether soft drinks with artificial sweeteners would be just as harmful, as many people substitute one for the other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Otolaryngology – Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And the latest news that the Trump administration has tapped David Geier for a study on possible links between immunizations and autism, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;first reported by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geier has a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28Geier+DA%5BAuthor%5D%29+AND+%28autism%29+AND+%28thimerosal%29"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of promoting &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-mmr"&gt;the debunked claim&lt;/a&gt; of a link between vaccines and autism, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/26/rfk-jr-vaccine-study-of-autism-links-led-by-vaccine-critic-scientists-shocked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; and others report&lt;/a&gt;. He has published on the topic as recently as 2020. A December 2020 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534375/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; lists his affiliation as the Institute of Chronic Illnesses, &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierCharge05162011.pdf"&gt;an organization he founded&lt;/a&gt; with his father Mark Geier, court documents say. In 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf"&gt;disciplined&lt;/a&gt; Geier for practicing medicine without a license. He’s currently &lt;a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=69704&amp;amp;Format=Table"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; in the HHS employee directory as a senior data analyst, the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geier’s &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/15/journal-replaces-anti-vaccine-paper-retracted-missing-conflicts-number-errors/"&gt;first appearance in Retraction Watch&lt;/a&gt; was in 2017, when &lt;em&gt;Science and Engineering Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, a Springer Nature title, retracted a paper on how conflicts of interest might influence research on the link between vaccines and autism. That paper has been cited 13 times according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-131521"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there’s irony in the retraction of a paper on conflicts of interest for issues with conflicts of interest, the key part of that story is that the journal replaced it with a new version of the paper with an updated conflict of interest statement and changes throughout — and &lt;a href="https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9983-2"&gt;this paper remains intact&lt;/a&gt;. It has been cited seven times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geier was one of 10 authors on that paper, including his father Mark. Coauthors &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/08/27/journal-takes-down-autism-vaccine-paper-pending-investigation/"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/04/journal-makes-it-official-retracting-controversial-autism-vaccine-paper/"&gt;Hooker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/15/study-of-autism-and-vitamin-d-earns-retraction-after-questions-about-reliability/"&gt;Geir Bjorklund&lt;/a&gt; have appeared in Retraction Watch for their own retractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geier’s history with lost papers begins more than a decade earlier, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997206001686"&gt;a 2006 paper&lt;/a&gt; withdrawn before it was even officially published, Brian Deer &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/334/7595/666"&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 — three years before Retraction Watch was founded:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last October, &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity Reviews&lt;/em&gt; published online the draft of a seven page paper by reporting laboratory and clinical tests suggesting that thiomersal, a mercury based preservative once routinely added to most vaccines, was the main culprit for a sharp rise in diagnoses of behavioural disorders. The paper was written by Dr Mark Geier, a self employed American geneticist, and his son David. The pair also reported treating autistic children with a hormone product, leuprorelin acetate, which is sometimes prescribed for precocious puberty. They claimed that the drug produced “very significant overall clinical improvements” with “minimal” adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before &lt;a href="https://briandeer.com/wakefield/geier-mark.pdf"&gt;that draft&lt;/a&gt; was finalized, &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, an Elsevier title, withdrew the paper with no specific reason listed. (We’ve criticized Elsevier’s practices for withdrawals, which seem to violate Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines, &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/02/25/is-an-article-in-press-published-a-word-about-elseviers-withdrawal-policy/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.) Deer reported that autism activist Kathleen Seidel had sent a letter to the journal’s editor in chief and entire editorial board detailing issues with the work, including an institutional review board that included the Geiers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/medical-studies-rfk-nih-replication"&gt;prioritize replicating medical research&lt;/a&gt;, Axios and others have reported, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggesting in his confirmation hearing that at least 20 percent of the NIH budget should go toward replication efforts. But studies of a link between vaccines and autism diagnoses have failed to find a connection time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have already done that many times over. It wastes valuable resources to revisit the same question instead of using them to address critical health challenges,” David Higgins, a practicing pediatrician and health services researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, told Axios. “Reexamining settled questions that have already been repeated, replicated, and tested many times is not healthy skepticism; it’s cynicism and science denial.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  Only a handful of rabies cases tied to organ transplantation have ever been reported in the U.S.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A normally life-saving procedure has ended in a incredibly rare kind of death. According to local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a person recently died from a rabies infection contracted from the kidney of a deceased donor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WTOL, a media outlet based in Toledo, Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.wtol.com/article/news/local/michigan-resident-who-received-kidney-transplant-in-lucas-county-died-of-rabies-from-infected-organ-first-mich-death-since-2009/512-b9e08ef7-9c12-4014-bce5-81c0d1f5d6fa"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the unusual death Wednesday, which was confirmed by health officials in Michigan and Ohio, as well as the CDC. Officials say that no one else is at risk of rabies from the tainted procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The cause of death is rabies and complications,” Carl Schmidt, a deputy coroner with the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, told WTOL. “The diagnosis was confirmed by sending tissue to the CDC.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies"&gt;Rabies&lt;/a&gt; is a virus that can infect the brain and spinal cord of most any mammal. It’s infamous for being a practical death sentence once the infected starts to show signs of illness, such as aggression, disorientation, and a strong fear of water. Symptoms can take weeks to appear in humans, however, and death can almost always be prevented if someone gets timely treatment before this happens. Post-exposure prophylaxis is a combination of the rabies vaccine and donated antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The virus typically spreads through the saliva of infected animals, often from scratches or bites. Widespread vaccination programs in pets and improved animal control have made rabies a rare occurrence in much of the world, with fewer than 10 deaths reported annually in the U.S. But Americans do still sometimes catch rabies, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/california-teacher-dies-from-rare-rabies-infection-after-bat-encounter-in-classroom-2000532968"&gt;usually from bats&lt;/a&gt; or other infected wildlife. Even rarer is a fatal case of rabies transmitted via transplantation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last such widely reported death in the U.S. appears to have &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2013/s0315_rabies_organs.html"&gt;occurred in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, involving a Maryland resident (other people who received organs from the deceased donor were given post-exposure prophylaxis). In 2004, a cluster of four deaths in Texas was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043018"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to a single decreased donor. Transplantation-related rabies is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6000923/"&gt;bigger problem&lt;/a&gt; in China, where rabies is more commonly reported in general, but still very rare.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Donors and their organs are routinely tested for potentially serious infections or other diseases that could be transmitted to a recipient. But in its investigation of the 2013 case, the CDC noted that donors typically &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2013/s0315_rabies_organs.html#:~:text=If%20rabies%20is%20not%20clinically%20suspected%2C%20laboratory%20testing%20for%20rabies%20is%20not%20routinely%20performed%2C%20as%20it%20is%20difficult%20for%20doctors%20to%20confirm%20results%20in%20the%20short%20window%20of%20time%20they%20have%20to%20keep%20the%20organs%20viable%20for%20the%20recipient."&gt;aren’t tested&lt;/a&gt; for rabies if they’re not suspected to have it. In the earlier U.S. cases, neither deceased donor was initially believed to have been killed by rabies (in retrospect, they probably were).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recipient in this latest case received their transplant in late December 2024, and died from their infection in January 2025. Though the person underwent their operation in Ohio, they lived in Michigan, making this the first human case of rabies documented in the latter state since 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials have conducted an investigation into the matter and determined there’s no further risk of rabies from the exposure. The University of Toledo Medical Center, where the procedure was performed, has also said that no glaring issues with how the transplant was carried out were identified.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The health system has worked closely with public health authorities and has conducted a thorough review of this case, which found all best practices and standard safety protocols were appropriately followed,” the Center said in a statement provided to WTOL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, this appears to be an extremely rare, but nonetheless tragic freak occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                                        Canada's most populous province is fighting a measles outbreak even bigger than the one in Texas and New Mexico. Public Health Ontario said Thursday that more than 100 new cases were reported in the last week, bringing the total of confirmed and probable cases reported since October to 572, reports &lt;a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/2025/03/27/ontario-measles-case-count-hits-572-up-by-more-than-100-in-past-week/"&gt;CP24&lt;/a&gt;. The sharp rise is "due to continued exposures and transmission among individuals who have not been immunized," the health agency said. Dozens more cases have been reported in other provinces, making the outbreak the country's largest since 2011. No deaths have been reported but authorities in Ontario say 42 measles patients, most of them unvaccinated children, have been hospitalized, including two in intensive care.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        As in the Texas and New Mexico outbreak, many measles patients in Canada are from Mennonite communities. "Cases could spread in any unvaccinated community or population but are disproportionately affecting some Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities due to a combination of under-immunization and exposure to measles in certain areas," Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief health officer, wrote to provincial health units earlier this month, per &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11095201/measles-outbreak-ontario-mennonite-communities-new-brunswick/"&gt;Global News&lt;/a&gt;. He said the Ontario outbreak had been traced "back to an exposure at a large gathering with guests from Mennonite communities in New Brunswick last fall."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Marlene Epp, who directed the Mennonite studies program at the University of Waterloo, tells the &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-on-the-ground-in-the-epicentre-of-ontarios-measles-outbreak/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the church doesn't ban vaccination, but the community has a long history of rejecting what it considers to be government meddling, and vaccine mandates during the pandemic increased skepticism about vaccines in general. "There's a whole set of protocols that emerged in COVID that were highly problematic for conservative Mennonite communities," Epp says, especially the closing of churches, schools, and church-related social gatherings.

Much as she has many times across continents, she indulged in street food - a banh mi sandwich. A few days later she ate a grilled lobster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rhian said: ‘I started having stomach pains, which I never have… It kept me up all night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The context is, I’ve never had a bad stomach in my life. Even when I have food poisoning, it goes so quickly.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She endured &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13074473/Ulcerative-colitis-revealed-Louise-Thompson.html"&gt;a range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; for about four months – severe fatigue, blood in her stool, recurring fevers, and constant bloating. It wasn’t until the new year that she decided she could no longer avoid the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the doctor, where testing revealed she had developed ulcerative colitis (UC) in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine and rectum. UC, an &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13500969/Major-cause-inflammatory-bowel-disease-symptoms-treat-it.html"&gt;autoimmune condition&lt;/a&gt;, occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the colon, leading to ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are still unclear about what exactly causes UC, but they are confident that it results from the body’s attack on itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Rhian does not regret her trip or what she ate, telling her thousands of &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellaaa_rhian"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers: ‘I was traveling 10 years prior to that, I’ve been to multiple countries, I’ve eaten street food… I don’t regret anything. It hasn’t put me off traveling.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rhian has been in remission from UC for six months, meaning the inflammation in her colon is under control, her stomach pains have gone away, and she no longer has blood in her stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellaaa_rhian/video/7483833849382833430"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a TikTok: ‘With the help of medicine and also good diet and looking after myself, I feel so much better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep her UC manageable, Ms Rhian fills her diet with anti-inflammatory foods, including leafy greens, ginger and turmeric juice, green tea and black tea, bone broth, and ginger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also avoids gluten, which triggers an immune response that causes inflammation in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before traveling to Vietnam, she didn’t have to think about her diet at such a granular level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she has traveled to dozens of countries and, while she has had food poisoning linked to street food, nothing like this had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she noted she has a predisposition to autoimmune conditions and believes the food poisoning awakened UC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food poisoning does not cause UC, but it can be an activating trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections caused by bacteria such as salmonella and E. Coli can damage the lining of the intestines, allowing that bacteria to invade the gut wall, thus exposing the immune system to a barrage of harmful bacteria that spurs the immune system into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food poisoning can also throw the gut microbiome - balance of healthy bacteria in the body - out of balance. The gut is naturally populated with beneficial bacteria, but when invaded by the types that cause harm, the protective bacteria die out while the harmful ones replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are still unclear about what exactly causes UC, but they are confident it results from the body’s attack on itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics also come into play. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation estimates that up to 30 percent of people with a close family member will develop the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Ms Rhian does not have a history of UC in her family, she can still carry the genes that trigger it. Irritable bowel diseases such as UC involve hundreds of gene variants, each contributing to some risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Irritable bowel diseases are common in the US, with one estimate showing an estimated one in 100 has one. UC specifically affects more than 1.2 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her family members may also have genes that increase the risk of developing the condition but they've never been activated by outside triggers, such as food poisoning, taking antibiotics, eating too little fiber and too many processed foods, and an imbalance of gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Members of her family have been stricken with colorectal cancer in middle age, however, ‘so it was really key for me to get the message out that blood in your stool is not normal and to see a doctor,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/millennial-food-triggered-disease-no-cure-2047675"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She chalks the ordeal up to bad luck, telling her thousands of followers that, given her globe-trotting, adventurous appetite, and genetic makeup, ‘it was going to happen at some point in my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Don’t avoid traveling,’ she said. ‘It didn’t put me off anything. I went to Costa Rica in December. It obviously makes it a little more tricky with my symptoms… but I’m ok.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:47:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQMmhLQWJMcHhYNmZma2dvWmswdlRqNk5kNW5IT0ZOQWFwSVdYeGpzd2ZpM0p1T3p3U0dPVkRQVmFwUnNXZW9NSTBkVXloQnN3WTN3bEJ4WW9VRFpPNUlMZ2dYQ3V6RlZoSFFLMjc4UUNaMHpxVTBRNHVHbjVZTGlBOTA4d3NqNHpRdEtnT0U0dVhlcUZRRzVyN3BZOHFyVS1EcHdYWFMwb9IBrAFBVV95cUxPX21TaHQ2N0kxNnU0MEVTQURuaXJMaG8wTXNqYWY3WDJuc05OUy1salEwWXBuc3ZUcnNKc0N4ZmtBN0tIUkNNQ2NSSHU1cEFtQ0pzRmhlbDhVY3NIWnNaX3kxcTRhR0l1U25YWnczQ2dpQldlZEtiVndUa0dzdTRKckJ6UDdQc3Q0dTlRdGhDdE9jdWlzSVNuSThJMmJJempVQ1FqdWZPVjVQOVNO</guid></item><item><title>Cyanide plays a major role in the human body, study reveals - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5lbXZWYTVJTzVUSWg4RDk4TjNkcHNSTzgtUEtUV0VMM3RCdTZpZjY0Vk5mR0tHOVppQkV3cnRiZmtQMU5kQmxRTXozZHNqTXM5VzFJVVlJOUFNVUZaM1BwSTZKXzFZRGstbmZUdGluMnJFeUpzQTNydFZLTm1aTFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyanide is a highly lethal chemical that has been used in warfare and poisonings for centuries—that was the general consensus on the naturally occurring chemical up until spring 2025. But in a global study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01225-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, a research team from seven countries and 12 universities, including South Dakota State University, has upended the world's consensus on cyanide. The researchers have found that while cyanide remains highly poisonous, it also plays a fundamental role in normal cell function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Brian Logue, professor and head of SDSU's Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physics, is one of the country's leading experts on cyanide. Logue and Moustafa Khalaf, an SDSU research scientist, played a critical role in the research process by confirming and quantifying cyanide production in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The identification of endogenous cyanide production in mammals represents a significant advancement in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+biology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell biology&lt;/a&gt; and metabolism," Logue said. "This research highlights the dual nature of cyanide, acting as both a toxin at high concentrations and a crucial signaling molecule at low concentrations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A naturally produced poison?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, scientists had only known cyanide to be naturally produced in certain types of bacteria and plants. The process of producing cyanide in minute quantities had never been demonstrated in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through experiments on mice and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt;, the research team, led by scientists from Switzerland, observed that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hydrogen+cyanide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hydrogen cyanide&lt;/a&gt; was consistently present in the cells and organisms. This was supported by the detection of cyanide in the liver of mice and humans as well as in the bloodstream. The chemical, they found, was produced naturally, suggesting a role in fundamental physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Khalaf, cyanide's natural production in the body is linked to glycine, an amino acid, which stimulates its production in the liver cells. The research team was able to determine this interaction by adding glycine to cell cultures. By adding glycine, the production of hydrogen cyanide increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, cyanide is highly lethal and is toxic at certain doses. How does the human body regulate internal cyanide levels to prevent toxicity?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzyme, rhodanese, plays a critical role in toxicity prevention. It converts hydrogen cyanide into thiocyanates, nontoxic salts, which are eliminated from the body, Khalaf explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Echoing the principle of Paracelsus, the research indicates that the dose determines whether cyanide acts as a poison or has beneficial effects," Khalaf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logue and Khalaf confirmed and quantified the cyanide production in the cells by using their novel technique and patented technology, the Cyanalyzer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Potential therapeutic benefits and applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery has far-reaching potential therapeutic benefits and applications, many of which are in the medical field. Experiments conducted during this study showed low concentrations of hydrogen cyanide enhance cell survival during oxygen deprivation. This suggests cyanide plays a role in the body's protective mechanisms against conditions like stroke, Khalaf noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The discovery of cyanide's protective effects during hypoxia presents potential therapeutic strategies for stroke by enhancing brain cell resilience to oxygen shortage," Khalaf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings show that certain diseases—nonketotic hyperglycinemia being one—cause the body to produce excessive amounts of hydrogen cyanide. The rare disease causes glycine to build up in tissues and organs. It is most damaging to babies as excessive glycine can build up in the brain, leading to neurological disorders. Previously, there was almost no treatment for this disease, but this research, with fresh insight into glycine and rhodanese, may lead to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead author in the study, Csaba Szabo, believes these findings will "fundamentally change the way we think about cell biology and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on further understanding the precise roles of endogenous cyanide in health and disease, exploring its therapeutic potential while carefully managing its toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee makes the world go round. For millions of people out there, there’s no morning without coffee. But not all cups are created equal. There’s the espresso, the French press, the bottomless pot, and a bunch of other types of coffee. According to a new study, some of those are worse for your health than others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that coffee brewed in common workplace machines — especially those using metal filters — contains significantly higher levels of the cholesterol-raising compounds cafestol and kahweol than paper-filtered coffee. In other words, if you care about cholesterol, filtered coffee may just be the healthiest option out there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It’s not the bean, it’s how you make it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a complex beverage. It’s packed with biologically active compounds. Some are protective — like antioxidants. Others are energizing — like caffeine. But two molecules in particular, cafestol and kahweol, carry a darker side. These oily substances can raise LDL cholesterol, the kind that builds up in arteries and contributes to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the catch: cafestol and kahweol aren’t removed by roasting, grinding, or bean selection. They’re in all coffee. But whether they end up in your cup depends entirely on the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We studied fourteen coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers. From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee. Obviously, not all coffee machines manage to filter them out. But the problem varies between different types of coffee machines, and the concentrations also showed large variations over time,” says David Iggman, researcher at Uppsala University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper filters — like those used in drip &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/reviews/buying-guide/best-smart-coffee-machines/"&gt;coffee makers&lt;/a&gt; — trap most of these compounds. But brewing methods without a fine filter let them slip through. That includes French press, espresso, boiled coffee, and many workplace machines. Simply put, any type of coffee that doesn’t include a filter is likely adding cholesterol to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-filtered-coffee-is-a-quiet-hero"&gt;Filtered coffee is a quiet hero&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Filtered coffee is usually not the most popular choice. Even people who do drink filtered coffee don’t usually think about filters beyond whether they’re biodegradable or fit their machine. But these filters act like tiny health guardians. They trap &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; (a class of compounds that includes cafestol and kahweol) before they can enter your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even makeshift filters — like a double-layered polyester sock — proved effective in the lab. It’s not the sophistication of the machine that matters. It’s the presence of a fine enough barrier. The type of bean also didn’t seem to matter much. The difference is how you make your coffee, not what the coffee is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one reason why the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations now specifically endorse filtered coffee over unfiltered. Nordic countries love their coffee and opting for filtered was considered a &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1965" href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/your-gas-stove-is-more-dangerous-than-you-think-heres-why/"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; move, not a flavor crusade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coffees from brewing machines — common in hospitals and offices — contained up to 444 mg/L of cafestol. In contrast, paper-filtered coffee came in at just 12 mg/L. That’s more than a 35-fold difference. Espresso was even worse in some cases, with one sample topping 2,400 mg/L. Some espresso samples in the study had moderate diterpene levels. Others were off the charts. The variation likely comes down to differences in pressure, temperature, grind size, and machine cleanliness. But because espresso doesn’t use a paper filter, the risks remain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What this all means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran simulations based on average coffee consumption — about three cups per workday. Over time, switching from high-diterpene machine coffee to filtered drip coffee could reduce LDL cholesterol by 0.58 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might sound minor. But over the course of 5 years, this translates to a 13% reduction in heart disease risk, thanks to less plaque buildup in arteries​; over 40 years, it’s a 36% reduction, the researchers note. In public health terms, that’s a massive gain from a modest change. It’s like adding full-fat cream to each cup of filtered coffee. You might not taste it, but your heart notices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also explain some of the uncertainty regarding the health effects of coffee. Over the decades, science has struggled to make sense of coffee’s health effects, even though coffee is among the most studied beverages on Earth. One study &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/coffee-health-benefits-longevity/"&gt;says it’s good&lt;/a&gt; for your brain. Another links it to longer life. But then come warnings about cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even heart disease. For every headline declaring coffee a superfood, another whispers caution. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/27/18/1983/6125539"&gt;A part of this could be explained&lt;/a&gt; by how coffee is made; as researchers showed, even the same type of coffee (ie an espresso) can sometimes have very different cholesterol values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease. For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it’s clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable,” says Iggman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to make a healthy coffee&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way you make your coffee matters — a lot more than most people realize. A simple paper filter can intercept cholesterol-raising compounds and potentially lower your long-term &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1964" href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/staying-fit-heart-attack-16012019/"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and wondering whether you should switch to filtered coffee, the answer is probably ‘yes’. This isn’t the first study to come up with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-healthiest-way-to-brew-coffee"&gt;this conclusion&lt;/a&gt; and there seem to be only upsides to filtered coffee. Filtered coffee continues to show health benefits—or at least neutrality. Unfiltered coffee, on the other hand, is consistently linked to &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/unfiltered-coffee-may-be-increasing-your-ldl-cholesterol"&gt;higher cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and, in long-term studies, increased heart disease and mortality​.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this should be fairly easy and inexpensive to do. Here are some basic tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew coffee using paper filters, either in a drip machine or pour-over.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid regular use of metal-filtered methods like French press, moka pot, or percolator.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be cautious with espresso, especially in high quantities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At work, find out what kind of machine you’re using. If it’s a metal-filtered brewing system, consider alternatives — or bring your own filtered brew.&lt;/li&gt;

rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&lt;/a&gt; levels in the blood could offer men earlier access to treatment, improving their chances of a cure and reducing the need for expensive treatments linked to advanced-stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term data consistently show that PSA screening can lower the risk of dying from prostate cancer by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new research, from the world’s largest prostate cancer screening study, however, researchers looked at 20 years of data to see how often saying no to prostate cancer screening affects the chances of dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on 20 years of data from over 160,000 men across seven European countries, the study highlighted a high-risk group often overlooked in national screening efforts: appointment avoiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study’s findings showed that over 12,400 people skipped their prostate screening appointments, leading to a 45% higher risk of

class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing not to take part in screening may stem from a complex combination of factors, according to the study’s lead author, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renee-Leenen-2" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renee-Leenen-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener

Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.erspc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;The European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (ERSPC) was initiated in the early 1990s to assess the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening on prostate cancer (PCa) mortality at a population level. In this secondary analysis, we aimed to get insight into the risk of dying of PCa in screening non-attenders using long-term data from the ERSPC,” Leenen told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the ERSPC, men were randomized to either a screening arm (invited for screening/PSA test) or control arm (not offered screening/PSA test),” Leenen continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of the 72,460 men randomized to the SA, 12,401 (17%) did not attend any of the screening rounds offered. We found that men who were offered screening (randomised to the screening arm) but did not attend population-based screening (screening arm non-attenders) are at 39% higher risk of dying from PCa compared to men that were not offered screening (in the control arm).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Renée Leenen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a consequence, non-attendance may be the biggest counteracting factor to the successful implementation of population-based screening programs for (prostate) cancer,” Leenen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nilesh Vora, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified hematologist and medical oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, not involved in this research, described these new findings as “fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower death risk by attending screenings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has long been controversy over whether PSA screening is helpful in a disease that we’ve long labeled as ‘one that most patients will die with, rather than die from,’ but this study seems to suggest a 23% decrease in mortality specifically from prostate cancer in men who engage in screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Nilesh Vora, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The age of the population at hand — 55-69 represents one that are candidates for aggressive treatments if prostate cancer is found and thus, should be the target for prostate cancer screening in future studies that could validate this trial,” Vora noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although these results are yet to be peer-reviewed, Vora is looking forward to the full results being published later this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For any screening program to be effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 70% of the population needs to be exposed to the screening test,” Leenen pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, current cancer screening programs low and declining participation rates,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-attendance may also be one of the biggest counteracting factors when it comes to successful screening for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that men who were offered screening but did not attend population-based screening are at higher risk of dying from PCa compared to men that were not offered screening. Consequently, non-attendance may be the biggest counteracting factor to the successful implementation of population-based screening programmes for (prostate) cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Renée Leenen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hence, there is an urgent need for further qualitative research to explore screening non-attenders and understand why, although being offered screening, they opted not to attend population-based screening,” Leenen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could inform tailored intervention to address awareness, informed participation and inequalities in access,” Dr. Leened added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force discouraged people from undergoing prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening due to overteratment and overdiagnosis from the years before.

We know that the reduction in prostate cancer screening during that time period led to prostate cancer getting diagnosed at higher grades and stages,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this updated, ERSPC study, the take-home point is that the over 12,000 men who effectively did not follow any recommended screening guidelines, had a nearly a 40% higher risk of death related to prostate cancer. The study reinforces the fact that prostate cancer screening reduces the risk of dying from prostate cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ramkishen Narayanan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is still left up to interpretation is the best practical application of PSA screening for the average man. The urologic community in the United States has adopted a shared decision-making pathway with patients about prostate cancer screening, namely, allowing patients to feel empowered to start and stop PSA screening with the guidance of their trusted physician,” Narayanan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you shouldn’t skip a screening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prostate cancer screening trials and population-based screening programs/events were utilized in the U.S. in the past but fell out of favor due to the undisciplined management of results and subsequent treatment. In the contemporary era, where patients are more informed to the point of being inundated with recommendations, I believe the study here sends a clear signal through the noise — ignoring prostate cancer screening will significantly increase a man’s risk of dying from prostate cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ramkishen Narayanan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:30:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxORkJ3blhKWXZfcUZ3OFR1by1iVG1ydkVqOXRfTXFOZVNObTZxaUw4MlZWa0ZFMDdBdGZjSm9Tbnd5amo4dGItckM4RHo5ZGlNWC02bm9vdXZsR1BnTFVHUl95aTdfSlZNa092LUVqYUxBUnpNazd3bXJ2TEJyMUl1eVJHVm8yb25JYVQtRkEtMkpOZw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists find drug that makes human blood poisonous to mosquitos - Euronews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxNMU5FZERZQk1TNzgxZ3lIN1BYYnBSTXJHRkhUX1hBcHhKQmJxYzlfYjFfdHBYVjhNb0x6d2k4ZWlDaEV2MjFkSWZtRkVxSFZCYTR0VWNkMzJkSGtMWHdkVzNFN0tBaDJtSF8tdUozQk5MckZid2JmbUZTSC1FT1daaHhDTG1QX0tOUlNhbk1ZMUNzck5McjI3eV8tU2FaSGwxaFdWMkx1WEIzd1ZMRHJuM0RoUXF1UlV2blM3SUZiMDZsX2YwWXZPejMtclRuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-summary"&gt;
        "One way to stop the spread of diseases transmitted by insects is to make the blood of animals and humans toxic," according to researchers.

However, its repeated use can lead to drug-resistance. It can also be toxic for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nitisinone performance was fantastic," said Álvaro Acosta Serrano, professor of biological sciences at Notre Dame and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has a much longer half-life in human blood than ivermectin, which means its mosquitocidal activity remains circulating in the human body for much longer. This is critical when applied in the field for safety and economical reasons," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitisinone was able to kill mosquitoes across all age groups, including older mosquitoes that are most likely to transmit malaria. It was also capable of eliminating insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the future, it could be advantageous to alternate both nitisinone and ivermectin for mosquito control," Haines said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, nitisinone could be employed in areas where ivermectin resistance persists or where ivermectin is already heavily used for livestock and humans".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito-borne diseases include malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, chikungunya and yellow fever, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They represent an emerging threat to human health in Europe with climate change creating more favourable conditions for invasive mosquito species despite malaria being eradicated from the continent for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:13:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxNMU5FZERZQk1TNzgxZ3lIN1BYYnBSTXJHRkhUX1hBcHhKQmJxYzlfYjFfdHBYVjhNb0x6d2k4ZWlDaEV2MjFkSWZtRkVxSFZCYTR0VWNkMzJkSGtMWHdkVzNFN0tBaDJtSF8tdUozQk5MckZid2JmbUZTSC1FT1daaHhDTG1QX0tOUlNhbk1ZMUNzck5McjI3eV8tU2FaSGwxaFdWMkx1WEIzd1ZMRHJuM0RoUXF1UlV2blM3SUZiMDZsX2YwWXZPejMtclRuQQ</guid></item><item><title>Can Triathlon Training Turn Back the Clock on Your Biological Age? - Triathlete</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPNDRnMzVqNUpQSV9pdXg0TEh1VTFFc3cyc1c0MjZRbHpmSXlpU0JGVDdObFdYUW9meWRRd0RwejV1SXNjcXBuTlBzT0JWeEtBZmhoeFBybS1aSDRCSXQyaDBPRFhIOFh1Zm9GNFhVT1pKQk9LMG9PdWcwaEhFLUxzZm91My14RTZBU1p3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-rte-text u-spacing--and-half c-content__post js-fitvids js-article-body " data-inject-ads data-inject-ads-options="{ &amp;quot;markup&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;&amp;lt;div class='js-ad js-hide-elements js-visible-signed-out o-ad c-ad--inline' data-child-zone='in-content-leaderboard-tri' data-size='[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[300,50],[300,100],[728,90],[320,50],[320,100],[468,60],[300,250],[1,1]]' data-size-map='[[[1145,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[728,90],[468,60],[1,1]]],[[850,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[468,60],[1,1]]],[[0,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[300,250],[320,100],[300,100],[320,50],[300,50],[1,1]]]]' data-hide-elements='.o-banner-ad__vertical .js-ad'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;quot;], &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;nextExceptions&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;img, blockquote, div&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nextContainsExceptions&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;img, blockquote, a.btn, a.o-button&amp;quot;} }"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Netflix documentary &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81757532" data-afl-p="0"&gt;“Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever”&lt;/a&gt; follows the story of Bryan Johnson, a 47-year-old man who has devoted his time, energy, and sizable wealth to the pursuit of anti-aging. To date, Johnson claims to have achieved “perfect biomarkers” and reversed his biological age by five years. Make no mistake – this is no whimsical Peter Pan story, but a pseudoscientific quest to turn back one’s biological clock through a rigorous fasting routine, supplements, experimental treatments, and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how much exercise does it take to reverse your biological age? Surprisingly little, according to Johnson. In the documentary, Johnson references a daily 45-60 minute routine of 25 exercises plus brief HIIT, which he describes in more detail on his YouTube channel. Throw in an occasional hike or two, and the exercise box is checked for anti-aging (you will, of course, need to spend many more hours and dollars to check the other boxes in Johnson’s &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/?_ab=0&amp;amp;_fd=0&amp;amp;_sc=1" data-afl-p="0"&gt;“Don’t Die Protocol”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For endurance athletes in the thick of training, six hours of exercise per week might feel a little light, and triathletes are notoriously aversive to strength training, preferring to spend their time in steady Zone 2 efforts. But many get into endurance sports to get healthy, live longer, and feel younger. It begs the question: If a little exercise is good for anti-aging, is a lot better? We asked Laura Kunces, vice president of medical strategy at &lt;a href="https://www.thorne.com/who-we-are" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt; to break down what endurance athletes need to know about how training affects biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time that has elapsed since the day you were born is your chronological age – in other words, the age that aligns with what’s on your birth certificate or driver’s license. From a health and medical standpoint, chronological age is helpful in understanding whether a symptom or issue is typical or atypical for the person experiencing it. Changes to vision in a 20-year-old might be alarming; in a 50-year-old, it might simply signal a common age-related condition known as presbyopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological age is different, says Kunces: “Your biological age is how your cells are looking from an age standpoint. As we age chronologically, oftentimes we also age biologically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t always happen at the same rate. Your cells may look or act younger or older than your chronological age in response to diet or lifestyle. This might also be visible without a blood sample or microscope – if you’ve ever met an 80-year-old triathlete who moves with the energy and alertness of a 50-year-old, that’s biological aging in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to quantify your biological age, multiple tests are available – usually through &lt;a href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/at-home-health-tests-reviewed/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;blood analysis like Function Health or Thorne&lt;/a&gt; – to give you a number that shows what your biological age is relative to chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is my biological age? Measurement methods explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Biological age is a buzzy term out there, and different people have different tests and different ways to look at it,” Kunces says. There is no one widely-accepted measurement tool for biological age, perhaps because the science is new, having been first introduced in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4015143/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;scientific paper in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for measuring biological age, and the tests that do exist are best-guess models. Some ways tests measure biological age include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Telomere length, or DNA structures at the end of chromosomes that shorten as a person ages; longer telomere length may indicate a longer lifespan, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242319300034?via%3Dihub" data-afl-p="0"&gt;according to some studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;A variety of biomarkers to calculate biological age. Researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12849085/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;have identified 16 biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; that could be used in calculating biological age,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Others have come up with their own way of testing. Thorne, for example, uses what Kunces calls “an extremely large database of blood biomarkers from individuals of all ages, all lifestyles, all backgrounds, all ethnicities” and a “&lt;a href="https://www.thorne.com/take-5-daily/article/how-does-thornes-biological-age-test-work" data-afl-p="0"&gt;complex algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to help understand how you compare to other people from a clinical biomarker standpoint.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Artificial intelligence is also identifying new ways to measure biological age in &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-enabled-ekgs-find-difference-between-numerical-age-and-biological-age-significantly-affects-health-longevity/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;health tests like EKGs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/are-you-aging-faster-than-you-should-new-ai-reveals-your-true-biological-age-from-5-drops-of-blood/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;hormone metabolism pathways in the blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What factors affect biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there’s no way to avoid aging altogether, there are some consistent factors that contribute to the speed at which we age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diet: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8754996/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; a person’s diet might be the biggest factor in determining how fast (or slow) a person ages. Though no one specific proven “biological aging diet” exists, experts mostly agree it’s a good idea to get a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daily habits: &lt;/b&gt;What you do each day may accelerate (or decelerate) biological aging. Studies have found factors, including exercise, smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" data-afl-p="0"&gt;living conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10650967/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;social relationships&lt;/a&gt; can affect the way we age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does endurance training affect biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_496508" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-lazy-load fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-496508" data-src="https://cdn.triathlete.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2416a22d-87df-46eb-adc6-48bcc84ac412.jpg?width=730" alt="Triathletes with their diversity of training might have a good matrix for a lower biological age. But it requires attention to strength training, rest and recovery - something athletes in our sport are notoriously bad at."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption "&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Triathlon training can present a good wellness matrix for a lower biological age. But it requires attention to strength training, rest, and recovery – something athletes in our sport are notoriously bad at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good for the body, in more ways than one. &lt;a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/16726/text/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Physical activity has been found to affect telomere length&lt;/a&gt; (one marker of biological age) for the better, and &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" data-afl-p="0"&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt; show exercise habits in general are a good predictor of longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, yes, of course, exercise is going to help you live longer,” Kunces says. “But there are so many nuances to that, though, because amount, volume, duration, and intensity play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triathletes, who by nature of their chosen sport, get a good variety of workouts in a given week with swims, bikes, and runs of varying lengths and intensities. Kunces says that’s a “good situation,” but also warns triathletes against falling into the trap of believing more is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Triathletes might start to see things change in their biological age or biomarkers when they’re either overdoing it or under-recovering,” says Kunces. “Not giving the body a chance to recover from the exercise you’re doing could put unnecessary stress on the body and increase inflammation, which will ultimately change the structure and function of a lot of these cells that you’re looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, exercise will often improve certain hormone levels in the body, improving biological age. But too much – whether in duration, intensity, or frequency – &lt;a href="https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/153-autumn-24/features/overtraining-and-the-endocrine-system-can-hormones-indicate-overtraining/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;can cause hormone levels to go haywire&lt;/a&gt;, leading to accelerated aging (For more on this, &lt;a href="https://www.triathlete.com/training/the-endocrine-system-is-every-triathletes-best-friend-or-worst-enemy/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;read Jill Colangelo’s breakdown of how overtraining affects the endocrine system and HPA axis&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kunces says training for and racing longer-distance triathlon events might also affect other biomarkers measured in biological age tests: “In longer-length triathlons, you might start to see changes with iron and things like that. There is such a thing as sports anemia, where you’re crushing red blood cells and there might be higher turnover of certain red blood cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Johnson might be onto something with his less-is-more approach to exercise, but even Ironman triathletes can likely see their biological age go down, so long as they ensure proper recovery. Remember, multiple factors affect biological age, including diet, sleep, and stress. Taking a holistic approach to training with appropriate nutrition and recovery methods can mitigate the effects of endurance training on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery aspect is where Kunces sees the biggest benefit of biological aging tests for athletes: “It is just a way to gauge how things are going; I’ve been training for an Ironman over the last four months. What’s going on with my blood? Should I be doing this differently, do I need to change my diet? Just making sure an athlete is getting enough sleep and recovery can influence some of these biomarkers. We know that inflammation can be more exuberant with less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other big example is nutrition. Especially in the endurance community, you’re consuming a lot of carbohydrates. So making sure that the amount you’re consuming, the timing, and quality of those is appropriate for you, because if not, you’re going to see changes in how you’ve been metabolizing those carbohydrates over time. It’s a way to see if what you’re doing is working for you, and if not, what you should be changing to make sure you’re getting the right stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can endurance athletes reverse biological aging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of anti-aging is full of silver bullets and supplements, and it’s important to note that as of this writing, none have been definitively proven to reduce biological age. Studies show many common supplements &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2/full" data-afl-p="0"&gt;have no effect on life expectancy (and may even increase mortality risk)&lt;/a&gt;, and though some &lt;a href="https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/5138" data-afl-p="0"&gt;already-established medications show promise in anti-aging applications&lt;/a&gt; for some populations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any for anti-aging use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why it’s so hard to find a singular fountain of youth is the same reason why different testing companies use different biomarkers for calculating biological age – there is no one singular hallmark of aging, but a cascade of changes across different systems, affected by each individual’s genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Because there’s no one way to age, there’s no one way to anti-age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to find your way, do you really need to spend $2 million per year on anti-aging protocols to address them all, as Johnson has? Not quite. Though longevity science is still very much a work in progress, experts generally agree most people can simply focus on the fundamentals if they want to have a longer, healthier lifespan: eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and find ways to manage your physical and emotional stress.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Dr. Sofiya Milman spends her days studying some of the longest-living people on the planet — humans who are living proof that it's possible to live decades past the average American lifespan of 75 to 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she's learned so far — about lifestyle but particularly about DNA — is opening up avenues that could lead to a new era of antiaging treatments for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have people who live to 100 and are healthy, so our bodies are capable. It's biologically plausible, therefore we just have to tweak things to get us there," she told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman, the director of human longevity studies at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is leading a study to recruit 10,000 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;age 95 and older, along with their relatives, to find out what makes them live longer and healthier lives than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "super-agers" may owe their long lives to luck and good genes, but studying them could help scientists give the rest of us a biological edge, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then we can have a drug that will benefit the other 99.9% of the population that didn't win the genetic lottery and wasn't lucky enough to inherit that gene," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, don't get sidetracked by common misconceptions about living longer. Here's what Milman said really works (and doesn't) for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0" data-toc-id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging isn't inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can't control the passage of time, medications and treatments could help us delay, prevent, or even reverse the process of getting older, at least in the sense of becoming frail or ill over time, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People do not recognize the fact that there is a biology that drives aging and that you can actually manipulate that biology," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have medications to treat conditions including high blood pressure and high cholesterol — some of them, such as statins, have &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-tricks-longevity-expert-reduced-longevity-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;antiaging benefits&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors may one day have even more treatments for age-related decline, and sooner than you may think. Milman is hopeful that we'll start to see viable options in the next decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really not science fiction anymore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8" data-toc-id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthspan is more important than lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 65, a majority of Americans have at least one chronic illness such as arthritis, diabetes, cognitive decline, or cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;No one wants to live to 100 if they can't get out of bed or engage with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think most people would argue the more important thing here is healthspan. How many years of healthy life free of chronic conditions do you have?" Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super-agers are a perfect example of an &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-doctor-reversed-biological-age-15-years-eats-avoids-mediterranean-2025-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ideal healthspan&lt;/a&gt;, able to stave off dementia, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer for 10 or even 20 years later than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not only living longer, they're actually living healthier," Milman said — and that can hold lessons for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b" data-toc-id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of centenarians drink alcohol and snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, centenarians are just like the rest of the population, even when it comes to unhealthy lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They drink same amount of alcohol, they exercise the same, no less, no more, they're just as likely to be overweight. They're not less likely to smoke. And so there isn't a lifestyle feature that we can say, well, if you do that, then you'll live to be a hundred," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as genetics, and even good luck, seem to play a big role in getting people over the 100-year mark, more than any specific &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/advice-live-longer-centenarians-luck-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;centenarian habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman said studying centenarians had been a poignant reminder to herself about focusing on the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;little habits&lt;/a&gt; that can make a big difference for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the time being, I need to be doing everything that has been shown to help us live longer and healthier, so exercising, eating a healthy diet, reducing stress in my life, and getting enough sleep," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac" data-toc-id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise is really important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you skip your workout or have an extra glass of whiskey, Milman said healthy habits might be even more important if you aren't lucky enough to be naturally long-living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifestyle is important for 99.9% of us who don't have longevity genes. So there's indisputable evidence that leading the healthy lifestyle will allow you to live longer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While science may not guarantee you'll live to 100, you can &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plant-based-mediterranean-diet-add-ten-years-longevity-modeling-study-2022-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; with habits such as eating a diet high in nutrient-dense whole foods including produce, nuts and seeds, and high-quality protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're going to prioritize only one habit for living longer and healthier, it should be exercise, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough physical activity will give you more bang for your buck in terms of health benefits, she said, and the best kind of exercise is one you'll do consistently, whether that's walking with friends or lifting weights in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Maybe it's wise to avoid the office &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;coffee machine&lt;/a&gt; these days — but not because it tastes less than wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A study done in Sweden investigated the levels of certain substances in coffee prepared in workplace coffee machines versus traditional brewing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;that drinking&lt;/a&gt; poorly filtered coffee such as the kind often found in workplace machines could be an overlooked factor in heart health issues due to certain cholesterol concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-conflict-signal-doomed-relationship-couple"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COFFEE CONFLICT COULD SIGNAL 'DOOMED RELATIONSHIP' FOR SPARRING COUPLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substances - cafestol and kahweol - are linked to elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, sometimes called "bad cholesterol"). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of this cholesterol can cause plaque build-up in the arteries and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, stroke and other health problems by narrowing arteries and restricting blood flow, according to the Cleveland Clinic website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poorly filtered coffee, like the kind found in many workplace machines, could increase the risk of heart health issues.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Uppsala University examined 14 different coffee machines in workplaces in Sweden, in collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared the coffee from these machines to coffee produced using home-brewing methods such as paper filters and French presses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-creamer-products-recalled-complaints-spoilage-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE CREAMER PRODUCTS RECALLED AFTER 'COMPLAINTS OF SPOILAGE AND ILLNESS'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal Nutrition, Metabolism &amp;amp; Cardiovascular Diseases, concluded that coffee from most office coffee machines contains high levels of the two cholesterol-elevating substances relative to the amount found in regular drip-filter coffee setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee," a lead researcher said.&lt;/span&gt;

Obviously, not all coffee machines manage to filter them out," lead researcher David Iggman said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the problem varies between different types of coffee machines, and the concentrations also showed large variations over time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/starbucks-ordered-pay-50m-customer-burned-hot-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STARBUCKS ORDERED TO PAY $50M TO CUSTOMER BURNED BY HOT DRINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of high variations between tests from the same coffee machines, a possible factor could be the way cleaning schedules impact how porous the machine's filters are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning a metal filter could wear them down and make them less effective in filtering out certain substances, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machines in the study used five regular brands of ground coffee.

It used to be rare to diagnose a 15-year-old with fatty liver disease, but today it's routine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Modern diets high in processed foods, saturated fats, sugary drinks and red or processed meats, alongside a decline in physical activity, contribute significantly to the rise in fatty liver disease among children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="7bhmk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="89emb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Western diets are overloaded with processed foods and unhealthy fats, while intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains remains low," Ishach-Adiv explains. "It’s not just about what we eat—it’s also about what we don’t do. Kids today move less than ever. A sedentary lifestyle, with excessive screen time and little physical activity, directly impacts energy balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="398eq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although genetics can play a role, it is not the primary cause. "Some cases stem from genetic disorders, but these are rare," she says. Furthermore, even children with normal or low BMI can develop the condition if they have insulin resistance, high blood lipid levels or a genetic predisposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fatty liver disease is often called a "silent disease" because it typically has no noticeable symptoms. "A child or adult can have fatty liver disease without realizing it," Ishach-Adiv says. "It develops quietly and doesn’t cause discomfort until complications arise."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The condition is often detected through routine checkups, particularly in overweight children or those with unexplained symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6uqgk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="45no4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Ultrasounds combined with blood tests can reveal fatty infiltration in the liver. Elevated liver enzymes in blood tests may also signal the disease," she says. "Sometimes, children are diagnosed after being examined for unrelated stomach pain." Early detection is crucial, as lifestyle changes can prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eton8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fatty liver disease isn’t a life sentence — it’s a warning sign. "I tell families that this is an opportunity to make changes before it’s too late," Ishach-Adiv stressed. "It’s a chance to adjust not only the child’s habits but the entire family’s. Many times, siblings and parents also adopt healthier lifestyles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="983th-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The primary treatment isn’t medication but dietary and lifestyle modifications. "Some children with severe obesity or metabolic syndrome may receive weight-loss treatments and there are options for adults. However, the best long-term solution remains a healthy diet and regular physical activity," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4djce-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dietary recommendations include shifting from processed foods to a more natural, Mediterranean-style diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. "Reducing animal fats, avoiding preservatives and artificial colors and prioritizing plant-based fats significantly improve liver function in children," she explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6h017-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The earlier the intervention, the easier it is to maintain healthy habits. "Convincing a 15-year-old to stop drinking chocolate milk and eat healthily is challenging," Dr. Ishach-Adiv says. "But if healthy eating habits are instilled early, they become second nature."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="2r56g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2r56g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2r56g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Our bodies send warning signals—we just need to listen and act before irreversible damage occurs,"  Ishach-Adiv concludes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:54:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9IdlBTeG9wQVZhb2JJTmRFekF2T2N0cm1XN1ByQ01GaGg3bVpLRHpCRVJCa1ZSd3ctd3I5LUViamFLcVJBRHdqQTkxM3FtOHBlbUNveW1HcjRuQmhDMkxMZjAteG52allyZFE</guid></item></channel></rss>
