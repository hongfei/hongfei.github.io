But here's a twist: those "healthy" or "everyday" oils might be slowly damaging your liver and kidneys—especially if they’re overheated, reheated, or used way too often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seed oils: Inflammation rockets hiding in plain sight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From busy kitchens to your everyday dining table, seed oils like soybean, corn, sunflower, and cottonseed are everywhere. They earned a healthy halo early on since they’re plant-based and lower in saturated fat. But &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/54474/html?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;is now giving them a darker side. These oils are heavy in omega-6 fatty acids, which in excess trigger inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver—fuel for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not all. When these oils are overheated or reused—say, in deep-fried snacks or reheated vegetable dishes—they become unstable. They break down and form toxic compounds: aldehydes, lipid peroxides, even polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These oils damage liver cells and stress their DNA repair systems, contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, and potentially liver disease .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that reheating cooking oil can be harmful to your health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reheated oils—A toxic rollercoaster&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all hate food waste, so the temptation to reuse oil is strong. But research on repeatedly heated oils is straight-up alarming. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210326/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in 2021 showed that consuming oil reheated three or more times led to visible damage not just in the liver, but also in the kidneys, pancreas, and gut tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice had elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and even DNA damage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another classic study on cooking fumes found that women exposed to heavy kitchen oil fumes—like those you'd get from working in a fast-food environment—had more than double the risk of developing fatty liver disease compared to those in well-ventilated conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all oils are created equal: Better options&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, not all oils are culprits here. Science now walks us through a hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra‑virgin olive oil: Loaded with monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, this oil lowers liver-fat markers, supports insulin response, and fights oxidative damage. Epidemiological studies link it to better liver and overall mortality outcomes—take that as a green light for salad dressings and low-heat sautéing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado oil: Similar profile to olive oil—healthy fats, high smoke point, good for the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold‑pressed sesame oil: Packed with antioxidants, it supports liver enzymes and reduces inflammation—and even helps kidney health in high-fat diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flaxseed and walnut oils: High in omega-3s—they reduce liver fat and inflammation, though best used raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canola oil (cold‑pressed): Neutral profile and low saturated fat; swapping butter or palm oil for it has been linked to lower mortality .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even virgin coconut oil has its niche—its medium-chain triglycerides may help metabolism when used sparingly. But high consumption can still contribute to fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do: Kitchen wisdom for liver love&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, ditch the heated seed oils for everyday use. That means no more bulk cooking with soybean, sunflower, or corn oil. Swap in olive or avocado oil for cooking, and use flaxseed or walnut oil raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, resist the urge to reuse oil. One batch, maybe two max—if at all. When it’s foggy or smells off, it’s time to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, mind your cooking temperature. Stay below smoke points; steady medium heat is safest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, watch packaged foods. If a processed curry or snack lists "vegetable oil" without clarity, it’s likely a heated seed oil bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, invest in cold-pressed and minimally processed oils—even if they cost a bit more, your liver and kidneys will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swipe that cooking oil smartly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kitchen oils aren’t mere flavor boosters—they’re gatekeepers of organ health. Heated or refined seed oils bring inflammation, free radicals, and liver-kidney stress. Reusing oil compounds that danger exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flip the narrative: use olive, avocado, or sesame oil. Watch temperature. Avoid reheating. Those simple steps protect vital organs—and spare you from silent diseases like NAFLD, kidney strain, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil in your pan might be quietly influencing your body’s biggest filters. Treat it like the health decision it is. And next time you cook, remember: it’s not just taste—it’s longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxQcVhpeGdiNC1uU1BlYnpjbXlVTmZmQjJwS01pQzlEeFRaM3ZyMFhmM1JIZzgzSkRxMV9yTy1YelZSZ1hUXzlDQlFJM1lkNlBWaWVZcUEwUkVxLXUxZnBUcUFpVE1FSjhCZTBpSFBtbzZwbk8tM19nWlNFWk1ZYThhYWowUGhHZnlTRG80RTJZb3E4dTBQWUhTNWhnTkRWOER2TmdUQlp1YUJHZ2ZZVVQxSEQ4b2dOZFl0Uk1LOXdvcm9lSmh5cmhwSkloc0txaXVSQjR6TkYzU1FnZk44TV9ULXlxdnp2Wms0QnlIdXhiLXp3UV9hcDdEVGRUUGNHNkVHZ1hVYmRTT05jSFlsWGRpU09zYU1EVkgxN3VV</guid></item><item><title>一项研究揭示了早期痴呆症的最大风险因素，知识就是力量- BuzzFeed | A Study Has Revealed The Biggest Risk Factors For Getting Early Dementia, And Knowledge Is Power - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9ZYWtEMnlSQ0s1bnRDYzNqSGZiaElPa2NSV0FrcG9jZ1JMYmx3eHRtN21XQmJKTWR2WlUtWk5acXo5dzdrZkNic0pPd2ZpZ2M1d1VNV1hMbDRUTUc3QXNMc21jWDVDaC1fdzVFN1piNC1kcGJhdU1YMmhzamtyS00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study results are consistent with what medical experts have been advising patients for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/arman-fesharaki/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888404" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychiatry and of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine, recommended three “lifestyle measures” that folks may want to consider when trying to lower their risk of young-onset dementia ― starting with physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An active daily exercise practice can have far-reaching benefits, which include enhanced neurocognitive function,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said, adding that physical activity can boost neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons and synapses), vasculogenesis (the creation of new blood vessels) while also providing inherent mood benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, focus on eating nourishing foods. Fesharaki-Zadeh championed a Mediterranean-based diet, mentioning its well-documented benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such dietary practice, which includes food groups such as green leafy vegetables, olive oil, salmon and blueberries, is rich in vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as antioxidants ― all neuroprotective factors,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fesharaki-Zadeh recommended cognitive, mood and social stimulation to keep your mind sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cognitive stimulation, this could look like learning a new language or attending a seminar, listening to music or dancing. Basically, anything that engages your mind will help it stay healthy. Mood stimulation, on the other hand, relates to stress reduction practices, “such as mindfulness and yoga,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for social stimulation, it’s pretty simple: Try to connect with other humans face-to-face and actually talk to them as much as possible. “In the era of pandemic and now post-pandemic, quality social connections should increasingly be encouraged and practiced,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these habits don’t cover the whole list of dementia risk factors, they are a pretty solid start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/study-early-dementia-risk-factors_l_6596cf44e4b0f27b6e3691c8" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888404"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other COVID-19 symptoms of any variant include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or loss of taste or smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Experts say there isn’t major cause for concern with the Nimbus variant, but here ‘s what else you need to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="adn-article-body__h3"&gt;Where the variant is spreading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The rise in cases late last month is primarily in eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, the World Health Organization said May 28. The new variant had reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported globally in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Airport screening in the United States detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="adn-article-body__h3"&gt;You aren’t likely to get sicker from this variant than others&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Not so far, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="adn-article-body__h3"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are effective against the Nimbus variant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The WHO has designated Nimbus as a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level. Current vaccines are expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new study finds that addiction to social media, mobile phones and video games is linked to a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2835481" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study, published in JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, looked at data on more than 4,000 kids from an ongoing longitudinal study following them for years, starting at ages 9 to 10. It found that by age 14, about a third of the kids had become increasingly addicted to social media, about a quarter had become increasingly addicted to their mobile phone and more than 40% showed signs of addiction to video games.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"And these youth are significantly more likely to report suicidal behaviors and thoughts," says study author &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-yux4008" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yunyu Xiao&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's an important study and raising awareness about screen addiction," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent screen use at the University of California, San Francisco. "It shows that elements of addiction related to screen use are more strongly predictive of poorer mental health and even suicide risk compared to just screen time. So, I think that it provides more nuance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A large study known as ABCD&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Xiao and her colleagues used data from a large-scale ongoing longitudinal study called the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's been following thousands of kids over the years, and assessing them periodically for both their average daily screen time as well as for symptoms of addiction, which also allowed them to see how these addictive behaviors changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They assessed addiction with a standardized questionnaire asking them to respond to statements like, "'I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning to use the social media apps,'" explains Xiao. "'I try to use the social media app less, but I can't.' And also 'I feel stressed and or upset if I am not allowed to use my social media apps' or 'I use it so much already it has a bad effect on my schoolwork.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her team was able to group the teens based on how these answers changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With social media, they found that almost 60% had low levels of addiction to social media and that stayed stable over the years. But about a tenth had increasing addiction that peaked around year three and four of the study, and a third showed increasing addiction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With mobile phone use, about half showed high addiction and a quarter had increasing addiction. With video games, they found only two groups — with about 60% showing low addiction that stayed stable over time, and 41% were highly addicted to it through the period.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Questions about suicidal behavior&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also evaluated suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It uses a questionnaire that asked about passive and active thoughts of suicide, as well as any suicide attempts. At year four of the study, nearly 18% reported having had suicidal thoughts, and 5% admitted to suicidal behaviors, which includes making suicide plans and attempts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The groups with high and increasing addiction to mobile phone and social media were associated with a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The highly addictive group for video games also had a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to the group with low addictive use. However, total screen time was not linked to a higher suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What surprised us is that these are substantial groups, and they are associated with 2 to 3 times [risk] of suicidal behaviors," says Xiao.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Screen time is not inherently good or bad&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers, educators, and parents often point to the amount of time teens spend on their screens to gauge problematic use, say Xiao and Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We all get reports from our phones about our weekly screen time," says Nagata. "Screen time is an easily understandable metric because it's minutes or hours a day that we're spending on screens."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But, he adds, screen time isn't inherently good or bad, so he welcomes the nuance this study adds to the conversation since it flags signs of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Some kids might spend their time on screen reading the news, and some might be trolling some pretty dangerous sites," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://mitch.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "So it's really hard to know what to make of screen time as a risk factor."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why screen time alone is "not a helpful measure," says psychologist Mary Alvord. It's more important to understand how a teen is using their screen time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They may be talking to a friend, but are they talking to a friend I-R-L, or are they talking to an avatar created by AI?" says Alvord. "And are they using screens to avoid things in real life?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Avoidance of real life is a red flag&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the statements in the addictive use questionnaire is: "I play video games so I can forget about my problems."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Avoidance is a key symptom of both anxiety and depression," says Alvord, and it is revelatory about a teen's mental health status and relationship with video games or screens in general.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're starting to really try and understand what are the specific features or the specific behaviors that might be more concerning," explains Prinstein, who has co-chaired the American Psychological Association's &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advisory panel on social media use in adolescents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "And the extent to which kids say, 'I can't stop even when I'm trying to. I'm having withdrawal, dependence, tolerance symptoms,' that's important."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata has also used data from the ABCD study&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; to understand how teens are using social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over time and how that's affecting their risk of mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One thing that was really striking to me is that, unfortunately, these symptoms of screen addictions are actually pretty common," says Nagata. He also found that some of the symptoms get more common over time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues found that 47.5% of 11-12 year olds said that "I lose track of how much I am using my phone," 22.5% said "I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning my use of social media apps" and 18.4% said "I use social media apps so I can forget about my problems."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;By age 12-13, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;25% said they use social media to forget about their problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and 25% admitted to spending a considerable amount of time thinking about social media apps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Using the same data from the ABCD study, he and his colleagues also found that time on social media increased for preteens over the course of the study. "At the beginning of the study, the average time was only 7 minutes a day, but four years later, the average time was over 70 minutes a day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834349?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=052125" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; the more time these kids spent on social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the more their depressive symptoms increased.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents, teachers, clinicians should be, on the lookout for warning signs for screen addictions, particularly as they may relate to higher depression risk or suicide risk in teenagers," Nagata says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain might have a hidden "off switch" for binge drinking, and it seems to be governed by fewer than 500 brain cells, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published June 10 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1821025981045921917&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-025-01970-x%23Sec10&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falcohol%2Fthe-brain-might-have-a-hidden-off-switch-for-binge-drinking" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x#Sec10" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-025-01970-x%23Sec10&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falcohol%2Fthe-brain-might-have-a-hidden-off-switch-for-binge-drinking" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that in mice, activating or blocking this unique cluster of brain cells, or neurons, can suppress or unleash binge drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the same "off switch" can be found in humans, this tiny neural circuit could become a new target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have learned over the past five to 10 years is that the diversity [of the brain] is absolutely staggering, and it doesn't take many neurons to control behaviors," lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133252" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133252" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gilles Martin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurobiology at UMass Chan Medical School, told Live Science. "This study seems to really agree with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-brake-in-the-brain-3"&gt;A brake in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past decade, scientists have suspected that the medial orbitofrontal cortex — a brain region that helps weigh whether a reward is worth its negative consequences — has been involved in binge drinking. But until now, they didn't have the technical know-how to understand what was going on inside this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using new mice that had been genetically engineered to have the molecular equivalent of a genetic light switch, Martin and his colleagues looked for hidden structures inside this complex web of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used optogenetics — a technique in which light stimulation can be used to switch certain genes on or off — to identify in real time which brain cells lit up in response to alcohol consumption. They could then excite or suppress that region of the brain to see how it affected the mice's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tNw8KSbLTmUUdd5xdCMcnE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tNw8KSbLTmUUdd5xdCMcnE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a tiny cluster, made up of about 4% of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, lit up when the mice drank alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/what-counts-as-binge-drinking-what-about-high-intensity-drinking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/what-counts-as-binge-drinking-what-about-high-intensity-drinking"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What counts as 'binge drinking'? What about 'high-intensity drinking'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists switched off that cluster, the mice's drinking went "up and up and up" every week, Martin said. When those neurons were switched on, the mice drank a lot less. This suggests the cluster acts as a "built-in brake mechanism that was previously unknown," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of this cluster did not seem to affect other behaviors, and the study showed it didn't change how much water the mice drank or how much they moved around, Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's the first instance where a drug of abuse turns on a bunch of neurons that will actually counter its effects," Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to see whether humans also have such an off switch. But if confirmed, these findings could help explain why some people have a harder time resisting binge drinking than others: This brain circuit could be less active in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If people don't have these aversive negative cues, this can promote excessive alcohol drinking," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=dwerner" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=dwerner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Werner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychology who studies the neurobiology of alcohol use at Binghamton University in New York and was not involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research on this "unique" subset of neurons, Werner added, could reveal new treatment targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="surprising-findings-3"&gt;Surprising findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these off-switch neurons were found in the prefrontal cortex was the most surprising finding of all, Martin said. Past studies have shown that these inhibitory neurons, which create aversions to certain behaviors or experiences, were usually found in other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what is happening in people who binge drink repeatedly over a long period, Martin said, as the study did not investigate what happens after long-term stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprise was that this cluster of neurons also seems to be alcohol-specific. In the study, the activation of the cluster did not change the mice's consumption of saccharine — which is essentially sugar, another stimulant with a strong reward feedback loop, Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My hunch is now that each drug will probably activate a very distinct neuronal ensemble," Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner noted that alcohol has "a number of targets" in the human brain. For him, it will be very interesting to examine how this cluster fits into the picture of alcohol use disorder that includes all of these brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is going to cause one person to have alcohol use disorder is not going to work for the next," Werner speculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DENVER—&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/psilocybin.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/psilocybin.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, can alleviate depression for at least five years after a single dose, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, presented June 18 at the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.psychedelicscience.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.psychedelicscience.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Psychedelic Science 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conference in Denver, focused on patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is often called clinical depression. The serious mood disorder causes a persistent feeling of sadness and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable. The most common treatments for MDD include talk therapy and medications such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and both can take a long time to show any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When early studies hinted at psilocybin's potential as an antidepressant, a team of researchers undertook the first-ever randomized clinical trial to explore the use of the psychedelic for treating severe depression. The trial included 24 patients, half of whom received psilocybin at the very start of the trial and half of whom received the same dose eight weeks later—the "waitlist" group. Each patient also received 11 hours of psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in that short time frame, "there was a significant reduction in depression in the immediate-treatment group compared to those on the waitlist," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csw.osu.edu/faculty/davis-alan/" target="_blank" data-url="https://csw.osu.edu/faculty/davis-alan/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alan Davis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education at The Ohio State University, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once all of the patients had completed the four-week study, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the psilocybin appeared to be four times more effective than traditional antidepressant medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185157" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185157" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous research data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One month after the treatment, 17 patients had relieved symptoms, including 14 who were in full remission from depression. Patients also responded much faster to psilocybin than is typical for conventional antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do these benefits of psilocybin last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/magic-mushrooms-temporarily-dissolve-brain-network-responsible-for-sense-of-self" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/magic-mushrooms-temporarily-dissolve-brain-network-responsible-for-sense-of-self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic mushrooms temporarily 'dissolve' brain network responsible for sense of self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vdxzPVjowkrc8EBRv8BNgS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vdxzPVjowkrc8EBRv8BNgS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few long-term studies of psilocybin for depression have been conducted to date, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.psychiatry.wisc.edu/staff/raison-m-d-charles-l/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.psychiatry.wisc.edu/staff/raison-m-d-charles-l/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Charles Raison&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human ecology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very difficult to do because people drop out," Raison told Live Science in an email. "But also because they go on all sorts of other treatments that obfuscate the degree to which any longer lasting benefits result from the psychedelic or because the participant got therapy or restarted an antidepressant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the benefits for psilocybin lasted and if the patients had experienced any side effects, the researchers contacted the original trial participants several years later to request their enrollment in a follow-up study. Twenty-one patients enrolled, and their clinicians rated any changes in the participants' levels of depression from before the original treatment to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also filled out a series of self-reported, online questionnaires and met up with clinicians to document their ability to engage in everyday tasks, their levels of anxiety and their general mental health. The researchers assumed that the three patients that didn’t sign up for the follow up, and the three that didn’t complete the questionnaires had not remained in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the researchers found that 67% of the participants who had suffered from depression half a decade earlier remained in remission after a single psychedelic therapy session. These patients also reported less anxiety and less difficulty functioning on a daily basis. In general, the two-thirds of the patients who responded well reported lasting positive changes in their mindsets, emotional health and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited by these deeper aspects of their lives that really speaks to the importance of these interventions beyond just reduction of depression," Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients shared that, following the original treatment, they'd engaged in self-reflection and therapy to help understand themselves and navigate life's challenges. Davis hypothesizes that the psychedelic experience catalyzes a deeper therapy process and would like to conduct future studies comparing the relative influences of psilocybin and psychotherapy in alleviating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest caveat of this study is the small sample size, and the fact that the original trial showed larger antidepressant effects than subsequent larger multi-site studies seem to be showing," Raison said. In a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-site clinical trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with 233 participants, 37% of the 79 who received a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin, coupled with psychotherapy, went into remission from major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these trials report less widespread antidepressant effects, they support the idea that psilocybin can effectively treat depression, Davis said, and he is keen to see how the findings of multi-site trials hold up five years post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warning: Photos of addictively smooth skin ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tired of paying for pricey in-office chemical peels? Me too. Though they’re unmatched for &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/p/noble-panacea-the-brilliant-discovery-ritual-prod277570094" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;minimizing pores and fine lines&lt;/a&gt; and smoothening and brightening skin, the cost and time commitment are a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it felt serendipitous when the editor-approved &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Noble Panacea Overnight Chronobiology Peel&lt;/a&gt; came my way. The &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/style/best-anti-aging-skincare-products-per-celebrities/"&gt;celeb-approved skincare&lt;/a&gt; has graced the &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/05/22/style/noble-panacea-at-home-peel-works-overnight/"&gt;ageless faces of Salma Hayek and Jenna Lyons&lt;/a&gt; — plus supermodel Christy Turlington is such a fan, she’s even partnered with the brand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Did my skin-goals celeb crushes know something that I didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Overnight Chronobiology Peel&lt;/a&gt; is an at-home chemical peel created to work while you sleep, and each package includes eight treatments. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Made with Organic Super Molecular Vessels (OSMV), it’s designed to deliver active ingredients via tiny cells that are 10,000 times smaller than a skin cell. It  also contains AHAs and BHA to target a plethora of skin woes, including &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, acne scars, enlarged pores and uneven skin tone&lt;/a&gt;. (It’s meant to work with your sleep cycle, releasing soothing agents towards the end.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The heavy-duty sustainable packaging&lt;/a&gt; opens to packets of a clear, unscented gel, packed with enough product to apply on your face, neck and décolleté. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first time I slathered it on, I immediately felt a tingle — a must for me to feel like it’s working. You leave it on for five to ten minutes before applying your regular night cream (though the instructions say don’t use it with retinol or other AHAs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over my 10 minutes of use, the sensation was there but not uncomfortable; it was on par with what I’ve experienced in a doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I dozed off to bed, I noticed a glassy, taught look to my face. Hoping for the best, I said a little prayer,&lt;em&gt; “Lord, make me glowy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was a bit concerned that I had tried it the night before an event — and didn’t want to wake up looking burned or flaky — thankfully that wasn’t an issue; the next morning, I awoke to slightly pink cheeks, and my pores seemed to have run away, as I couldn’t find them anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eager for more benefits, I promptly contacted &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746"&gt;Noble Panacea to ask &lt;/a&gt;if I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; wait a full week for the next application. The brand confirmed that if the first treatment doesn’t cause much sensitivity, two times per week is fine. I gleefully applied again after four days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My skin began to acclimate, and it was a little less spicy the second time. I followed the same steps and awoke to glowy, soft and poreless skin — now, I’m hooked. Since I’m of the baby-oil-over-SPF generation, I have plenty of &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;sun damage that I’m hoping to say goodbye to, thanks to this peel. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also of note? For a “peel,” my skin doesn’t peel at all, which was unexpected — routine-wise, it’s more like using a mask. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I’ve only applied it three times thus far, based on the results, I can’t wait to finish the treatment. According to the brand’s clinical trials, the results &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;start showing after four uses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Noble Panacea was developed&lt;/a&gt; by a Nobel-prize-winning chemist, Sir Fraser Stoddart, with a science-based approach to skincare. Despite its lab origins, the line is made with non-irritating, planet- and human-friendly ingredients and is cruelty-free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I’ve tested my fair share of luxe skincare as a beauty editor, this overnight treatment has me waking up like I just got my favorite Hydrofacial: smooth, bright and soft, without any real irritation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though not &lt;em&gt;inexpensive&lt;/em&gt;, it certainly saves me a bundle from seeing a facialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a gentle yet effective anti-aging treatment that can be done from the comfort of your home, &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;consider Noble Panacea’s The Exceptional Overnight Chronobiology Peel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29yssw000w3b763gyd2z71@published"&gt;My wife “Electra” is having an extreme reaction to a normal childhood stunt. Last weekend, our 8-year-old son, “Dion,” and his friend, “Mason” (also 8), were playing in the wooded area behind our home. There’s a pond there where the kids like to catch frogs, and the boys had caught one when Mason grabbed something from his bag.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc2a0qpw001w3b764x7fvo6x@published"&gt;It was a firecracker, which Mason then apparently shoved in the frog’s mouth, lit the fuse, and the frog blew up. This happened just as my 12-year-old daughter was coming to look for them. She told my wife, who took Mason home, told his parents what he did and said he could no longer play with Dion.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29zoam001e3b76morypp0n@published"&gt;I’ve tried to talk some sense into her—I even told her that I did the same thing a couple of times when I was a young boy—but she is adamant that Mason never be allowed in our house again. I can see maybe imposing a time-out for a month or so, but isn’t this rather extreme?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29ykdv000p3b76phiflkv2@published"&gt;Well, I agree and disagree with both of you. I do think it’s &lt;em&gt;definitely bad&lt;/em&gt; to do what these two kids did, rather than just being an ill-advised “stunt.” But I also think that humans have a somewhat natural impulse to treat small animals as, in essence, toys rather than living things, and that this doesn’t necessarily mean that anyone involved is headed toward being strapped to a chair in a maximum-security prison like Hannibal Lecter.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29ykfa000q3b76vryqpwvx@published"&gt;I think the important immediate question, then, isn’t whether Mason and Dion can ever see each other again, but how they feel about what happened. Were they remorseful or upset? Do they understand why this is in the category of things you shouldn’t do? Have they expressed self-directed intent not to do something like it again? If so, I don’t see why they shouldn’t be allowed to play together again, though perhaps after a cooling-off period and with some more adult oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29xw5t00ppxjklan2xcbpt@published"&gt;Our son, almost 17, shares his otherwise unique name with an adult film star. We first realized this about two years ago, and the problem has only gotten worse, as the star has become more … prolific. Any search of the name yields only pages and pages of the star’s porn links. There’s no shortened form or nickname, and our son has no middle name, so we don’t have options but to legally change it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/11/make-child-change-name-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;The problem is our son does not want to do this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that four specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are significantly different in people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this information, they developed an AI-powered olfactory system that distinguished between PD and non-PD samples with 94% accuracy. This inexpensive, non-invasive technique could revolutionize early detection and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Four volatile compounds in ear wax were found to differ significantly in people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; An artificial intelligence olfactory system achieved 94% accuracy in classifying PD vs non-PD samples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Ear wax is a protected and stable source of sebum-based biomarkers, offering a reliable testing medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;ACS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most treatments for Parkinson’s disease (PD) only slow disease progression. Early intervention for the neurological disease that worsens over time is therefore critical to optimize care, but that requires early diagnosis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current tests, like clinical rating scales and neural imaging, can be subjective and costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111010"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a person cleaning their ear." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in ACS’ &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt; report the initial development of a system that inexpensively screens for PD from the odors in a person’s ear wax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that changes in sebum, an oily substance secreted by the skin, could help identify people with PD. Specifically, sebum from people with PD may have a characteristic smell because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by sebum are altered by disease progression — including neurodegeneration, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when sebum on the skin is exposed to environmental factors like air pollution and humidity, its composition can be altered, making it an unreliable testing medium. But the skin inside the ear canal is kept away from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Hao Dong, Danhua Zhu and colleagues wanted to focus their PD screening efforts on ear wax, which mostly consists of sebum and is easily sampled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify potential VOCs related to PD in ear wax, the researchers swabbed the ear canals of 209 human subjects (108 of whom were diagnosed with PD). They analyzed the collected secretions using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of the VOCs the researchers found in ear wax from people with PD were significantly different than the ear wax from people without the disease. They concluded that these four VOCs, including ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane, are potential biomarkers for PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong, Zhu and colleagues then trained an artificial intelligence olfactory (AIO) system with their ear wax VOC data. The resulting AIO-based screening model categorized with 94% accuracy ear wax samples from people with and without PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This method is a small-scale single-center experiment in China,” says Dong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The authors acknowledge funding from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of Science, Pioneer and Leading Goose R&amp;amp;D Program of Zhejiang Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#adc8f2cccfcfc2d9d9edcccede83c2dfca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Abbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://acs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ACS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Abbott – ACS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An Artificial Intelligence Olfactory-Based Diagnostic Model for Parkinson’s Disease Using Volatile Organic Compounds from Ear Canal Secretions&lt;/a&gt;” by Danhua Zhu et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Artificial Intelligence Olfactory-Based Diagnostic Model for Parkinson’s Disease Using Volatile Organic Compounds from Ear Canal Secretions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative condition, poses a major global challenge. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a diagnostic model for PD that analyzes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ear canal secretions (ECS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine ECS samples from patients, four VOC components (ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane) were identified as biomarkers with statistically significant differences between PD and non-PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic models based on these VOC components demonstrate strong capability in identifying and classifying PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the PD diagnostic model, this study introduces a protocol for extracting features from chromatographic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating gas chromatography–surface acoustic wave sensors (GC-SAW) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the system achieves an accuracy of up to 94.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further enhancements to the diagnostic model could pave the way for a promising new PD diagnostic solution and the clinical use of a bedside PD diagnostic device.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:30:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE0zR3hyaDJuLThlZUVfTC1IY2JiTndkemJWTTY4WVNaZVZscW1zS01VZXRTNjN0el9OdUdROWJZTGtVX1A5dE5nZzZNa3F0NE1BbWpPVmtPcFJfNjdDSTh1V3hHQ3c</guid></item><item><title>与癌症相关的饮料、负面想法的影响以及保护听力的方法-福克斯新闻 | Drink linked to cancer, impact of negative thoughts and ways to protect hearing - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMzhwd3B6cjVkOVI0MjhPckNHQk9naGwzZXhBUkJ3bzRySUJvYVA0Q2V5LUpGT3hDV1hHRV9UNzBpbmtVYjVPQUR3WlM0eHpzbi1JNEFwWGZVSHpkS2pzVVRYZDVDaGRNcnhKbUJ2aXNObmFhdG93dGdQSDB1N09mcjk1TGZDWU9ZQmFmMk1iWWQ5c3JwTVhKVWlxOEzSAaIBQVVfeXFMTWRrd2NaUi1nSnM1ZExDaWdqeGc3d1drR3kwekhNVWtZSS03ZHd5RlYtN3F2bFBPMDRSdHFFMGpYSmw1OUIwQWpfRllnYloyalBTVmNtYmRZRVVLN3dBOG5QUC1ZblhCVml3YTZYWWRKWDQ4c2s3dWxKaWppcW1od1dUSm10bl8tQm5NbmtSS3kxamM0WWVXR2tJY3RkZkJENVZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:07:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMzhwd3B6cjVkOVI0MjhPckNHQk9naGwzZXhBUkJ3bzRySUJvYVA0Q2V5LUpGT3hDV1hHRV9UNzBpbmtVYjVPQUR3WlM0eHpzbi1JNEFwWGZVSHpkS2pzVVRYZDVDaGRNcnhKbUJ2aXNObmFhdG93dGdQSDB1N09mcjk1TGZDWU9ZQmFmMk1iWWQ5c3JwTVhKVWlxOEzSAaIBQVVfeXFMTWRrd2NaUi1nSnM1ZExDaWdqeGc3d1drR3kwekhNVWtZSS03ZHd5RlYtN3F2bFBPMDRSdHFFMGpYSmw1OUIwQWpfRllnYloyalBTVmNtYmRZRVVLN3dBOG5QUC1ZblhCVml3YTZYWWRKWDQ4c2s3dWxKaWppcW1od1dUSm10bl8tQm5NbmtSS3kxamM0WWVXR2tJY3RkZkJENVZ3</guid></item><item><title>一名俄克拉荷马州蹒跚学步的孩子在基斯通湖游泳后感染了多种大肠杆菌，为自己的生命而战-雅虎 | An Oklahoma toddler fights for her life after contracting multiple strains of E. coli after swimming at Keystone Lake - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JcXhjQTI2SWZjWmMzUE5DaXNWWkx2cE41bmNlcVBTZS1Sd2twOTNTWWdXSW5FcFZSek1lbFFGUzR5cXVteVBLVC15TF83ZFppSUpNNlJJMDZGRVZDejV5dGd0UmVJZWRMTWxRQmdTVzMzNGJ4MkcxY09IUjdPR00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2-year-old is fighting for her life after contracting three strains of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/newborn-died-within-hours-doctor-194308587.html" data-ylk="slk:E. coli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt; while swimming in Keystone Lake, her family says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Toddler Elisabeth Faircloth was swimming and boating with her family in &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/oklahoma-grayson-african-abraham-lincoln-juneteenth-b2771794.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oklahoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; in early June when she started feeling sick.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tattoos have always been a part of human culture, with some examples dating back &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ancient-tattoos-lasers-peru-mummies-2b6c0dd724e18af39727553721075449"&gt;thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/15/32-of-americans-have-a-tattoo-including-22-who-have-more-than-one/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey found that nearly a third of Americans have tattoos. Over the past 20 years, shifting attitudes and a surge in interest have fueled the growth of tattoo culture, and Houston's scene has grown right along with it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Houston Matters producer Brenda Valdivia met the new wave of artists working in the industry at the &lt;a href="https://villainarts.com/tattoo-conventions-villain-arts/houston-tattoo-arts-convention/"&gt;Villain Arts 7th Annual Houston Tattoo Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt;. She also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/oyetewa-asempa-132861"&gt;Dr. Oyetewa Asempa, Director of the Skin of Color Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, on how to keep tattoos fresh and the skin they're inked on healthy. You can hear those conversations in the audio above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to Keep in Mind to Keep Your Tattooed Skin Healthy and Fresh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red tattoo ink is the most likely color to trigger an allergic reaction—sometimes even weeks or years after getting the tattoo—especially for individuals who begin antiretroviral treatment for HIV or undergo joint replacement surgery, according to Dr. Asempa. She recommends checking the tattoo parlor's hygiene practices, reading online reviews, and asking trusted friends for artist recommendations before booking an appointment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="721" data-end="741"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="721" data-end="741"&gt;Things to Avoid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="743" data-end="1042"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="743" data-end="823"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="745" data-end="823"&gt;Swimming or sweating soon after getting a tattoo until it fully heals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="824" data-end="882"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="826" data-end="882"&gt;Repeated exposure to UV light, such as direct sunlight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="883" data-end="965"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="885" data-end="965"&gt;Using petroleum-based products on your skin. Use water-based lotion instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="966" data-end="1042"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="968" data-end="1042"&gt;Tattooing over moles or areas of skin with a high concentration of moles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Tattoos are obscuring moles and we can’t properly evaluate them," Dr. Asempa says. "We can’t see if they’re changing color, then people may get a delayed diagnosis of melanoma, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="1044" data-end="1552"&gt;While precautions are important, many people enjoy their tattoos and the camaraderie tattoos foster within their communities. Dr. Carl Blasphemy, master of ceremonies and host for Villain Arts at the Houston Tattoo Arts Festival, shared: "My wife has the coordinates and time of when we got married tattooed on her arm, along with the date in Roman numerals. You really can’t tell what it is unless you ask her about it, because people want to share the story behind their tattoos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1554" data-end="1890"&gt;While some tattoos are bright, colorful works of art, others serve practical purposes, such as permanent makeup. These include eyebrow tattoos and permanent lipstick, as explained by Samantha Aquiningoc of Immortal Essence Cosmetics: "Often, it's more mature clients who have thinning brows or clients who want full color on their lips."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1892" data-end="1944"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1892" data-end="1944"&gt;Tattoo Artists and Festival Organizers Featured:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 variant that may be driving &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-variant-who-285a4e5146aa4a7ccb252e38accd5959"&gt;a recent rise in cases&lt;/a&gt; in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: “razor blade throat” COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because the variant — NB.1.8.1. or “Nimbus” — may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other COVID-19 symptoms of any variant include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or loss of taste or smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say there isn’t major cause for concern with the Nimbus variant, but here ‘s what else you need to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here’s where the variant causing ‘razor blade throat’ is spreading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572"&gt;The rise in cases&lt;/a&gt; late last month is primarily in eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, the World Health Organization said May 28. The new variant had reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported globally in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airport screening &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-pandemic-masks-anniversary-34f2fb0ea729e71c0809295d3e62744b"&gt;in the United States&lt;/a&gt; detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You aren’t likely to get sicker from this variant than others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so far, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are effective against the Nimbus variant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO has designated Nimbus as a “variant under monitoring” and considers the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;public health risk low at the global level&lt;/a&gt;. Current vaccines are expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;

Health professionals, however, indicate that various routine tendencies—silently neglected—are capable of subtly damaging this vital body organ. The liver is an integral part of assimilating nutrients, detoxifying toxins, and balancing metabolism. But other behaviours such as consuming excessive sugar, use of typical painkillers, and spending too much time sitting can all harm the liver. And often, the damage creeps up gradually, symptom-free, until it's too late. These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 liver-damaging habits that have nothing to do with alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Too much sugar can cause fatty liver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming high amounts of added sugar—particularly from processed foods and sweetened beverages—can overwhelm the liver. Perhaps the greatest threat is fructose, a form of sugar that the liver converts to fat. If this accumulation goes on over time, it can result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), leading to inflammation and scarring. Blood sugar spikes also cause insulin resistance, which causes the liver to work more than it must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Abusing painkillers overstrains liver function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overuse of over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen or paracetamol is a widespread but underappreciated risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver metabolises these drugs, which creates toxic waste products as a byproduct. When the liver is unable to eliminate these rapidly enough, they start to destroy liver cells and disrupt function. This is particularly hazardous in combination with other stressors such as alcohol or long-term disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Sitting too much increases liver fat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of physical activity may not seem like a direct cause of liver damage, but it plays a major role. A sedentary lifestyle leads to weight gain, insulin resistance, and fat accumulation—all of which are key drivers of fatty liver disease. Regular movement helps burn excess fat and supports liver function. Even light daily activity can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Unregulated supplements carry hidden dangers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural is not always safe. Most herbal or Ayurvedic supplements are not regulated and can contain toxic substances or contaminants such as heavy metals or steroids. Some of these chemicals are poisons to liver cells, particularly when they are taken regularly or without medical supervision. In some instances, supplements have led to inflammation of the liver or even liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Crash dieting can backfire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe dieting or fasting can upset the balance of the liver. When the body is abruptly cut off from calories, the liver can dump fat stored there into the bloodstream. This raises fat accumulation in cells of the liver and strains the organ. Crash diets also disrupt the production of bile and lower the detoxifying capacity of the liver for the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Smoking puts additional toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoke brings in toxins that raise oxidative stress and lower blood flow to the liver. Such alteration can harm liver tissue and enhance the likelihood of fibrosis over time. Additionally, the liver has to function harder to metabolise the chemicals from the smoke, placing further burden on the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to stop liver damage before it starts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most insidious things about liver damage is the way it happens quietly. Symptoms may not show up until the liver is severely compromised. That's why being proactive is so important. Being mindful of these daily habits—and making small, sustainable changes—can keep liver health intact in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s what you can do:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restrict added sugar, particularly from beverages and packaged foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take painkillers only when necessary, and always adhere to guidelines for dosage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include daily movement, even brief walking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be wary of supplements, and consult with a medical provider before taking them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid drastic diets, and try for balanced, regular meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a smoker, quit—it helps your entire body, including your liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular checkups to track liver function and identify early warning signs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxQaGExOEluMExGeVVTb0JPVlJYdW9hRHJLWnVSN2sxOTUyQlVyOVM5UUduS3BuRVdaSDRTYmJsdUswYU4wVmpob1VodnloYXB1UlhRaFNpNzhWRmNsZ1daRVJxbktsYnlYd05nQjNhWVhEamNBYVdiZWxuYWl2UmdMMHQwYnNCQ2xrTTdDUjV5aXJ6YjRPc283V0tGdmF0UFhSSGVDWW1GakdOVmszRl9PcVZNbl9KMzIzLXBsaUJqT1hSWWhud1k4Z0hoR2JTazNfRHlKOVl5a2Zpdk0wRDdOcGlzcHE5YkRSellnWUs4dlBYS3c2REUw</guid></item><item><title>这些可能是治疗膝关节炎的3种最有效的非药物方法-《华盛顿邮报》 | These may be the 3 most effective non-drug ways to treat knee arthritis - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOcUxwQmhOTUNoMGpGamh4VjNNRDlCMGR1U2dXMjVtekt3Mi1QbWZpaXpLZ083VXRpMkEzcl9VdFFsTFFKVG1Cdl9MQWJFeVhQWjU4c3VZLWxvSHM2MkFhZjNfRFFfSTJ5R3kwbVlYNm9xR19mZFpTYXl0RElfcEFGRTVTLVZhckZzYzFJS0JJcTVDOXBlV1JadHdQNDNZLU1Jdm1uNkxzc24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PE33EEC3A5A33KPPMPUKTM32JI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A knee brace appears to be one of the more effective ways to treat the pain — as well as improve function and stiffness — from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/10/10/osteoarthritis-joint-pain-treatment/"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, the common degenerative process where the cartilage cushioning the joint deteriorates over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WVWZSLSRVBC7TJFMR2EKGWO3AI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers in China ranked the relative effectiveness of a dozen treatments, ranging from laser and ultrasound therapy to wedged insoles and kinesiology tape, studied in 139 randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FVKSUYM5TNBJNDA56E356USFXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Based on the results from 9,644 participants, the simple knee brace ranked highest in effectiveness to alleviate symptoms of arthritis, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4MGTKRXFSZERHGQNAPISYVGB4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, “the challenge,” said &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=36179"&gt;Prakash Jayabalan&lt;/a&gt;, the director of musculoskeletal research at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, “is getting patients to actually wear knee braces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJCGVLNBZ5GHVBMDTN7UUPDOL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Jayabalan and other clinicians who weren’t involved in the study said knee braces can provide certain people immediate relief by supporting the load on the joint.

Cartilage can’t repair itself like other tissues in the body and, oftentimes, people don’t know they’ve lost the cartilage in their knee until it’s gone, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZOJGUWYRRBWHPHFBXJMCYNJSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are two common risk factors for knee arthritis — a previous knee injury such as an ACL tear and unhealthy weight gain, said &lt;a href="https://hes.wfu.edu/people/faculty/steve-messier/"&gt;Steve Messier&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the J.B. Snow Biomechanics Laboratory at Wake Forest University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ADE3W2E75NES7HJ3ML4KPHKG5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Every pound of additional body weight amounts to four pounds of stress on the knees when a person is walking, Messier said. Once someone has arthritis in their knee, they need to make broad lifestyle changes with regular exercise to manage the pain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZGRMN6OBF5FU7D3PGJ3N2OJMUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It really doesn’t matter what type of exercise you do, just so you’re being active,” Messier said. “They all will reduce pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7Z4ANDBAUVDSBACVFEE5TN32A4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other clinicians agree staying active is one of the best ways to relieve knee arthritis pain. It’s the first recommendation in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063458419311161"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; published in 2019 from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="33CMXNX6GFBAJIC3RTBTNYBAFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/osteoarthritis/index.html"&gt;33 million U.S. adults have osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(21)00810-4/fulltext"&gt;commonly&lt;/a&gt; take NSAIDs such as ibuprofen to relieve the symptoms.

The team found the parasite interferes with essential communication between brain cells — research that can offer new ways to detect and treat chronic brain infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; can infect nearly any warm-blooded animal and prefers to live inside brain cells, forming cysts in neurons that can persist for life. The researchers report that they found infected neurons release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs) — tiny, membrane-bound packets used by cells to exchange information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="align-left"&gt;


&lt;figcaption&gt;Emma Wilson&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/emmaw"&gt;Emma H. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of &lt;a href="https://biomed.ucr.edu/"&gt;biomedical sciences&lt;/a&gt; in the UC Riverside &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucr.edu/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who led the research team. “Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10–30% of people in the United States are infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, often without knowing it. The parasite is typically contracted through undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces. Although the immune system typically keeps the infection in check, the parasite can lie dormant in the brain for decades. In individuals with weakened immunity, it can reactivate and cause serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic tools can only detect whether someone has been exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; by identifying antibodies. The tools cannot confirm whether the parasite is still present in the brain or how it may be affecting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our research opens the door to using EVs as biomarkers, which can be isolated from blood,” Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted using mouse models and human cells in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson explained that in healthy mouse brains astrocytes regulate neurotransmitters like glutamate, ensuring that neurons do not become overexcited. But when neurons infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; stop sending the right EV signals, this regulation breaks down. The result is elevated glutamate levels, which can lead to seizures, neural damage, or altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s research team is now working to analyze samples from human blood banks to look for EVs linked to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; brain infection. The team also hopes to better understand how glial cells detect and respond to parasite proteins — insights that could one day lead to new therapies or even vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;,” Wilson said. “If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential impact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is often misunderstood, Wilson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to avoid someone who is infected; most people live their entire lives without symptoms,” she said. “Pregnant individuals should be cautious as the parasite can cause serious birth defects if contracted for the first time during pregnancy. The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson was joined in the study by Emily Z. Tabaie, Ziting Gao, Nala Kachour, Arzu Ulu, Stacey Gomez, Zoe A. Figueroa, Kristina Bergersen, and Wenwan Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported, in part, by funds from the UCR Division of Biomedical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; is titled “&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; infection of neurons alters the production and content of extracellular vesicles directing astrocyte phenotype and contributing to the loss of GLT-1 in the infected brain.” &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Hold your horses, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists have created an experimental vaccine that could be effective against multiple types of fungal germs, including those that cause vaginal yeast infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Georgia developed the vaccine candidate, code-named NXT-2. In their latest study with mice, NXT-2 appeared to protect the animals from a common culprit of yeast infection, &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;. The team is now planning to forge ahead with human trials of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to bacteria or viruses, fungi don’t make people sick as often. But there are some common fungal illnesses that cause plenty of misery, including yeast infections and ringworm. Fungi can also cause serious, life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems or otherwise poor health. And fungal infections in general are becoming &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deaths-fungal-infections-deadly-resistant-fungi-climate-1851169272"&gt;more common,&lt;/a&gt; possibly due to factors like climate change (fungi usually prefer temperatures cooler than our bodies, but some species have likely already become more tolerant to us).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another reason why fungi are becoming more dangerous is the lack of weapons available against them. We have far fewer antifungals than antibiotics, for instance, and no approved vaccines whatsoever. While new antifungals are needed, they’re ultimately a stopgap, since fungi can adapt and evolve resistance to them. So the UGA researchers are hoping that their “pan-fungal” vaccine can provide more of a long-term solution to the most worrying fungi out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In previous animal studies, the team’s NXT-2 vaccine &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/new-vaccine-targets-fungal-infections/"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; effective at preventing or reducing harm from three of the most common sources of invasive fungal infections in people (collectively representing 80% of fatal infections). This latest research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in NPJ Vaccines, tested NXT-2 in a mouse model of vulvovaginal candidiasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NXT-2 provoked a strong immune response in the mice to &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; fungi, the researchers found, including in vaginal tissue. Vaccinated mice infected with the fungi also experienced reduced fungal burden and less vaginal tissue damage and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These studies provide supportive evidence of broad efficacy of NXT-2 and support the rationale for its further development as a single, pan-fungal vaccine for local and systemic fungal infections,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the vaccine may be able to tackle the most serious fungal infections, the researchers plan to first test it out in humans as a vaccine against recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). These infections &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30103-8/abstract"&gt;affect&lt;/a&gt; over 100 million women worldwide every year and can be incredibly stressful, the researchers note. Young and otherwise healthy women also tend to experience these infections more often, which should make recruiting potential volunteers for trials easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. As many as one in 10 women develop the condition during their lifetime, suffering three or more yeast infections per year,” said lead author Karen Norris, a professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/new-fungal-vaccine/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “This is a huge need.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Norris is also the CEO and founder of &lt;a href="https://nxtbiologics.com/"&gt;NXT Biologics&lt;/a&gt;, the biotech company developing NXT-2 commercially. And should NXT-2 succeed as hoped against yeast infections, the next step will be targeting the most dangerous fungi in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections,” Norris said.&lt;/p&gt;

They also scored high for psychological stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that being overweight and stressed out triggers chronic inflammation and hormonal imbalances in the body, creating a perfect storm for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-3d08edf0-4c52-11f0-a7cd-f9ea195159ad" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study saw volunteers restricted to eating between 12 - 8 p.m. and practice a basic daily mindfulness routine involving breathwork and sitting quietly with closed eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In eight weeks, those who stuck to both habits lost an average of 4.2 lbs compared to just 0.2 lbs in the control group who made no lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former also saw improvements to their stress scores, insulin and glucose levels, as well as a drop in visceral fat mass - the most dangerous type of fat linked to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No significant changes were observed in the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the paper, the research team said: 'This study was feasible and well accepted by the participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Results were promising, indicating a potential synergy between time restricted eating and mindfulness for improving anthropometric, metabolic and colonic inflammation among young adults with obesity and moderate to severe perceived stress.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study of 42 participants also looked at the effects of following just one of the habits, finding less pronounced health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were published in the journal Nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who took part in mindfulness exercises followed the 'Mindfulness for Beginners' program in the Calm app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involved a series of short, guided daily meditations about 10 minutes each, which involved simple, practical steps like focusing on breath, noticing thoughts and calming the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett (pictured right), from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain. She is still battling the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that mindfulness reduces food cravings by changing how the brain responds to urges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When people practice mindfulness, they learn to observe cravings as passing sensations without immediately acting on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This weakens the link between feeling a craving and reaching for food or other substances such as alcohol or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies using brain imaging show that mindfulness dampens activity in the brain’s reward and craving centers, such as the amygdala and striatum, while strengthening self-control regions like the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid an alarming rise in so-called early-onset colon cancers in people under the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates among Americans in their 20s and 30s are expected to double by 2030 compared to 2010. In teens, cases have surged 500% since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rising rates of obesity are thought to be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, the overall adult obesity rate was around 20% compared to around 40% now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say that does not tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets high in processed foods, which have been linked to inflammation, have also been suggested as a driver, as has rising stress levels in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other possible causes include the foodborne pathogen E. coli, gut changes linked to antibiotic use and changes to maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More mothers are now obese and older when they give birth, which may cause biological changes to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not just colon cancer that is rising in young people - rates of several types of cancer have been trending upwards in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;In a study published in May&lt;/a&gt;, researchers discovered 13 other cancers were found to be rising in under 50s: stomach,  pancreatic, bone and joint cancers, melanoma, breast, cervical, uterine, testicular, kidney and four types of cancers of the lymph system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc24679n001v3b77fy6dh9fh@published"&gt;She’s tried therapy, hypnosis, and every supplement on the market. She’s done sleep studies, she meditates, she does yoga, she takes medication, and has a frankly overwhelming exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpdn00133b77rc74uln2@published"&gt;The problem is that if you’re dedicating three hours of your day outside work to exercise and meditation, there’s not always time for sex. If things get busy and I suggest cutting her lengthy workout short, she gets angry. But this is a busy work season for both of us, and we don’t get to be connected. She suggested I join her workouts instead, but that’s not sex. Destroying myself at the gym or psychotic distance runs is not my idea of fun or bonding. Last time I suggested cutting down on these solo projects to make time, she retaliated by suggesting she just wake me up at 3 a.m. for sex next time she’s awake all night and that it was “exactly the same.” How do we get a balance here? I feel like I’m coming in second to her sleep obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpig00163b771w6drf80@published"&gt;Your frustration is understandable, but so is your wife’s commitment to solving the life-upending problem that is insomnia. I’m not getting a lot of empathy from your letter. Have you ever gone through a period where you’re getting less sleep than you should? It impacts everything. It makes existence cumbersome. You can feel weighed down, lack clarity to make decisions or complete tasks (especially creative ones), and yes, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25772315/"&gt;it can impact one’s sex life&lt;/a&gt;. You’re approaching this from a zero-sum mindset: If your wife spends too much time attempting to manage her insomnia, she won’t have time for sex. But the thing is, if she has insomnia, she might not want sex at all. Getting over her insomnia, then, benefits both of you, and she should be allowed to pursue solutions with minimal interference. What is the alternative in your opinion? Do you want her to just accept her insomnia and live in misery? So that you can have sex more frequently?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpjw00173b77vp9f867y@published"&gt;The first step to overcoming this issue would be for you to think about her more and yourself less. Adjust your regard for your wife, starting with the language you use to describe her behavior. Her distance runs are not “psychotic,” and if she has an “obsession” with sleep, it’s &lt;em&gt;because she’s lacking it&lt;/em&gt;. Sleep isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity. The way you present the issue is with the same regard one might for someone who spends their days wrapped up in hobbies or aesthetic “self-care” like manicures and facials. She isn’t trying to work through insomnia because it’s fun, leisurely, or relaxing. Quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpma00183b77upxhqj5s@published"&gt;Is it possible that she is being excessive in her plan to eradicate the insomnia? Of course. It may give her a sense of control where one is infuriatingly lacking. But, as you point out, she’s tried a bunch of stuff and so far, nothing’s worked. So, of course, she’s devoted to figuring this out. You want to be connected with her? Meet her where she is. Take her up on the fitness invitation. You don’t have to do every exercise she does, but spending more time together in the gym is a way that a lot of couples bond. It’s not sex, sure, but it’s better than being in two different places, not interacting. If she sees your effort, perhaps she’ll put more toward sex. Work with her. Right now, she’s wrestling with a burden, so do not add to it. Do all that you can to make her life easier. It’s what you should be doing as a partner, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpod00193b77r1ob7itx@published"&gt;Is waking you up for sex at 3 a.m. “exactly the same” as honoring your request to cut down on her endeavors to improve sleep? Not quite, but I think her point was that you’re asking her to bend to you while not giving anything in return. So try giving. It might not improve her sleep, and it might not get you laid more frequently, but at least if you do it and you don’t get results, you can point to that and ask her what else she thinks you can do together to improve your shared sex life. It will make your argument stronger when this comes up again. It will also help show that you &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not a quick-fix solution, but you’re married, so you’ve signed up to play the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

But science says it can—and the results are kind of wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewind to a 2019 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2724778#:~:text=Participants%20able%20to%20complete%20more,fewer%20than%2010%20push%2Dups." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in JAMA Network Open, which made some serious waves in the fitness and medical world. Researchers at Harvard University followed over 1,100 male firefighters for 10 years to see whether a person’s ability to perform push-ups had anything to do with their risk of heart disease. And surprise—it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the punchline: Men who could do 40 or more push-ups had a 96% lower risk of cardiovascular events (like heart attacks or heart failure) compared to those who could do fewer than 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, you read that right. Forty push-ups may just be your free, no-equipment-required ticket to checking up on your ticker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what’s the connection?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, push-ups aren’t just about chest strength. They require upper body, core, and even lower body engagement. If you can do a decent number of push-ups with good form, you likely have decent muscular endurance, healthy weight, and decent cardiovascular fitness. All of these are known to be protective factors against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Push-ups are a fast and dirty way to measure your overall physical health, which tends to go hand-in-hand with heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Justin Yang, the study’s lead author and occupational medicine specialist at Harvard, push-up capacity was a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than even traditional treadmill tests in their research group. Wild, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But don’t panic if you can’t do 40 (yet)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look—we’re not saying that doing fewer than 40 push-ups means you’re doomed. That would be dramatic (and wrong). What the research suggests is a correlation, not a cause-and-effect situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It simply means that if you have the endurance and muscle strength to crank out 40 push-ups, your heart is likely in pretty good shape. If not, it’s just a nudge—a clue that maybe it’s time to build up your strength, improve your fitness, and pay a little more attention to your overall health habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push-ups aren’t a replacement for blood tests, blood pressure monitoring, or a proper check-up. But hey, if you're looking for a quick self-test at home, this is a pretty solid place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why push-ups work as a fitness marker&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what makes push-ups unique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re compound movements, which means multiple joints and muscle groups are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They test both strength and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They require core control and body awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t fake them. No shortcuts, no fancy machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they’re often used in military and law enforcement fitness assessments for a reason—they're accessible, fast, and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike running a mile or climbing stairs, push-ups aren’t heavily affected by joint issues or weather. You can do them on your bedroom floor at 6 a.m. or at the gym after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The silent warning&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease often doesn’t show early symptoms. Many people walk around with high blood pressure, clogged arteries, or early heart damage without having a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what makes functional tests like the push-up challenge interesting—they may act as an early warning system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to get to 10 push-ups without your arms shaking like jelly, it doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy—it just means it’s time to get curious and check in. Maybe your blood pressure’s a little high. Maybe your weight crept up over the years. Maybe your lifestyle needs a little reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is power, and a couple of push-ups might just give you the spark to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start where you are—and build up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nowhere near 40 push-ups, that’s totally fine. Fitness isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick ladder to get stronger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with incline push-ups (hands on a bench or wall).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move to knee push-ups as you build strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then work up to full push-ups, even if it's just one or two a day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim to add a few reps each week. You’d be amazed at how fast the body adapts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix in cardio, stretch regularly, and clean up your diet—and suddenly your heart’s got a lot more support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push-ups don’t require a gym. They don’t need a fancy outfit. They don’t even demand much time. But according to research, they might give you more insight into your heart than you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The content in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings do not prove screen use was the cause of mental health problems. But they highlight that compulsive use, which appears to be very common, as a significant risk factor that parents and healthcare services should be alert to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Yunyu Xiao, an assistant professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and first author of the study, said: “For parents and educators, the discussion around mobile phones and social media has focused on limiting or banning use, but our results indicate more complex factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Testing interventions that work against other types of addiction may be one way to approach this type of social media and mobile phone use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come amid &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/05/does-the-uk-have-a-mental-health-overdiagnosis-problem-welfare-wes-streeting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;escalating mental health problems in young people&lt;/a&gt; and as governments are grappling with how to enforce safeguards around smartphones and social media. Against this backdrop, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01141-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists have faced a near-impossible challenge&lt;/a&gt; to try to pin down evidence of how rapidly evolving and highly personalised screen use might be linked to young people’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest study tracked almost 4,300 adolescents aged nine to 10 when they started the study. Rather than simply measuring screen time, the scientists assessed participants for “addictive use”, such as whether technology was interfering with activities like schoolwork and exercise and whether people experienced craving or feelings of distress when screens were withdrawn. Machine learning was used to cluster participants into groups based on their screen use trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For mobile phones, about half of the children reported high addictive use from the start of the study that remained high through early adolescence, and a quarter developed increasing addictive use as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For social media, 41% of children had high or increasing addictive use. For social media and mobile phones, the high and increasing addictive use trajectories were associated with a two to three times greater risk of suicidal behaviours and suicidal ideation compared with the low addictive use trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 40% of the youths had a high addictive use trajectory for video games. These adolescents were significantly more likely to report suicidal thoughts or behaviours, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression, aggression or rule-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By contrast, the total amount of time spent on social media, mobile phones and video games was not associated with future suicide-related or mental health outcomes. What mattered most was whether their use showed signs of compulsion, distress or loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Xiao said: “There are many factors that would induce addictive feelings, such as the designs of the social media or video games, some kids may also experience bullying and more adverse childhood that they find using phones more comfortable, but later they cannot stop using it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.7829?guestAccessKey=1e247dd1-cadf-430c-baad-bc5c5543ad29&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=061825" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Jama&lt;/a&gt;, raise further questions over how parents should manage children’s screen use. “We do not know if just taking away access will help, unless it is taking away access 24/7, because we know from studies of addiction management that partial access can quickly reinforce the addiction,” Xiao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Group at the University of Cambridge, said the study could not prove that technology use caused mental health problems.

Researchers analyzed data from over 500,000 individuals and found that higher-risk participants reported lower social isolation and more positive family interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While emotional support and loneliness levels remained unchanged, these individuals took part in more social activities. This could reflect early compensatory behavior or increased attention from others noticing subtle cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher genetic Alzheimer’s risk was associated with &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; reported isolation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; At-risk individuals reported better family relationships and more social participation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Reserve Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Social connectedness may help buffer the brain against dementia-related decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many experts believe that social isolation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a new study, led by UC San Francisco and Boston University, examined the social habits and genetic data of half a million Britons whose average age was 56, and found that the disease may make them more sociable rather than less – at least in the early stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111000"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a group of people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that at its earliest stage Alzheimer’s doesn’t make people less socially engaged. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What They Discovered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from UK Biobank showed that people with a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer’s reported less isolation, participation in a wider range of social activities and happier family relationships.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No differences were found between higher-risk and lower-risk individuals in measuring loneliness, friendship quality and emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that at its earliest stage Alzheimer’s doesn’t make people less socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their social lives may even expand,” said co-senior author Kotwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know for sure if they are engaging more with others, or if those around them are noticing subtle changes and giving them more support.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need to Know &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social connectedness is believed to delay or reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s by promoting cognitive reserve, the brain’s ability to maintain normal function despite aging or dementia. UCSF research has shown that other non-genetic factors influencing Alzheimer’s are physical inactivity, uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure, poor sleep, depression, current smoking and certain medications. Experts believe that 30% of Alzheimer’s may be attributed to these modifiable risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;: National Institutes of Health (P01 AG082653-01A1) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0556707f646b6b602b49606c626d45706676632b606170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Suzanne Leigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Suzanne Leigh – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Association of Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Risk with Social Connectedness in Middle- And Older-Ages&lt;/a&gt;” by Ashwin Kotwal et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Association of Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Risk with Social Connectedness in Middle- And Older-Ages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational evidence suggests that social connectedness protects against Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), but reverse causality has not been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the potential for a reverse path by estimating associations between AD genetic risk score (AD-GRS) and social connectedness across mid and late-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used data from 487,194 UK Biobank participants aged 40+ years and considered social connectedness measures capturing social isolation, loneliness, relationship satisfaction, emotional support, and diverse social activity participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean age was 56.5 (SD: 8.2) years. Higher AD-GRS was associated with a lower social isolation score (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.014 to -0.001); these associations strengthened with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher AD-GRS was associated with higher levels of family relationship satisfaction (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.01), but this association was attenuated with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher AD-GRS was associated with engaging in a wider variety of social activities (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.03), with no evidence of heterogeneity by age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with loneliness, friendship relationship quality, and perceived emotional support were null.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we did not find evidence that higher risk of AD is associated with reduced social connectedness. Instead, preclinical AD symptoms may lead to stronger family relationships and lower social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:59:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFA0LUdaOHFyR0p2bXpKdGs5UjVjdFFXTWViVE4yTjBvaEFZd2xlbnRfWlJMS0J5cklza1ZMWkE5STVDOW5XLWlObmtYM3dRbUhyNF9ORTh0b01rZ3FERk50RjBFbUhDR2g2dzB2OHQ2QQ</guid></item><item><title>记忆和习惯如何影响心理健康结果-神经科学新闻 | How Memory and Habits Shape Mental Health Outcomes - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5WRk5QOTVCdDVFbFRfWUxvU183LVVJV2tNWE0ydFl0ZXFiR2ZwV19iYmpoN2Jpd1JuYjFRd3hpZ3ZGRjJRSVE1WXZGWGdqdU9NckY5cnlDTXFhUFE0c2xseG5ndEZxeVhtSmVLYXk0bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite being rooted in science, evidence-based psychological treatments often fail to deliver lasting results because people forget much of what they learn and struggle to build new habits. A new study highlights the disconnect between what patients remember from therapy sessions and what they implement in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people retain only about 30% of clinical information, and habit formation can take months without the right support. By integrating simple tools like timely reminders and behavior cues, researchers believe treatments can be more effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Retention Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients recall only ~30% of what’s shared in therapy sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Habit Formation:&lt;/strong&gt; New behaviors can take 18 days to 36 weeks to become routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Fixes:&lt;/strong&gt; Tools like text reminders can significantly improve patient follow-through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Harvey knew she’d have to study hard when she enrolled in an 11-week course on parenting techniques earlier this year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UC Berkeley professor of psychology who researches memory, habits and sleep, Harvey printed her notes and meticulously completed each week’s homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She engaged with the instructors, who were also well-respected clinical psychologists. And she was far more engaged than her classmates, including her husband. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, when the class ended, Harvey was confronted with a familiar reality: Despite studying hard, she’d forgotten many of the lessons she was supposed to have learned and put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was far short of where you’d want a patient to be at the end of 11 sessions,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrating as it was, Harvey said her experience was a personal window into the shortcomings of what are called evidence-based psychological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These treatments, which include various forms of counseling, trauma interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy, are rooted in science and used widely to treat an array of mental health challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Harvey describes in a recent paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, these treatments often fall short because of humans’ flawed memories and difficulties creating new, healthier habits. Her research explores how subtle treatment changes could significantly improve patient outcomes — both mentally and physically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory gaps in health care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, change requires acknowledging the profound gap between what’s discussed in a clinical setting and what people actually remember after they leave. Doctors may have said the right thing, but there’s often a lack of follow-up to ensure the patient retains the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also have notoriously terrible memories, Harvey said, pointing to research showing patients only retain about 30% of information shared in a session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think us humans realize how fallible our memories are,” Harvey said. “We’ve got decades of psychological research showing that we fail to encode memories accurately. We fail to store them accurately. And we fail to retrieve them accurately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That memory gap can undermine even the best-laid treatment plans. If a patient forgets the majority of what was discussed, they’re less likely to see positive, lasting benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habits take time — and effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is only part of the puzzle. Additionally, Harvey said, we must confront how difficult it is to build new behaviors into routines — a process that social and health psychologists say can take between 18 days and 36 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are science-backed strategies to help, like pairing new actions with existing routines or activities. But without explicit discussion in clinical settings about how to make new skills habitual, patients may struggle to maintain progress after treatment ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Harvey said, existing treatments too often lead patients to forget what they’re supposed to do, and those who know what they should do often fail to regularly do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got a mental health crisis. We’ve got treatments that work. But those treatments need to be improved to get people much better,” she said. “That, I think, is a real scientific challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ongoing sleep research seeking solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding ways to address the memory and habit formation elements of health interventions doesn’t need to be overly complicated. Sometimes it’s as simple as a carefully worded text message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey’s ongoing sleep research, backed by the National Institutes of Health, focuses on memory and habit change that can lead to better sleep. In one study, her team sends participants text messages with cues, reminders and follow-ups to understand what drives habit change and, ultimately, better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 10 p.m. I will dim the lights and put my phone down,” said one automated message, setting the goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A morning message asks if the goals were met. If so, participants were rewarded with a fun fact: “Did you know dolphins and whales sleep with only half of their brain at a time so they can still swim during sleep?” If not, they were encouraged to try again the next night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early results are encouraging, she said, adding that it would be important to also study how similar interventions could scale into mental and physical health settings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can come up with augmentations that could be applied before a session, in the middle of a session or at the end of a session that are not costly,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have side effects, but they’re effective at improving outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind those improvements is a commitment to basic science, she said. Her work on memory is based on cognitive science and education research, and habit formation is deeply tied to social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down research silos, like she’s attempting to do with sleep research, is a pathway toward improving patient outcomes more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unless we’re paying attention to and adhering to what’s being found in those other fields, we just won’t be effective or as effective,” she said. “It’s like a pipeline of science at every step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the parenting class she took, Harvey said there were valuable lessons. But many of them faded from memory and never became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s sort of funny though, isn’t it? Despite all that studiousness, only a few months later, I’m struggling to recall. This, I guess, is the whole point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#305a405f585c705255425b555c55491e555445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jason Pohl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jason Pohl – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2025.104767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maximizing benefits from evidence-based psychological treatments: Memory support and habit formation as key strategies&lt;/a&gt;” by Allison Harvey et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing benefits from evidence-based psychological treatments: Memory support and habit formation as key strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) aim to reverse psychological processes that contribute to the development and/or maintenance of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed and rigorously tested through scientific research, EBPTs effectively address a broad range of mental health challenges, often as front-line treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is potential to further improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines two strategies for maximizing the benefits of EBPTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first addresses the concerning and well replicated finding that patients accurately recall only about one-third of the treatment points discussed during a session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This poor memory for treatment negatively impacts adherence to the EBPT and outcomes from the EBPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of developing and testing the Memory Support Intervention (MSI), to improve patient memory for treatment, is described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter involved leveraging findings from cognitive psychology and education to develop memory support strategies to add to EBPTs, with the goal of improving EBPT outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second strategy for maximizing the benefits of EBPTs highlights the potential of habit formation principles to enhance EBPTs. While a core goal of EBPTs is to reduce unhelpful habits and encourage adaptive ones, the science of habit formation has not been fully integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Habit-based Intervention (HABITs) was developed to explicitly incorporate habit formation elements into EBPTs. Both the MSI and HABITs are designed as adjunctive interventions, enhancing EBPTs without increasing the number or duration of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of leveraging insights from diverse fields of basic science to uncover new strategies for improving both the short- and long-term outcomes of EBPTs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:31:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5WRk5QOTVCdDVFbFRfWUxvU183LVVJV2tNWE0ydFl0ZXFiR2ZwV19iYmpoN2Jpd1JuYjFRd3hpZ3ZGRjJRSVE1WXZGWGdqdU9NckY5cnlDTXFhUFE0c2xseG5ndEZxeVhtSmVLYXk0bw</guid></item><item><title>您手机的自拍相机现在可以检测抑郁症。操作方法- NDTV | Your Phone's Selfie Camera Can Now Detect Depression.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A new technology is emerging that utilises the front-facing camera on devices to analyse emotions and monitor mental health. An app called Emobot is already being used by hundreds of patients to track their mood and assess the effectiveness of their depression treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app analyses facial expressions throughout the day and generates a report, similar to a step count or heart rate graph.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A new technology is emerging that utilises the front-facing camera on devices to analyse emotions and monitor mental health. An app called Emobot is already being used by hundreds of patients to track their mood and assess the effectiveness of their depression treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app analyses facial expressions throughout the day and generates a report, similar to a step count or heart rate graph. According to co-founder Samuel Lerman, Emobot is classified as a medical device in France, and the company is collaborating with psychiatrists to prescribe it to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/17/now-phone-can-tell-depression-using-selfie-camera-23428483/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Metro,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the team was initially afraid people would find this too intrusive, given the app constantly watches you, and a future version will even listen to your tone of voice as you go about your day via the phone microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Lerman said, "The camera is open in the background all the time."

"Nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels, supports healthy blood pressure, improves circulation and protects against arterial stiffness." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-when-you-first-wake-up-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do Within the First Hour of Waking Up, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do Within the First Hour of Waking Up, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we age, our ability to make nitric oxide declines; so supporting this production through diet is one of the easiest and most effective ways to maintain cardiovascular function and longevity, according to Dr. Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Another Helpful Addition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from leafy greens, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaynemorgan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jayne Morgan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs for &lt;a href="https://www.helloheart.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hello Heart, recommends adding fiber, especially soluble fiber,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hello Heart, recommends adding fiber, especially soluble fiber,&lt;/a&gt;

whether that's bacon, sausage, hot dogs or even deli meats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"These meats are &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-to-do-after-eating-salty-meal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high in sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high in sodium&lt;/a&gt; (salt), saturated fats, and preservatives (nitrates/nitrites) and are linked to increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, and chronic inflammation in the body," Dr. Morgan says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from hot dogs, you may also want to think twice when you go to grab your next sweet treat.

That's partly because Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes – many of which are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01911-3"&gt;still not fully understood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two proteins which are widely believed to play central roles in Alzheimer's disease are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493463/"&gt;amyloid-beta and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Amyloid-beta forms sticky plaques on the outside of brain cells. This disrupts communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau accumulate inside brain cells, where it twists into tangles. This ultimately leads to cell death. These plaques and tangles are the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This understanding, known as the &lt;a href="https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(24)00407-3/fulltext"&gt;amyloid hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, has shaped research for decades and led to treatments that aim to clear amyloid from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01077-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423010772%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Monoclonal antibody drugs&lt;/a&gt; have been approved in recent years for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they only work in the early stages of the disease. They do not reverse existing damage and may cause serious side-effects such as brain swelling and bleeding. Most importantly, they only target amyloid-beta, leaving tau untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprise twist, recent research published by my colleagues and me has found that a protein from &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; – a bacteria best known for causing stomach ulcers – can block the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.ads7525"&gt;toxic buildup of both amyloid-beta and tau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unexpected finding may point to a new strategy for the fight against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of yellow amyloid-beta plaques on neurons. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery began with a very different question. We were initially studying how &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; interacts with other microbes. Some bacteria form &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2461721"&gt;protective communities called biofilms&lt;/a&gt;, which rely on amyloid assemblies (similar in structure to the plaques which form in the brain) as a structural scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led us to wonder: could &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; influence bacterial biofilms by also interfering with amyloid assemblies in humans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We turned our attention to a well-known &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; protein called CagA. While half of the protein is known to trigger harmful effects in human cells (referred to as the C-terminal region), the other half (the protein's N-terminal region) may have protective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our surprise, this N-terminal fragment, called CagAN, dramatically reduced the formation of both bacterial amyloids and biofilms in the bacterial species &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by these results, we tested whether the same protein fragment could block the buildup of human amyloid-beta proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we incubated amyloid-beta molecules in the lab: some were treated with CagAN, while others were left as normal. We then tracked amyloid formation using a fluorescence reader and an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that treated samples had far less amyloid clump formation during the testing period. Even at very low concentrations, CagAN almost completely stopped amyloid-beta from forming amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how CagAN worked, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (which allows us to look at how molecules interact with each other) to examine how the protein interacts with amyloid-beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used computer modelling to investigate possible mechanisms. Remarkably, CagAN also blocked tau aggregation – suggesting it acts on multiple toxic proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blocking the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study has shown us that a fragment from the &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; protein can effectively block the buildup of the two proteins that are implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that bacterial proteins – or drugs modelled after them – could someday block the earliest signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the benefits may extend beyond Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In additional experiments, the same bacterial fragment blocked the aggregation of &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adbi.202101301"&gt;IAPP&lt;/a&gt; (a protein involved in type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165051" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-05672-9"&gt;alpha-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; (linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="165051" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease). All of these conditions are driven by the accumulation of toxic amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That a single bacterial fragment could interfere with so many proteins suggests exciting therapeutic potential. Though these conditions affect different parts of the body, they may be linked through cross-talk between amyloid proteins – a shared mechanism that CagAN could help disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's important to be clear: this research is still at an early stage. All of our experiments were conducted in lab settings, not yet in animals or humans. Still, the findings open a new path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study also uncovered the underlying mechanisms for how CagAN blocked the amyloid-beta and tau from forming amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways in which CagAN did this was by preventing the proteins from coming together to form clumps. They also prevented small, premature amyloid aggregates from forming as well. In the future, we will continue the detailed mechanism study and evaluate the effects in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results also prompt a question: could &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt;, long seen only as harmful, also have a protective side? Some studies have hinted at a connection between &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hel.12454"&gt;&lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection and Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, though the relationship remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery adds a new layer to this discussion, suggesting that part of &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; may actually interfere with the molecular events that lead to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means in the future, we may need to take a more precise and personalised approach. Instead of aiming to eliminate &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; completely with antibiotics, it might be more important to understand, in different biological contexts, which parts of the bacterium are harmful, and which might actually be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medicine continues to move toward greater precision, the goal may no longer be to wipe out every microbe, but to understand how some of them might work with us rather than against us.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259018/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When you think about ticks, you might picture nightmarish little parasites, stalking you on weekend hikes or afternoons in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your fear is well-founded. Tick-borne diseases are the &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.240837"&gt;most prevalent vector-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt; – those transmitted by living organisms – in the United States. Each tick feeds on multiple animals throughout its life, absorbing viruses and bacteria along the way and passing them on with its next bite. Some of those viruses and bacteria are harmful to humans, causing diseases that can be debilitating and sometimes lethal without treatment, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651"&gt;Lyme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis"&gt;babesiosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But contained in every bite of this infuriating, insatiable pest is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/47/5/707/881591"&gt;trove of social, environmental and epidemiological history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, human actions long ago are the reason ticks carry these diseases so widely today. And that’s what makes ticks fascinating for &lt;a href="https://history.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/sean-lawrence"&gt;environmental historians like me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Ticks can be tiny and hard to spot. This is an adult and nymph &lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt; on an adult’s index finger.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:28383-adult-nymph-i-scapularis.webp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changing forests fueled tick risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 18th and 19th centuries, settlers &lt;a href="https://insider.si.edu/2013/09/400-year-study-finds-northeast-forests-resilient-changing-%EF%BB%BF/"&gt;cleared more than half&lt;/a&gt; the forested land across the northeastern U.S., cutting down forests for timber and to make way for farms, towns and mining operations. With large-scale land clearing came a sharp decline in wildlife of all kinds. Predators such as bears and wolves were driven out, as were deer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As farming moved westward, Northeasterners began to recognize the ecological and economic value of trees, and they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/1942027"&gt;returned millions of acres to forest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woods regrew. Plant-eaters such as deer returned, but the apex predators that once kept their populations in check did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/stories/cattle-fever-tick-program-highlights-story-map"&gt;deer populations&lt;/a&gt; grew rapidly. With the deer came &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877959X23001140"&gt;deer ticks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt;) carrying &lt;em&gt;borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. When a tick feeds on an infected animal, it can take up the bacteria. The tick can pass the bacteria to its next victim. In humans, Lyme disease can cause fever and fatigue, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/about/index.html"&gt;if left untreated&lt;/a&gt; it can affect the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The black-legged tick, &lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt;, also known as the deer tick, ranges across the eastern half of the country. It’s one of many disease-carrying ticks in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/about/where-ticks-live.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern U.S. became a global hot spot for tick-borne Lyme disease starting around the 1970s. Lyme disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tickborne-disease-surveillance-data-summary.html"&gt;affected over 89,000 Americans in 2023, and possibly many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Californians move into tick territory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For centuries, changing patterns of human settlements and the politics of land use have shaped the role of ticks and tick-borne illnesses within their environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, humans have made it easier for ticks to thrive and spread disease in our midst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In California, the Northern Inner Coast and Santa Cruz mountain ranges that converge on San Francisco from the north and south were never clear-cut, and predators such as mountain lions and coyotes still exist there. But competition for housing has &lt;a href="https://criticalurbanenvironments.ucsc.edu/projects/wildland-urban-interface-wui-research-for-resilience/"&gt;pushed human settlement&lt;/a&gt; deeper into &lt;a href="https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/documents/usfs::wildland-urban-interface-2020-map-service/explore?path="&gt;wildland areas to the north, south and east of the city&lt;/a&gt;, reshaping tick ecology there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672918/original/file-20250608-56-p3g6mi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;A range map for the western black-legged tick.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="http://cdc.gov/ticks/about/where-ticks-live.html"&gt;National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While western black-legged ticks (&lt;em&gt;Ixodes pacificus&lt;/em&gt;) tend to swarm in large forest preserves, the Lyme-causing bacterium is actually more prevalent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240837"&gt;in small, isolated patches of greenery&lt;/a&gt;. In these isolated patches, rodents and other tick hosts can thrive, safe from large predators, which need more habitat to move freely. But isolation and lower diversity also means infections are spread more easily within the tick’s host populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to build isolated houses in the hills, rather than large, connected developments. As the Silicon Valley area south of San Francisco sprawls outward, this checkerboard pattern of settlement has fragmented the natural landscape, &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.240837"&gt;creating a hard-to-manage public health threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer hosts, more tightly packed, often means more infected hosts, proportionally, and thus more dangerous ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six counties across these ranges, all surrounding and including San Francisco, account for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/geographic-distribution-of-tickborne-disease-cases.html"&gt;44% of recorded tick-borne illnesses in California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A lesson from Texas cattle ranches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domesticated livestock have also shaped the disease threat posed by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1892, at a meeting of cattle ranchers at the Stock Raiser’s Convention in Austin, Texas, Dr. B.A. Rogers introduced a novel theory that ticks were behind recent devastating plagues of Texas cattle fever. The disease had arrived with cattle imported from the West Indies and Mexico in the 1600s, and it was taking &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/texas-cattle-fever"&gt;huge tolls on cattle herds&lt;/a&gt;. But how the disease spread to new victims had been a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672927/original/file-20250608-56-uiq74l.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;A 1905 illustration of &lt;em&gt;Rhipicephalus annulatus&lt;/em&gt;, a hard tick that causes cattle fever.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editors of Daniel’s Texas Medical Journal found the idea of ticks spreading disease &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9173108/"&gt;laughable and lampooned the hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, publishing a satire of what they described as an “early copy” of a forthcoming report on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tick’s “fluid secretion, it is believed, is the poison which causes the fever … [and the tick] having been known to chew tobacco, as all other Texans do, the secretion is most probably tobacco juice,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the ranchers, not to mention the cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sided with Rogers. Its cattle fever tick program, started in 1906, curbed cattle fever outbreaks by &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2012.00195/pdf"&gt;limiting where and when cattle should cross tick-dense areas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1938, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/stories/cattle-fever-tick-program-highlights-story-map"&gt;the government had established a quarantine zone&lt;/a&gt; that extended 580 miles by 10 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border in South Texas Brush Country, a region favored by the cattle tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This innovative use of natural space as a public health tool helped to &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/stories/cattle-fever-tick-program-highlights-story-map"&gt;functionally eradicate&lt;/a&gt; cattle fever from 14 Southern states by 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ticks are products of their environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tick-borne diseases the world over, location matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the hunter tick (&lt;em&gt;Hyalomma spp.&lt;/em&gt;) of the Mediterranean and Asia. As a juvenile, or nymph, these ticks feed on small forest animals such as mice, hares and voles, but as an adult they prefer domesticated livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For centuries, this tick was an occasional nuisance to nomadic shepherds of the Middle East. But in the 1850s, the Ottoman Empire passed laws to &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40647178?seq=1"&gt;force nomadic tribes to become settled farmers instead&lt;/a&gt;. Unclaimed lands, &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/40661841/Its_a_bad_fate_to_be_born_near_a_forest_Forest_People_and_Buffaloes_in_mid_Nineteenth_Century_North_Western_Anatolia"&gt;especially on the forested edges of the steppe&lt;/a&gt;, were offered to settlers, creating ideal conditions for hunter ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, farmers in what today is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005021%22%22"&gt;Turkey saw spikes in tick-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including a virus that causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever"&gt;a potentially fatal condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Where to check for ticks and how to remove them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably too much to ask for sympathy for any ticks you meet this summer. They are bloodsucking parasites, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s worth remembering that the tick’s malevolence isn’t its own fault. Ticks are products of their environment, and humans have played many roles in turning them into the harmful parasites that seek us out today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to clarify that ticks spread alongside the deer population.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quiet fields of &lt;strong&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/strong&gt;, a routine study on airborne particles has led to a startling discovery: a &lt;strong&gt;toxic chemical&lt;/strong&gt;, previously found only in remote regions like &lt;strong&gt;Antarctica&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, has been detected for the first time in the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;. The breakthrough came from a team of researchers from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;, who were using advanced equipment to monitor how tiny particles form and grow in the atmosphere. What they found was unexpected, sparking alarm within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Surprising Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Katz&lt;/strong&gt;, a Ph.D. student in chemistry at the university, had set out to measure the particles in the air at the &lt;strong&gt;Southern Great Plains&lt;/strong&gt; site, a rural location in &lt;strong&gt;Lamont, Oklahoma&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of just gathering data on expected pollutants, the researchers uncovered traces of&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.5c00038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Medium Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (MCCPs)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;— toxic chemicals that had never been detected in the &lt;strong&gt;Western Hemisphere&lt;/strong&gt; before. These pollutants, previously identified in distant areas like &lt;strong&gt;Antarctica&lt;/strong&gt;, are now raising concerns about their presence in the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very exciting as a scientist to find something unexpected like this that we weren’t looking for,” Katz said. His discovery is part of a growing realization that MCCPs, a type of &lt;strong&gt;toxic organic compound&lt;/strong&gt;, could be more widespread than previously believed. While the chemical has been under investigation for years in other parts of the world, its identification in Oklahoma adds an unsettling dimension to its global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Chemical’s Path to the Atmosphere&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MCCPs are used in various industries, including metalworking and &lt;strong&gt;PVC production&lt;/strong&gt;. These chemicals are not new, but they have been largely ignored by regulators — a stark contrast to &lt;strong&gt;Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs)&lt;/strong&gt;, which have been banned or heavily regulated by countries like the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;European Union&lt;/strong&gt; due to their harmful effects. However, as restrictions on &lt;strong&gt;SCCPs&lt;/strong&gt; increased, industries shifted to using MCCPs, raising concerns that these chemicals could be an unintended byproduct of global regulatory efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Katz and his team suspect that MCCPs found in the Oklahoma air may have originated from &lt;strong&gt;biosolid fertilizers&lt;/strong&gt;, often created from sewage sludge at wastewater treatment plants. These fertilizers are commonly spread on &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/archaeologists-discover-massive-1000-year-old-native-american-fields-that-rewrite-the-story-of-early-indigenous-agriculture/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="92298" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;agricultural fields&lt;/a&gt;, and it is plausible that the&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/worlds-most-dangerous-waste-sites-may-be-the-next-gold-mine/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="89601" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; toxic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; are released into the atmosphere through this process. Although the researchers could not directly confirm this theory, the presence of MCCPs in the air mirrors what has been observed with other pollutants released by biosolid fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Regulatory Gaps and Environmental Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings in Oklahoma underscore a significant gap in environmental regulation. While &lt;strong&gt;SCCPs&lt;/strong&gt; have been regulated under the &lt;strong&gt;Stockholm Convention&lt;/strong&gt; — an international treaty aimed at protecting human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants — MCCPs remain largely unregulated. Experts warn that this oversight could have long-term consequences, as MCCPs are similar to &lt;strong&gt;PFAS&lt;/strong&gt;, another class of “forever chemicals” that persist in the environment and human bodies for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The lack of regulation has fueled a broader debate about the unintended consequences of regulating one toxic chemical only for it to be replaced by another. &lt;strong&gt;Ellie Browne&lt;/strong&gt;, a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder and a co-author of the study, explained, “We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there’s still a need for the products that those were in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

It’s in pharmacies, parties, pain clinics, and political speeches. Many use it to sleep better, relax, or deal with pain. Some cannabis users even see it as a natural alternative to pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the world embraced cannabis, heart doctors started noticing something else. A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Heart&lt;/em&gt;, based on data from over 432 million people, has revealed a clear &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who use cannabis have a much higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even dying from heart disease. That’s not fear-mongering – it’s data from .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-people-are-using-stronger-cannabis"&gt;More people are using stronger cannabis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In over half of the states in the U.S., and in some countries in Europe, like France, doctors can give cannabis to patients as medicine, but using it just for fun is still illegal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s not allowed for fun, many young people in France still use it a lot. Germany recently changed its laws and now lets people use cannabis recreationally, starting in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now more people use cannabis, and the products they’re using are stronger than before. Today’s cannabis has more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-reveal-the-most-complete-cannabis-genome-yet/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;. That means stronger effects on the brain and body – especially the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-to-heart-problems"&gt;Cannabis linked to heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 3,012 studies. Among them, 24 studies were focused on the link between cannabis and major heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the research showed that people who use &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; have a 29 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 20 percent higher risk of stroke, and more than double the risk of dying from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regular-use-raises-stroke-risk"&gt;Regular use raises stroke risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk didn’t look the same in every study. A few didn’t find strong links, especially in people who used cannabis once or twice. But when the researchers zoomed in on heavy users or younger adults, the risk became clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, one study found that people who used &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-in-any-form-directly-linked-to-significant-risk-of-heart-damage/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; weekly were nearly five times more likely to suffer a stroke or mini-stroke. A U.S. hospital database also found increased risk, especially in people aged 25 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that occasional cannabis use may not be a red flag. But regular use, especially while young, is when things start looking risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-to-more-heart-attacks"&gt;Cannabis linked to more heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study showed that cannabis users aged 15 to 22 were 36 percent more likely to have a heart attack. Another found that people using cannabis &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-directly-linked-to-head-and-neck-cancer/"&gt;more than once a week&lt;/a&gt; had more than double the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s after adjusting for tobacco, cocaine, and other drugs. Cannabis came out as the strongest predictor in a French hospital study – even stronger than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-cocaine-tricks-and-hijacks-the-brain/"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not the story we usually hear about cannabis. But these numbers speak louder than opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-higher-death-risk-from-heart-disease"&gt;Higher death risk from heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of fatal cardiovascular events was also investigated. In one study, young patients who had heart attacks and also used cannabis were far more likely to die. The link remained consistent even after controlling for smoking and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study conducted in the United States confirmed that cannabis users had a much higher chance of dying from heart-related causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, a 2024 study revealed an unexpected twist. Women, not men, faced higher risks of heart-related death from heavy cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-the-benefits-of-cannabis"&gt;What about the benefits of cannabis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis has shown several proven medical benefits, especially when used under a doctor’s guidance. One of its most recognized uses is for managing chronic pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with conditions like arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or nerve-related injuries often find relief through cannabis-based treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant’s compounds – mainly THC and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;CBD&lt;/a&gt; – can interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system to reduce pain signals and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical cannabis also &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-may-ease-cancer-symptoms-like-pain-and-nausea/"&gt;helps cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; by easing nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, and in some cases, it can stimulate appetite for those struggling with weight loss due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have also used cannabis to help patients with neurological disorders. In certain forms of epilepsy, especially in children, CBD-based medications have reduced the number and severity of seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples reflect how cannabis, when used appropriately, can provide real and sometimes life-changing benefits for patients, making it easier for some to ignore the overall health implications attached to cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-urge-tobacco-style-warnings"&gt;Experts urge tobacco-style warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets,” noted Professor Stanton Glantz and Dr. Lynn Silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized that today’s cannabis is not what it used to be. It now includes potent concentrates, synthetic versions, and a growing variety of edible and inhalable forms. These may carry risks beyond the cannabinoids themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalized, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should ask about cannabis use, particularly when it comes to patients with heart problems. For people using cannabis regularly, it’s time to rethink the idea that it is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a

class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Katherine Russell, from the UKHSA, said: "Human cases of rabies are extremely rare in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you are bitten,

class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Men have shared their experiences with one of the more obscure side-effects of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The use of GLP-1 &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;, which were originally made to treat type 2 diabetes, have increased in recent times thanks to their popularity among &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Medications such as &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or Mounjaro have become easy to access, as people can now get their jabs through the NHS usually prescribed for the purpose of weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But with any drugs on offer comes a range of side-effects, which users have not been shy to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/avery-singer-ozempic-side-effect-osteoporosis-bone-density-246463-20250509"&gt;share on

Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; have openly revealed that they'd swapped from Ozempic to Mounjaro, following some unpleasant experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, there's one particular side-effect that has, unsurprisingly, made headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has skyrocketed in popularity and its side-effects have been highlighted by experts (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is 'Ozempic Penis'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;'Ozempic Penis' is the new side-effect that people have been turning their heads at, and users are reporting experiencing some changes to their downstairs area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to claims on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, men have claimed that they've been noticing some improvements in the size of their parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And due to this enlargement, the phenomenon has been coined as 'Ozempic Penis'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While the pharmaceutical company that manufacture Ozempic, Novo Nordisk, have reiterated that the drug should only be used to treat diabetes, people have been using it to shave off the pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This can &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-penis-weight-loss-drug-injection-health-525841-20250617"&gt;come with its negatives&lt;/a&gt; according to a urologist, but a group of users online don't seem to mind much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have people's experiences been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While the medicine doesn't clarify if it enlarges the penis, male users on Reddit have claimed that it might be a positive side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One user claimed that after losing a decent amount of weight, his 'junk definitely looks longer', asking if anyone had gone through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There's no medical evidence backing up the claim, though a healthier heart may contribute to stronger erections, but other users seemed to report the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I used to joke with my wife that this was bulls*** because we would've noticed two extra inches!' Turns out I did get it. It's when I'm flaccid," he claimed, adding that he 'was already pleased' with his size, but has got a 'confidence boost'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A different user, who lost 60lbs over four months, said that his wife 'thinks my penis is larger from the meds', asking if it was an 'unseen side effect'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One female user even chined in, saying: "It does get bigger/more hard with weight loss. I can confirm this with my own husband's weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Different users also reported that either they or their partners' penises got bigger, but how legitimate are these claims?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic penis may be more real than you think (Getty/Nenad Cavoski)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the urologist said?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Urologist Dr Martina Ambardjieva explained to HuffPost UK: “As a urologist, I can say there’s no evidence that semaglutide (Ozempic) or other GLP-1 agonists cause actual penile tissue growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It turns out that it's to do with the perception of the individual's weight-loss, and the weight loss around the stomach area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“When a man loses weight, particularly rapidly as with GLP-1 drugs, this fat pad shrinks, revealing more of the shaft and making the penis appear longer,” she revealed, highlighting that 'it’s not growth, it’s exposure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;An expert in integrative health, Dr Kenneth Lipman, also told the Daily Mail that Ozempic may be getting 'some of the credit' for the gradual increase in average penis size around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What it does do is help men shed belly fat, which can reveal more of the penis. For some, it’s the first time in years they’ve seen it without a mirror," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He also pointed out: "Consider that men just want bigger penises, and they may just be seeing what they want to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;LADbible has reached out to Novo Nordisk for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 12:29:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQTGd2TzFrVEJuREM2NFVmbFZ2OVJZVG1rTzIwMDZMSVBVY2lLQ0dYV0RpTk52cFlVVndLRDh2LVhWdG9TNkNZbFZvSUVLUHlyVGs0YlJCcTlQWUNtdUpEUUJocldwbXpzdnA5Mm43R3p0Wk5scVZUQ1lNWTI4ZTIzTHowUXNVZWw3bWo3QkxIR05HaXRPRW91UjNEcGlCUGVsN19RY1lJb3BTYXZXSzhnUw</guid></item><item><title>游轮乘客和船员中的Clade II Mpox感染—美国， 2024年-疾病控制和预防中心| CDC （ .gov ） | Clade II Mpox Infections Among Cruise Ship Passengers and Crew Members — United States, 2024 - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | CDC (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBkN0tJeGpVUnd6NUVydmphSzdCTjV6WV9TNW9zUnA5Xzc2NlRUMGNNdTkxREVCUW82WG1vYUItVmJXZV8yVVpRc3ZaV2dPWk92V2lISTZ4NDFIS1VtYjZ3bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During January 25–April 18, 2024, CDC was notified of eight mpox infections among cruise travelers on four ships.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Four infections were among crew members, including one three-person cluster. Passenger infections occurred on two cruises marketed to gay and bisexual men. Seven of the eight cases were laboratory-confirmed as clade II &lt;i&gt;Monkeypox virus&lt;/i&gt;, the strain circulating globally (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;); the other case was clinically compatible and met epidemiologic criteria, and therefore was classified as suspected.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; The patients were men aged 30–49 years, most of whom had rash and fever; none were hospitalized, and none died (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Cruise Ship A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 25, 2024, cruise ship A reported three crew members (patients 1–3) with rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and cough to CDC; onset dates spanned January 18–25. On January 31, PCR testing detected orthopoxvirus in all three crew members. CDC confirmed clade II &lt;i&gt;Monkeypox virus&lt;/i&gt; for all specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruise ship A medical personnel isolated patients and interviewed them to ascertain exposures, identify contacts, and categorize their exposure risk. MicrobeTrace (version 9.0; CDC) (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;) was used to visualize the contact-tracing network (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). The network consisted of 19 persons: the index patient (node 1) reported sexual contact** with two partners (nodes 2 and 3), resulting in a three-patient cluster with 16 other contacts (nodes A–P). The second patient (node 2) reported an additional sexual partner (node N). Remaining contacts had nonintimate exposures: seven health care workers (nodes F–L), six of whom (all but node L) were exposed to all patients; four cabinmates (nodes B, C, M, and O); two coworkers (nodes D and E); one friend (node P); and one cabin steward (node A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No crew-member patients with mpox or their contacts had received mpox vaccination as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and none reported being immunocompromised. Cruise ship A procured and offered mpox vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to all identified contacts. Five of 16 received 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine: three health care workers (nodes F, H, and J) and one coworker (node E) received PEP during days 6–9 after exposure. One sexual partner (node N) received PEP 16 days postexposure (2 days beyond the recommended PEP window).&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; Cruise ship A monitored contacts for mpox signs and symptoms until 21 days postexposure; no secondary cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Cruise Ship B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 7, 2024, a health department in the state of Washington notified CDC of a passenger with confirmed clade II mpox (patient 4) who developed symptoms of tenesmus and pruritus ani 2 days after voyaging on a cruise marketed to gay and bisexual men with approximately 5,000 passengers (cruise ship B). Patient 4 reported approximately 50 sexual partners during the voyage. Despite the absence of personally identifying information to fully trace contacts, CDC initiated public health interventions because of concerns about additional exposures. At CDC’s recommendation, the travel company distributed notification letters to all passengers and crew members regarding their &lt;i&gt;Monkeypox virus&lt;/i&gt; exposure risk (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). CDC obtained aggregate counts of the voyage’s passengers by U.S. state or country of residence and sent notifications to 58 U.S. state health jurisdictions via CDC’s Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X)&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; and to 68 countries’ International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Points. In addition, CDC notified the respective IHR National Focal Points for the three countries where cruise ship B had ported. On February 14, 2024, in response to the Epi-X notification, a California health department notified CDC of a second laboratory-confirmed clade II mpox case in a passenger on cruise ship B (patient 5) who experienced a genital rash on the day of disembarkation. Also on February 14, a Florida health department notified CDC of a suspected mpox case also in a cruise ship B passenger (patient 6), who experienced fever, myalgia, general pain, tenesmus, and a rash on the trunk, extremities, and perianal area 3 days after voyaging. Because patient 6’s specimen was not suitable for PCR testing, the case was categorized as suspected. Patients 5 and 6 reported having had 25 and four sexual partners during the voyage, respectively; neither provided personally identifying information for sexual partners. All three passenger patients associated with cruise ship B’s voyage had received 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Cruise Ship C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 26, 2024, a health department in Kentucky notified CDC of a confirmed clade II mpox case (patient 7) in a passenger who had traveled on a cruise marketed to gay and bisexual men with approximately 3,000 passengers (cruise ship C). His symptoms began 10 days after he concluded the voyage, and he reported having approximately 40 sexual partners on board. CDC received notification 31 days after the voyage (i.e., postincubation period). In addition, the notification occurred after the 14-day window for PEP administration. Hence, public health interventions were not initiated. The patient had no history of mpox vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Cruise Ship D&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 18, 2024, a California health department notified CDC of a confirmed clade II mpox case (patient 8) in a crew member on cruise ship D. On March 29, the patient went to the ship medical center with facial and extremity lesions and a history of sexual contact with a male partner before his March 19 ship embarkation; he reported no sexual contact while on board. CDC assisted cruise ship D with the case investigation, contact tracing, and PEP recommendations. Eight exposed crew-member contacts were identified; none reported history of mpox vaccination, and none was immunocompromised. No contacts met high or intermediate exposure risk criteria&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; for mpox; therefore, PEP was not recommended. Contacts were monitored for 21 days, and none developed mpox. Patient 8 reported that mpox vaccine for PrEP was not available in his home country.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that combining exercise with time in nature may offer unique benefits for brain function—benefits that neither exercise nor outdoor exposure alone can fully explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted to explore whether the environment in which children are physically active affects how much their cognitive function improves afterward. Scientists already know that physical activity and time spent in natural settings each support cognitive health. What remained unknown was whether these two factors, when combined, might amplify each other’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies had often looked at either exercise or outdoor time in isolation, or had methodological limitations such as relying on short exercise sessions, limited cognitive tests, or unbalanced activity types. The current study aimed to address those gaps by directly comparing the effects of identical physical activity sessions conducted both indoors and outdoors on children’s cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team from Nottingham Trent University recruited 45 children between the ages of 11 and 13 from two secondary schools in the United Kingdom. Each participant took part in two physical activity sessions: one held indoors and one held outdoors, with the order randomized. The sessions were spaced at least a week apart. Both sessions followed the exact same basketball-based routine, including warm-ups, drills, small games, and cooldowns. Everything was matched across the two settings—from the group size and court dimensions to the equipment and instructor—ensuring that the only major difference was the environment itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before each session, immediately afterward, and again 45 minutes later, the children completed a series of computerized tests that measured different aspects of cognitive function. These included the Stroop test (assessing inhibitory control), the Sternberg paradigm (measuring working memory), and the Flanker task (evaluating attention). The researchers also measured the children’s physical activity levels during each session using heart rate monitors and GPS trackers, and assessed how much they enjoyed each session using a standard questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that performing the physical activity outdoors led to more substantial improvements in several cognitive domains compared to doing the same activity indoors. For example, on the Stroop test’s complex level, children improved their reaction times more after outdoor activity than indoor activity 45 minutes later (94 milliseconds faster versus 20 milliseconds faster). Accuracy on this same task also increased more outdoors than indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns were seen on the working memory test: on both the one-item and three-item versions of the Sternberg paradigm, children responded faster after the outdoor session than after the indoor one. For attention, measured through the Flanker task, reaction times improved more in the outdoor setting on the congruent trials, and accuracy stayed stable outdoors but declined indoors on the more difficult incongruent trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the improved cognitive performance after outdoor activity occurred despite children covering less ground and performing fewer sprints compared to the indoor sessions. However, their average heart rates were higher outdoors, suggesting that the outdoor setting may have naturally encouraged more intense effort. Still, physical exertion alone didn’t fully account for the cognitive benefits, as the children reported similar levels of enjoyment and didn’t show major mood differences between the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that exposure to natural environments may help restore mental energy and improve brain functioning. One explanation for this is known as Attention Restoration Theory, which proposes that natural settings engage the brain in a gentle, non-demanding way, giving it a chance to recover from mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that being in nature reduces stress and improves emotional well-being, which could indirectly support better cognitive performance. However, in this study, the children reported equal levels of enjoyment across both sessions, suggesting that mood effects alone are unlikely to explain the cognitive differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was methodologically strong in several ways. The researchers used a counterbalanced crossover design, which means each child served as their own comparison, reducing the influence of individual differences. All physical activity sessions were standardized, and objective measures of effort and movement were collected. The researchers also tested cognitive function at multiple time points, offering insight into both immediate and short-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study had some limitations. It was conducted in only two relatively rural schools, both of which had access to green outdoor space. The results might be different in urban environments with less greenery or more distractions. The study also focused on a narrow age range, meaning the findings may not apply equally to younger children or older teenagers. Additionally, although physical effort was objectively measured, the study did not assess the children’s subjective perception of how hard they were working, which could offer another layer of understanding in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future studies could explore how the type of outdoor setting—such as a park, wooded area, or urban playground—affects outcomes. They also recommend looking at older adolescents, especially those under high academic pressure, as they may benefit even more from the restorative effects of outdoor physical activity. Incorporating measures of perceived effort alongside enjoyment and objective physical output could also help untangle how different factors interact to influence cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2025.114888" target="_blank"&gt;Outdoor physical activity is more beneficial than indoor physical activity for cognition in young people&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Grace Walters, Karah J.

If a suitable analysis detecting these DNA signatures in the bloodstream can be rolled out at scale, it means a reliable way of catching cancer much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three years earlier provides time for intervention," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2025/06/cancers-can-be-detected-in-the-bloodstream-three-years-prior-to-diagnosis"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yuxuan Wang, an oncology researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. "The tumors are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed blood samples from 26 participants in a wider health study, who were diagnosed with cancer within six months of the sample collection. These samples were compared with blood taken from 26 other individuals who didn't develop cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the test looked for circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. Using a combination of algorithms and multiple cross-checks, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-identified-hundreds-of-genes-that-could-cause-cancer"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt; known to be linked to tumors can be spotted, even though they're rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For eight of the 52 study participants, cancer was flagged by the multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test put together by the researchers – that means nearly 31 percent of those who got cancer were picked up by the blood analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164988" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164988" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DNARendering.jpg" alt="DNA illustration" class="wp-image-164988 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DNARendering.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DNARendering-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164988" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cancer tumors leave DNA fragments. (Josh Hawley/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older samples from 3.1-3.5 years earlier were available for six of those eight people, and of those six, cancer could be detected in four individuals. The same DNA fragments from tumors had already begun to appear, being found at levels up to nearly 80 times lower than those detected by the MCED test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's still plenty of work to be done. The further the samples go back in time, the lower the levels of detectable ctDNA: if we're to spot cancer up to three years in advance, much more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-detects-deadly-brain-cancers-in-just-one-hour"&gt;sensitive blood tests&lt;/a&gt; need to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows the promise of MCED tests in detecting cancers very early, and sets the benchmark sensitivities required for their success," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2025/06/cancers-can-be-detected-in-the-bloodstream-three-years-prior-to-diagnosis"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bert Vogelstein, an oncology researcher at the Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are doing fantastic work at identifying ways to spot cancer early, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-single-blood-test-can-detect-multiple-kinds-of-cancer-early"&gt;through blood tests&lt;/a&gt;. However, getting them successfully through trials and approved by regulators &lt;a href="https://cancerletter.com/clinical/20241025_1/"&gt;remains a challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the hurdles ahead, there are reasons for optimism: each new study showing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-says-a-blood-test-can-find-5-types-of-cancer-before-standard-diagnosis"&gt;early cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; adds to our overall knowledge and understanding of how cancer gets started, and how it can be identified at earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to that the progress that's being made in terms of cancer treatments – including treatments capable of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-compound-could-help-treat-up-a-quarter-of-all-cancers"&gt;attacking multiple cancer types&lt;/a&gt; – and there are good reasons to believe that survival rates can &lt;a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/statistics"&gt;continue to rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Detecting cancers years before their clinical diagnosis could help provide management with a more favorable outcome," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2025/06/cancers-can-be-detected-in-the-bloodstream-three-years-prior-to-diagnosis"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nickolas Papadopoulos, an oncology researcher at the Ludwig Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, we need to determine the appropriate clinical follow-up after a positive test for such cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Murphy added: "The most common practice is using a glucometer, where you prick your finger with a lancet, place a drop of blood on a test strip, and insert it into the meter for reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "For most diabetics, checking levels one to four times a day is common. This is typically before meals and at bedtime, or as advised by your GP."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet plays a vital role in controlling blood sugar levels, including the drinks you consume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Murphy recommends that diabetics "avoid" one seemingly healthy drink; he stated: "Avoid fruit juices."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31882270" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although whole fruits are beneficial due to their essential nutrients and fibre, fruit juices can cause a spike in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes UK, a leading charity, explained that fruit juices "have most of the fibre (roughage) removed when they are made". Therefore, it becomes quite straightforward to consume substantial amounts of the juice quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This means you could be drinking a lot of extra calories, carbs and sugar," the charity cautioned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes UK advised that if one chooses to drink fruit juice, it's wise to drink no more than one small glass (150ml) daily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Make sure your drink goes further by diluting it with water," the organisation advised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wondering if you might have diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Should you notice any of the symptoms listed below, take note and arrange to see your GP:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Urinating more frequently than usual&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Feeling very thirsty&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Feeling extremely tired&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Losing weight without trying to&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Repeatedly getting thrush&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cuts and wounds are taking longer to heal than usual&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPcG81cXpSTmdDZmtRRmFmMVpFaHJBbkk4eE5UOXZsVGVnR2daaXhvVlByanlmUUpjT3BPUV9zZ0xkbWE1ZkJmT3VjcDgzSjFDVGpYR2Iza0ROQVhuNmZfUEhRaFVZZkdwdFRLLTJ1a3p0MGtwRXNQbEl4QXR0eEI5c3pFQWRsNVk</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬被当场抓获偷走妈妈的绘画用品，证据是无价的- PetHelpful | Golden Retriever Caught Red-Handed Stealing Mom's Painting Supplies and the Evidence Is Priceless - PetHelpful</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNTHoyb1RDRzluZUdfTWVSUjJTdklHUXJXWmk1VmZhOUlHM2piWkplLUdTQXI3bnFqSTNGUENoZ014VGRDUG84Wmg3Zkp3TmtIWE5nb1ZOWkMxYklRNUhEQndLRGxXSlJsNFVZN2IzRV9Bakp3QTdwdHJNanhVaElHdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNTHoyb1RDRzluZUdfTWVSUjJTdklHUXJXWmk1VmZhOUlHM2piWkplLUdTQXI3bnFqSTNGUENoZ014VGRDUG84Wmg3Zkp3TmtIWE5nb1ZOWkMxYklRNUhEQndLRGxXSlJsNFVZN2IzRV9Bakp3QTdwdHJNanhVaElHdQ</guid></item><item><title>这个简单的健身测试可以预测您的寿命-《华盛顿邮报》 | This simple fitness test might predict how long you’ll live - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQYzc0TVJjQ2dDNlozMU8wc1h5T0JfeVdURGNxYnFLZ21XMzk3RFU5M0hxX1R4bUlWUmdkbEQ2d01CdER1WncwLWpsdjgyaXhEaG1rSTFrSFVoNVhYTGtWVERqVW5wWWRmRHJsQ2FUMUx2RlJnNVdwam9PbGhETGdQQmNlU3VPQlpv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XF433F5UTFEZ5GNPFK5PSGVIJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A simple test of your balance, strength and flexibility, known as the sitting-rising test, could be an early indicator of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/08/death-clock-ai-life-expectancy/" target="_blank"&gt;how long you’ll live&lt;/a&gt;, according to a large-scale new study of mobility and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IPF3A5537FCJPKWC6UNYLSPHRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study, published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf325" target="_blank"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, looked at how well 4,282 men and women aged between 46 and 75 could lower themselves from a standing position to the floor and then stand back up again with as little assistance as possible from their hands, knees, furniture or human helpers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MPFSMEBR25H2NMLOARRC7YPDVM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The test assesses “all the aspects of fitness that are not aerobic,” said Claudio Gil Araújo, the study’s lead author and research director at an exercise-medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, where the data were collected. Those aspects include muscular health, balance, flexibility and body composition, he said, each of which is important for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/06/cellular-reprogramming-longevity-reverse-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;longevity and health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCKKYEJ2EZCMVK4HM4XTWPRHM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study, middle-aged and older people who needed no support to sit or stand were about six times less likely to die of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/24/heart-disease-strokes-cardiovascular-death/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and other cardiovascular conditions during the next decade or so than people who wobbled and had great difficulty completing the task.

First find a partner. “Don’t do this test on your own,” Araújo said. Your partner will watch you, score your test and, most important, steady you if you start to topple. (If you have disabilities or serious joint problems, such as hip, spine or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/20/strength-training-arthritis-risk-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, you probably shouldn’t do the test, Araújo said, since it could cause unnecessary pain or injury.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="IZJZQRG63VEOFGUB57FSRYYGBE" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clear a level space so you have room to maneuver but also, if needed, still have a wall, chair or other support nearby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the floor is bare, put down a pad in case you land with a thump while sitting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remove your shoes and socks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stand with your feet slightly apart, then cross one foot in front of the other.

It incorporates so many aspects of fitness, for one thing, it’s hard to know which are weakest if our scores are low, said Avril Mansfield, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Toronto, who studies mobility and balance. She wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KMWYMHM7ZREHHFMB6MUZTGM2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is the problem mostly our flexibility, strength, range of motion, balance or some combination of several of those? “Working with a professional like a physiotherapist or a clinical exercise specialist could help you identify the specific physical limitations” that are impairing your score, she said, “and design an exercise program to address those limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OJG6D6P7JENHEFJKV57FGWUT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This test also could be daunting or inappropriate for many people, said Lora Giangregorio, a professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada who studies falls and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/17/bone-health-osteoporosis-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and wasn’t involved with the study. “It requires people to get off of the floor in a prescribed way that requires very good joint mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VNFXWJSC35F6VNYKITNBY2SESU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/arthritis-joint-pain-remedies/2020/10/16/5c1beab0-08a2-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint pain&lt;/a&gt; or other disabilities or are older and feel infirm, other tests of mobility are likely to be safer and more reliable, she said. Try, for instance, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/157303" target="_blank"&gt;the 30-second chair stand test&lt;/a&gt;, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to assess physical performance in older people, she said. Simply count how many times you can rise from and sit back onto a chair seat in 30 seconds, without using your hands. Men younger than 60 should manage, at minimum, 15 and women that age at least 13. Average scores decline by one or two per decade after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SGSRUWU4GZC6NE4IS7GHCJO4XU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The sitting-rising test and the new study also don’t tell us why the test predicts mortality, although Araújo believes low scores indicate underlying disease and frailty. People who are inflexible also often have stiff arteries, he said, contributing to heart disease, while people with poor balance could be predisposed to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/09/fall-risk-older-adults-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;serious falls&lt;/a&gt;, which can precipitate physical decline and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EIOTMPFAWZC75K4U45ESJ6BZLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important, though, a low score is a portent, but not a promise, he said. “People ask me all the time, ‘If my score is low, does that mean I’ll be dead in five years?’ I tell them, ‘Of course not,’” Araújo said. But it can be a wake-up call, he added. “It’s telling you, maybe you need to make some changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:14:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQYzc0TVJjQ2dDNlozMU8wc1h5T0JfeVdURGNxYnFLZ21XMzk3RFU5M0hxX1R4bUlWUmdkbEQ2d01CdER1WncwLWpsdjgyaXhEaG1rSTFrSFVoNVhYTGtWVERqVW5wWWRmRHJsQ2FUMUx2RlJnNVdwam9PbGhETGdQQmNlU3VPQlpv</guid></item><item><title>专家对可能致命的真菌发出警报，这些真菌听起来直接来自“最后的生命” ： “我们谈论的是数十万人的生命” -雅虎 | Experts sound alarm over potentially lethal fungus that sounds straight out of 'The Last of Us': 'We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNMkJlT0VzaU9paUw4bEJjWXVVbGhzUTdud1BwdkxMTGE3SVJSdXhZS19sMnJmazVxQkFpaXZuMERpQ3BXREdOenIwVWlkbml3dXNfS0xNQ2xMM2dvWUEtc2tDV296QWxCTkJ5SjJfVUExMkZmLVdTdExFb0E1RE5NdVhaXzI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A potentially lethal group of fungi called Aspergillus could spread worldwide, with the possibility of northerly shifts to parts of Europe, Asia, and the Americas. New research suggests that rising global temperatures may drive the health hazard to previously under-exposed regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the Financial Times &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/506f5a03-8520-40e1-aee3-a6e6427f68c0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in early May, researchers from the United Kingdom have a preprint up at Research Square that shows how the prevalence of a potential killer fungus could increase due to human-caused climate change. A warming planet is set to accelerate fungal growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the surface, the threat sounds like something you'd watch in an apocalyptic TV series. In fact, a sensationalized brain-infecting fungus zombifies and wipes out most of the population in the video game and HBO show "The Last of Us," though that series is based on another type of fungus called Ophiocordyceps that actually has various species that specialize in taking over the brain of specific insects and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is, fortunately, no species of Ophiocordyceps that targets humans, but Aspergillus is a real concern for people around the world and not a fictional creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The spores can cause aspergillosis, affecting especially the lungs but also potentially the brain. When infections occur, mortality rates can be high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions," &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preprint;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; co-author Norman van Rhijn, from the University of Manchester, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/506f5a03-8520-40e1-aee3-a6e6427f68c0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Financial Times.

The steady overheating of our planet and resulting sea level rise, stemming from the use of dirty energy sources, may be creating the ideal circumstances for infections to spread into previously unaffected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have been warning the public about the global health catastrophes that could be on the horizon due to the potential for an explosion in fungal pathogens. Although microscopic, out-of-control fungi can pose significant threats to wellness and safety. People with compromised immune systems and preexisting conditions are often at the most risk of severe complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And not only do warmer temps and wetter surroundings sponsor fungal growth but also other extreme weather events. &lt;a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/articles/spotlight/research/deadly-fungi-toxic-tides-and-wildfire-smoke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wildfires can exacerbate exposures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Wildfires can exacerbate exposures&lt;/a&gt;, disturbing soil habitats and aerosolizing spores in smoke. Following droughts and subsequent heavy rainfall, spores can be released into the air and inhaled in nearby communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, significant upticks in infection can drive resistance to treatments, which could leave vulnerable populations even more desperate. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/24/climate/deadly-fungi-aspergillus-spread" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; recent reporting from CNN, the World Health Organization "added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The outlet noted that the strain can also infect and destroy crops, jeopardizing food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done to prevent and prepare for fungal threats?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists are working to understand fungal pathogens through initiatives like a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/506f5a03-8520-40e1-aee3-a6e6427f68c0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:five-year project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;five-year project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Berkeley, which seeks to uncover factors that can affect the occurrence and severity of fungal infections. Research is also underway to reduce their spread and strengthen food security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The WHO issued a new report in April &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:indicating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;indicating&lt;/a&gt; the need for faster, more reliable, and cheaper testing methods, particularly in low- in middle-income countries, where fungal threats are an especially troublesome public health concern. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/24/climate/deadly-fungi-aspergillus-spread" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Supporting pro-environment policies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Supporting pro-environment policies&lt;/a&gt; that not only invest in research and development to address these threats but also prioritize and center the marginalized groups disproportionately impacted by fungal infections will be key to meaningful solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fungal spread could be managed in residential areas with natural fungicides. And at home, individuals can reduce some risks by practicing hygiene, properly drying skin, and strengthening their immune systems to fight infection. But since Aspergillus and other fungi could continue to pose global threats, it's global health solutions — including the mitigation of human-caused climate change — that will be most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?recrFYLvD9xpum9Dp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNMkJlT0VzaU9paUw4bEJjWXVVbGhzUTdud1BwdkxMTGE3SVJSdXhZS19sMnJmazVxQkFpaXZuMERpQ3BXREdOenIwVWlkbml3dXNfS0xNQ2xMM2dvWUEtc2tDV296QWxCTkJ5SjJfVUExMkZmLVdTdExFb0E1RE5NdVhaXzI</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明运动如何保护大脑免受阿尔茨海默病的影响-今日医学新闻 | New study shows how exercise protects the brain from Alzheimer’s disease - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNMGRsanlDX1RUZW1Jd1BFdHdsb05HVTBBTElMRy1fX0tUSzFXaUJVVjNqTzJvRHlGS3FLUk5Wd1JVOG1aN0xPeDRkRDJzeW8xRTRfQ19LR3RMODUycHYxYjRwNGZGbFRaRC04VmtvV0ZDNmxpY1hzVGlEZ1VKcmZLRnBIV0lrbkZTOTB6NFZqbUZHNDdjbm9Ed25JN1JzWko1NEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/Activity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/Activity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/Activity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/Activity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="An older adult runs up stairs outside in running gear" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fstudy-how-exercise-protects-brain-alzheimers-disease-aging&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2FActivity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Alzheimer's%3A%20How%20does%20exercise%20protect%20the%20brain%20as%20people%20age%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/Activity-Brain-Stocksy_txpdfe9a8d1Yd8400_Medium_2918681-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;A new study aims to explain exercise’s protective effect on the brain from neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

Thus, these results further elucidate the link between heightened brain inflammation and cognitive decline,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brain health has a strong influence on our quality of life. Cognitive decline affects not just the physical and behavioral health of the patient, but also has an impact on their caregivers and all who care about the person. The bottom line is that dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are not inevitable parts of aging. We can take steps to reduce the risk through lifestyle habits. And even for those who develop the disease, making changes in diet, physical activity, and stress management can slow the progression and extend the time when a person can enjoy a fulfilling quality of life.” &lt;br&gt;— Gary Small, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more we understand how cognitive decline occurs, and what can change the course of its development and progression, the more opportunities there are to find ways to treat it,” Small added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:36:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNMGRsanlDX1RUZW1Jd1BFdHdsb05HVTBBTElMRy1fX0tUSzFXaUJVVjNqTzJvRHlGS3FLUk5Wd1JVOG1aN0xPeDRkRDJzeW8xRTRfQ19LR3RMODUycHYxYjRwNGZGbFRaRC04VmtvV0ZDNmxpY1hzVGlEZ1VKcmZLRnBIV0lrbkZTOTB6NFZqbUZHNDdjbm9Ed25JN1JzWko1NEE</guid></item><item><title>科学表明，这种锻炼可以使您的身体年轻8岁。培训师讲解如何做到这一点-女性健康 | Science Says This Workout Can Make Your Body 8 Years Younger.

(Telomeres help prevent your DNA from getting damaged, among other things, and are usually measured in biological aging.) The participants were also asked how often they worked out, including how often they did strength training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, the researchers discovered that doing 90 minutes a week of strength training was linked with nearly four years less biological aging. Meaning, if you did 180 minutes a week of strength training, you could cut your biological age by up to eight years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-takeaways-from-the-findings" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;What are the takeaways from the findings? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The findings actually line up well with current exercise guidelines in the U.S. The current &lt;a href="https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week, with at least two days of muscle-strengthening activity in the mix weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s the link with aging? The researchers broke it down in the study, noting that strength training “mitigates some of the damage caused by such chronic diseases, reversing muscle loss, raising resting metabolic rate, promoting fat loss, and improving cardiovascular health.” As a result, it may “limit disease and slow the aging of cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-14"

data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SoHo Strength Lab" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;, points out that this was all self-reported, meaning there’s a chance that some people may have fudged or exaggerated how much lifting they actually do. There always wasn’t a specific weight-lifting protocol, leaving plenty of room for variation here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But the study found that more is better when it comes to weight lifting and telomere length. “More hours are most correlated to the longest telomere length,” Matheny says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-easiest-ways-to-start-strength-training" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;What are the easiest ways to start strength training? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="easy-ways-to-start-strength-training" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’ve never picked up a set of weights, it’s understandable to feel a little intimidated by it. But Matheny says it’s possible to get an easy-to-follow routine started without equipment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“You don’t need weights beyond body weight to start strength training,” Matheny says. “Start with body weight stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;He suggests starting your routine by focusing on larger muscle groups, like your legs and glutes. That means doing things like lunges, squats, walking lunges, step-ups, and step-back lunges. “Those are the easiest things to do that recruit large muscle groups,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To work your upper body, try push-ups and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64242460/ultimate-pull-up-plan/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64242460/ultimate-pull-up-plan/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pull-ups" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;pull-ups&lt;/a&gt;. “For &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a20702206/how-to-pushup/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a20702206/how-to-pushup/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="push-ups" data-node-id="22.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt;, you can start with a plank—that is strength training,” Matheny says. You can do kneeling push-ups if a full push-up feels like too much. “For pull-ups you can use a band [for assistance] and work your way up,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To challenge yourself, simply add more reps, step higher, or use less aids to get the full body resistance, Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“When you’ve tapped out on that, start adding some weights,” Matheny says. “Then, ideally, you get to the gym.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="25" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-q3lsei e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get Stronger With A WH+ Workout Plan&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-1cav9c0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

						West Nile virus has been detected in mosquitoes in Massachusetts for the first time this year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced Tuesday.The presence of the virus was in a mosquito sample collected on Saturday in Shrewsbury.“Mid-June is earlier than we typically first find West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes in Massachusetts. WNV activity is very difficult to predict in advance, which is why the mosquito surveillance system is so important,” said Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein.The virus is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. There were 19 human cases of West Nile virus in 2024. Last year, the virus was first detected in mosquito samples collected in late June. No human or animal cases of West Nile virus have been detected so far this year. At this time, there is no evidence of Eastern equine encephalitis, another arbovirus that occurs sporadically in Massachusetts. There were four human cases of EEE in 2024.While West Nile virus can infect people of all ages, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for severe disease. Most people infected will have no symptoms. Symptoms tend to include fever and flu-like illness. In rare cases, more severe illness can occur.

His collarbone&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had snapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NDMFAU3X2RD33K4MO7FQP34SHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In early June, a scan revealed that the cancer that started in his tonsils was racing through his bones. That day, he&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;called a medical team at the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/03/05/nih-trump-turmoil-grants/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; that had created an experimental cell therapy, custom-made to attack his cancer as part of a clinical trial.

Bhattacharya said on X that objections raised in a document called the Bethesda Declaration contained &lt;a href="https://x.com/NIHDirector_Jay/status/1932137905939431769"&gt;“fundamental misconceptions”&lt;/a&gt; about NIH’s new direction. Each &lt;a href="https://x.com/NIHDirector_Jay/status/1932137914143473689"&gt;termination &lt;/a&gt;was being reviewed, and some workers were reinstated, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EVQEFDWQ35EIDDQOFKR5YMX6T4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Schlueters had a front-row seat to the effects of the job losses. Richard’s therapy was in a freezer, nearly ready to go. All along, they had been told the final step of preparation takes three to four weeks. But on June 3, his NIH doctor informed him that it would now take eight to 10 weeks because of cuts to essential lab personnel — a painful illustration of the life-and-death stakes of the administration’s approach to shrinking the government workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RPVOBV2JOBD5VNPSBBX6GR7IPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m petrified.

Two highly skilled technicians who prepared cells for treatments were fired in the probationary purge in February, according to Steven Rosenberg, an NIH immunotherapy pioneer who leads multiple trials. He declined to say how many patients were affected, but his team now treats one patient per week, down from two or three before the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OXRUKAHA5ZGJ7PYN7RQAAASQSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are some patients who might have to wait until September,” Rosenberg said. “These are all patients with metastatic cancer that is progressive. You can imagine the difficulty as we have to tell them these things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4E5B7UQ63NANPFGSE5VSUPUXQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An official with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, said the agency had ways of addressing the delays. Rosenberg has been granted permission to hire contractors or to request help from other scientists from across NIH, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to criticize an employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HXII36IIINENHJZSKDY75VKMNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rosenberg said he has been working urgently to try to rehire a scientist who was fired since he was given permission to do so last week, but the federal contracting process is slow and the scientist has been interviewing for other jobs. He noted that to prepare the cells for patients requires special training that takes four to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="E67KUXIYENGAHLOK3TPTHTXDGI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="E67KUXIYENGAHLOK3TPTHTXDGI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;National Institutes of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKHVOVZ26NEC7HN34G4QCRN3IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Richard’s cancer nightmare started with what he thought was acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5K7C5KKVNBFLL63YKLDVAF2PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few weeks after his annual physical in January 2024, he noticed a metallic taste in the back of his throat. Looking in the bathroom mirror, he saw little white pustules on one of his tonsils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDYCZPHSFREGFNL5CWW22NU6J4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A scan and biopsy showed it was head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but an oncologist told him it was treatable, with an excellent chance of success.

He had always taken good care of his health and was diligent with his treatments. But a scan in July revealed that the cancer had spread to his lungs and part of his chest cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XMYT3XNVK5ESNOLX7TGJ6RQLXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was heart-wrenching, and it was difficult,” said Richard, a founding partner of an Atlanta law firm. “I’m a fact-finder, and I spend a lot of time researching and trying to find a path to remission or a potential cure. And it’s a pretty bleak outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VI3NSCQUVRAVPCTQB5XW6327WI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Richard’s efforts led him to NIH, where he felt blessed to qualify for a trial led by Rosenberg. Doctors would take a biopsy of his cancer and find and isolate immune cells called TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. They would use lab tests to select the cells that recognized Richard’s cancer and expand the population. Then, they would reinfuse them into his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DEIIPXFS4FBURITQ4NP3NUDDWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are no guarantees with clinical research. Patients who qualify for the trial have exhausted standard treatments. But it gave the Schlueters something they had been missing: hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJZNAAPJ3ZDGFJ4U7PNPC6EN6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Patients often refer to us not as the National Institutes of Health, but the National Institutes of Hope,” Rosenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5BMEE6L5RF5FK3H2E6IMSTE7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In January, Richard went to NIH for surgery to remove two tumors in his lungs and begin the process of isolating and testing the TIL cells. He read the NIH credo — to improve the human condition throughout the world — emblazoned on a wall of the Clinical Center and was so moved that he sent a photo of it to his three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RIWPPSJKSFEJPFELNWJJOJVF4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The staff, the physicians, the amount of empathy, care and mission that I’ve experienced over four visits to their research hospital has been just super gratifying,” Richard said. “In many ways, I’m a guinea pig that may be helping other people.

He was running, swimming, biking and lifting weights.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The only sign something was awry was a red rash on his face that resembled&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a sunburn, a side effect of one of his treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GBCULZ23JDOPPAMCDWSIVYO6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But as the cancer has spread through his bones, his arms have become weak, and he has a suspected microfracture in his right arm.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd5wc001f3b77k4j0x8ta@published"&gt;My ex is hurting our daughter with her coddling. Our daughter is nearly 9 and can’t swim, sleep by herself, ride a bike, or even pour herself a bowl of cereal. Her mother does all of it. She claims our daughter needs her to do all this, and she will magically be able to do it all when she gets older. My daughter used to be outgoing and adventurous, but now she is afraid of her own shadow and prone to meltdowns when you push her out of her comfort zone. I do my best to teach her and encourage her, but it is always one step forward and three back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="173" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzjxrm900053b78xmpip83t@published"&gt;I have signed her up for lessons, and her mother refused to take her on her days. My ex had her remote position terminated and now has to go into the office. By some small miracle, I was able to get my daughter into a local day camp. It is barely the start of the summer, and we already have trouble. During my week, my daughter gets afraid and fussy, but ends up really enjoying the camp and making friends. When it is her mother’s turn, she has full meltdowns and needs to be picked up early. My ex says this is proof that the camp is “too much” for our daughter, and the solution should be that my wife watches her since she works remotely. My wife works on contract and is pregnant. She flatly said that my ex is out of bounds and she isn’t going to parent my daughter without me around. I feel like I am caught between a rock and a hard place. What do I do here?&lt;/p&gt;

You have decided not to push for full custody of your daughter despite your wife’s stance. You know that she is safe and healthy at your ex’s home. How great for you. Your kid is being coddled, but she’s not being abused, neglected, or scarred. She gets a lot of help and nurturing. Is she behind other kids her age when it comes to independence? It sure sounds like it. But luckily, there’s no plan to send her out in the world to fend for herself or be dropped into the ocean and have to swim to safety in the next few years, right? What’s your biggest fear about the consequences of the way she’s being parented right now? Is it rational?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd64u001j3b77tbpojpdn@published"&gt;I also think you should explore the possibility that her regression and her emotional fragility may have something to do with her parents’ divorce, including whatever experiences led up to that, in addition to her mom’s parenting style. If I were in her position—a sensitive kid who’s been through a tough time and who is a bit younger for my age than my peers—what I’d want from my dad would be acceptance, patience, and encouragement, not the message that I was horribly flawed because of the way I was being raised.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzk3hx0000d3b78947athr8@published"&gt;So when she is with you (I can’t tell how often that is), please don’t give the impression that you’re alarmed by how terribly she’s doing or reveal that you think her mother is the worst. Offer her opportunities to experiment with more independence in low-pressure ways. Set her up to do small tasks on her own and celebrate when she succeeds. Create a fun room for her and see if she’s excited about sleeping on her own there. Look for any chance to tell her that you think she’s very smart and capable and that you trust her. If you must panic about her being behind on bike riding, do it in private.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s painful, embarrassing, sometimes restricts physical movement, and treating symptoms is expensive. It’s not well understood, but doctors have told me my best chance of avoiding it is keeping a low BMI. So, I eat very carefully and maintain a strict exercise schedule, and keep my BMI at 19. Even during pregnancy, I was very careful (hormonal shifts like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause are potential triggers), and so far, I’ve dodged this bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6bx001m3b77bcgfxd2w@published"&gt;My husband and I have a blended family. We have full custody of 10-year-old “Katherine,” but we also have a child together, 6-year-old “Delilah.” I consider them both my kids in every way that matters. I try to make sure that I don’t treat them differently and that I teach them the skills they need to be healthy. But as puberty approaches, I’m realizing that I have no idea how to talk about food and eating. With both kids, I’ve always talked about eating when we’re hungry and stopping when we’re full, and eating lots of different foods. They have treats, but we try to make that normal, too. I say this stuff, but my husband is the only one who actually sets a physical example because I need to keep my weight low. With Kathine, I’ve emphasized self-confidence with her changing body and encouraged her to recognize that body shape can do all kinds of things during puberty, and it’s all normal and OK, even if it feels scary.&lt;/p&gt;

I could take the same route with both kids, and open Delilah up to an unknown amount of health risk. Or I could encourage her to be careful with her weight at puberty, which also feels risky for different reasons. My husband wants to just pretend it’s never going to be a problem, and I have no idea where or how to get advice. Lipedema isn’t researched much in the U.S., and her pediatrician told me it was “just obesity by another name” when I asked for guidance. But I’ve seen my mom and sister both have so much pain and distress from it, and I don’t want that for my kid. Where can I get help?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6ja001q3b77oxatgmvh@published"&gt;If only maintaining a low BMI were as easy as being told by your mom, “Be careful with your weight!” and replying with, “OK!” If that were the case, people of all ages wouldn’t be at war with their bodies, and there wouldn’t be a multimillion dollar diet and fitness industry designed to help people, who, despite their best intentions, can’t crack the code of eating and working out in a way that leads to the body size they so badly want. I really want to question the assumption that informing her about the need to keep her weight low would actually lead to her doing so. Beyond that, I worry that putting the idea of restriction into Delilah’s head might backfire and lead to her experiencing shame, or feeling rebellious, and developing an unhealthy relationship with food. (I recently &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/06/advice-family-body-image-comments-food.html"&gt;spoke to a few experts who went into detail&lt;/a&gt; about how dangerous these body image issues can be.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6l9001r3b7760wqcsn4@published"&gt;I appreciate what you’re doing by trying to give both girls healthy messages about food. But I think you should pull back on hitting them over the head with, “Treats are OK! Try to feel confident in your changing body! It’s normal!” Kids pay more attention to what you do than what you say. You don’t have to &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;any particular kind of eating to be a good example. But you could show through your actions that there are more interesting things to focus on than how much healthy or unhealthy food you’ve had, or what your body looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6n6001s3b77usgrhbi9@published"&gt;When it comes to giving direct instructions to Delilah, you could choose a topic like the importance of finding a doctor whom she trusts, refusing to accept being dismissed or having her symptoms minimized, and staying aware that not every medical professional will be well informed about the latest research or thinking surrounding specific conditions. I’m seeing that there are conferences and associations dedicated to sharing information about living with and treating lipedema. Maybe you could invite her to join you, in an age-appropriate way, as you tap into these resources. “You deserve excellent health care from someone who listens to you, and we’re going to stay up to date on the latest research on this condition” is a better message than “Make sure you don’t gain too much weight or you may develop this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6pr001t3b77dovdause@published"&gt;The other thing that could benefit Delilah is your transparency about the dilemma in your letter. I’m thinking of something like, “I’ve been stressing about telling you how I’ve been advised to keep this condition at bay by maintaining a low BMI without giving you a complex. I want both you and your sister to have a relaxed, pleasant relationship with food and your bodies. How do you think I’ve been doing when it comes to not promoting weird messages about weight? Please let me know.” This could create some distance from the topic and could make her think, “This is exactly what my mom wanted to avoid,” if she notices herself slipping into restrictive habits. It also communicates your actual values: “I want you to be OK in terms of avoiding this debilitating condition, but I also want you to be OK when it comes to your everyday feelings about food and your body.” She can join you on the journey to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

A few weeks ago, she came to me in tears because she discovered he had spent nearly $1,000 on adult entertainment, leaving them with no money to buy groceries or diapers for the baby, and neither of them was getting paid for two weeks. I purchased what she needed and dropped it off instead of giving her the money to make sure he wouldn’t wouldn’t blow it on more porn. This is not the first time Mandy has come to me in desperation because he’s wasted their money on getting himself off. Unfortunately, she also has two kids with him, both under the age of 4. Trying to convince her to leave him on previous occasions has gone nowhere, but I am hoping this will be a wake-up call for her. Her mother and I talked it over, and we would be prepared to let her and the kids live with us for as long as she needs to if she tells the lout to piss off once and for all. Would making this offer to her be a good idea so she can rebuild her life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 31-year-old woman in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient had a history of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mild learning difficulties and end-stage kidney failure. For the last condition, she was receiving &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14618-dialysis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14618-dialysis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dialysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treatment fills in for the kidneys by clearing waste and excess fluid from the bloodstream, and patients are advised to restrict their fluid and salt intake between sessions. If they don't, fluid can build up in the body because the kidneys aren't filtering it out of the blood, leading to weight gain and strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the woman consistently experienced this excessive fluid buildup between appointments, "despite several interventions" aimed at helping her manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;Over time, the patient could no longer tolerate long dialysis sessions, so she would start and end each session above her target weight due to all the fluid buildup. She also reported experiencing occasional constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one dialysis session, a nurse cleaning the chair the woman had been sitting in noted that it felt "rather light." Upon inspection, she noted large chunks of foam — specifically low-density polyurethane foam — were missing from the chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman's medical team discovered this was a case of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22944-pica" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22944-pica" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pica&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which people develop a habit or compulsion to eat non-food items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to discover that our patient had been eating the foam and had increased her fluid intake with the assumption that it would absorb excess water in the stomach and thus prevent systemic absorption," her doctors &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028043/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028043/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "This was evidently not the case." In other words, she hoped the foam would act like a sponge and soak up the excess fluid she was retaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pica is sometimes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532242/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532242/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;associated with nutrient deficiencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as a lack of iron or zinc, leading some scientists to theorize that these deficiencies lead to unusual cravings. Alternatively, some think that people with pica may be drawn to the sensations — the tastes, textures or smells — of non-food substances. The condition is sometimes associated with pregnancy or sickle cell anemia, as well as certain mental health disorders and medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the woman’s doctors ran tests and ruled out nutritional deficiencies as a factor. They also didn't uncover any "acute psychosocial triggers for her behaviour," and she had no past history of pica. They suspected that her known learning difficulties may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient was advised about the consequences of eating foam and received regular guidance from a dietitian with a speciality in helping patients with kidney dysfunction. Her family also became more closely involved in her treatment. Other cases of pica are typically treated with behavioral therapies, but the case report didn't note whether any such options were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She additionally received a laxative treatment to help her pass the foam she'd already eaten without any complications. At the time the case report was published in 2010, she was continuing to undergo dialysis three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Cases of pica have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051227699900171" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051227699900171" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been reported among kidney disease patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but they typically involve patients craving and eating clay, dirt, aspirin, flour, baking soda or ice. The effects can range from benign to severe; in the latter case, a person may experience toxic effects, dental problems, bowel obstruction or malnutrition, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman's doctors searched the medical literature for cases of kidney disease patients eating polyurethane foam and didn't find any, but they did find a few cases of people without renal disease eating the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case highlights a recognised but under-diagnosed phenomenon in renal patients, known as pica," the doctors wrote. "While the ingestion of ice, aspirin, clay and baking soda has been reported in haemodialysis patients, this case is unique in that the patient resorted to eating foam from her dialysis chair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8-lBpljchRsevC1R8jMWh6LK3IimgVePQB" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8-lBpljchRsevC1R8jMWh6LK3IimgVePQB slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? &lt;a href="#Section1"&gt;Let us know!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the Philadelphia Foundation has funded local community health work and research — everything from research into incurable diseases like &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/three-local-med-students-are-inaugural-brody-fellowship-recipients/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.philafound.org/community-causes/lgbtq/"&gt;affordable housing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just recently started going through applications for one of their grant programs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the usual 60 applications, it got 171, chief impact officer Philip Fitzgerald said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a shock to all of us,” he said.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He said he cannot say for sure why the foundation got three times the usual number of applications, but the amount of money it can give out in grants has not increased by three times, so the foundation has to think especially carefully about how to make the biggest impact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of research grants from the National Institutes of Health that had already been vetted and approved,&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833880?guestAccessKey=3a432109-6c9d-4ef2-9d10-bf48d91fe441&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=050825"&gt; cutting more than a billion dollars&lt;/a&gt; in funding. This also means &lt;a href="https://archive.is/j93vV"&gt;more competition&lt;/a&gt; for other sources of research funding, like from private foundations and charities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Philadelphia Foundation’s programs, the &lt;a href="https://www.philafound.org/philadelphia-foundation-announces-2025-brody-fellows/"&gt;Brody Family Medical Trust Fund fellowship&lt;/a&gt;, pays for local research into incurable diseases. Virologist &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9809086"&gt;Helena Winstone&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pennsylvania recently got one of the fellowships and said it was a “massive relief” to know that her work will be funded for two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A mix of relief and a little bit of guilt as well because I have colleagues … friends who are in the same position as me, but are really, really worried about their funding situation. I’ve had friends (whose) grants have been pulled,” she said. “There’s so many people who are being really, really screwed over by this situation.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winstone’s work is on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mers/about/index.html"&gt;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the same family of viruses as the one that causes COVID-19. However, the MERS coronavirus has a much higher mortality rate — &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers#tab=tab_2"&gt;approximately 35% of victims&lt;/a&gt; have died — and there is no approved treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus circulates among camels in Africa without causing outbreaks, and Winstone wants to figure out if there is a tipping point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already know that they don’t replicate that well in human cells … but we want to know what’s the limit; what’s going to stop them from spilling over.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that in the next two years, she will study how this virus behaves in human, bat and camel cells, and she hopes that will lead to treatments and pandemic preparedness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Foundation’s Brody Trust fellowship also paid for two years of research from neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://goldbergneurolab.com/people/"&gt;Sophie Hill&lt;/a&gt;, who is at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania. She studies the genetic mutations that cause epilepsy. The hope is that understanding how the mutations and disease works can someday lead to a cure.

Medical Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-63b39120-4bbd-11f0-8f7b-13970b7cd649" class=""&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; said: 'Plastic pollution is not just an environmental issue – it may also be a public health issue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics include all plastic particles less than five millimeters in size, which is the width of a pencil eraser or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particles smaller than the human eye come from decomposing plastic waste like bottles, synthetic clothes, personal care products, and countless other manufactured goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe microplastics from polluted oceans make their way into drinking water, seafood, and even the air, eventually consumed by people, which they theorize can increase harmful levels of inflammation and cause numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have found higher rates of coronary artery disease along America's coastal counties with the highest levels of plastic pollution in the ocean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly 100 million people live along the US coastlines, which include heavily polluted waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are more than 250 coastal counties along the US mainland, which are home to over 94 million people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct their study, Ganatra and his team examined 152 US coastal counties along the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of America (formerly the Gulf of Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They collected data on microplastic levels in ocean waters within 200 nautical miles of these counties between 2015 and 2020, using information from the National Centers for Environmental Information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sorted the counties into four groups based on the amount of microplastics in the water: low (almost no plastics), medium (up to one small particle per 200 bathtubs of water), high (a handful of particles per bathtub), and very high (10 or more particles per bathtub).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even in health care – a field devoted to healing – we rely heavily on single-use plastics. Much of it ends up in landfills or the ocean, where it fragments into microplastics and enters the ecosystem,' Ganatra explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then used health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gathered between 2015 and 2020, to look up the rates of Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries), and stroke in these counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They adjusted for factors like age, gender, income, access to doctors, air pollution, and neighborhood conditions, ensuring the results weren't skewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed a clear pattern: counties with very high microplastic pollution in nearby ocean waters had significantly higher rates of health problems that have been linked to an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(23)00223-1/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; has shown that a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis can significantly reduce someone's life expectancy, shaving off more than a decade for people who develop the disease in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The rate of stroke incidents was 9 percent higher in US coastal counties with heavily polluted ocean waters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters in size, while nanoplastics are even smaller, less than 100 nanometers - less than the size of a human hair. Both have been linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognitive issues, and reproductive problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the World Health Organization, stroke survivors may die between five and 10 years earlier than the average person who never had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/26/2_suppl/25/5925419"&gt;researchers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; have found that coronary artery disease is linked to a significant drop in life expectancy, with middle-aged adults losing five to eight years of life due to their higher risk for heart attacks and sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/living-near-an-ocean-polluted-by-microplastics-may-increase-cardiometabolic-disease-risk?preview=4be0&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; has its limitations. It only looked at county-level data, not individual people, so it can't prove that microplastics directly cause these health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also didn't measure microplastics in people's bodies or pinpoint exactly how they enter the body, whether through water, food, or the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the study focused on ocean water pollution, not other sources like fish or plants, which come from the sea and have been shown to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14239717/The-10-foods-high-cancer-causing-microplastics-easy-swaps-avoid-them.html"&gt;full of plastic particles as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the drawbacks, Ganatra contended that the results show a clear connection between the world's growing plastic crisis and rising rates of poor health and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study adds to a growing body of evidence that the garbage we discard into the environment often finds its way back to us,' the study's senior author said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also linked microplastic contamination in the human body to conditions like dementia, infertility, eczema, premature aging, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous studies in mice have linked nanoplastics (plastic particles that are even smaller than microplastics) in the brain to cognitive changes, Parkinson's disease, and some types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
