Don't worry — you can stay healthy by incorporating at least 15 minutes of fast walking into your everyday routine, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it's recommended that people commit to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week to see sufficient health benefits, said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study's corresponding author. But if 150 minutes is too difficult to manage, fast walking a minimum of 15 minutes every day can have the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng and a team of researchers recruited mostly low-income and Black study participants from 2002 to 2009, according to the study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The nearly 85,000 participants were given a comprehensive questionnaire about their exercise habits, average time spent working out, walking speed and health. Then the participants completed a questionnaire about 16 years later, and the analysis began in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know "fast &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51188871" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is good compared to slow walking," but there isn't much research on how many minutes you should spend fast walking on average, said Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and the Anne Potter Wilson Professor in Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, study participants who fast walked for at least 15 minutes every day saw a nearly 20% reduction in premature death compared with a 4% reduction among participants who walked slowly for a total of more than three hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. And it certainly makes sense, because you can imagine, somebody who's in really bad shape is probably not going to be able to walk very quickly," said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking can impact your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has health benefits, such as managing weight and sugar intake, reducing the risk of cancer, easing joint pain and boosting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts "know that when people are exercising regularly, blood vessels can relax and dilate a bit better. And then we also know that exercise is quite good for cholesterol, so it seems to lower cholesterol. And then overall, it reduces the risk of cancer and things that would otherwise hurt people," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily can also lower the risk of dementia or cognitive decline in people predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in daily physical activity, such as walking, promotes better sleep and reduces inflammation, which improves brain structure, according to the Piedmont Medical Center in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to emphasize that these exercises, no matter slow or fast, all confirm some benefit," Zheng said. "But what we find is that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day confirms substantiated benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking has been found to have specific benefits, such as decreasing the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(T)he thought is that exercise has a very big effect on blood pressure, as you may know, and blood pressure, it is one of the more exponential risk factors that we have, for roughly every 20 points blood pressure goes above 120 (what is considered normal or healthy), the risk of a cardiac event roughly doubles," Freeman said. "So, it's a super potent and exponential risk factor, and we know that regular exercise lowers that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, you can tell you're fast walking when you're able to talk but not sing, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can increase your walking pace by a couple of steps and track it with a metronome, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/health/walking-cadence-mobility-speed-endurance-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;July study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I usually recommend that they get up before work, and they go for a brisk walk or a bike or a swim, or they do some high-intensity interval training, whatever it is that they're into," Freeman said. People can go to "a rec center, or they walk outside, if it is safe, or whatever it may be, and just weave it into their day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following good &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/perfecting-your-walking-technique#:~:text=Eyes%20up.,reduce%20your%20risk%20of%20injury." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;walking form&lt;/a&gt;, such as standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms, can help prevent backaches, make it easy to breathe and keep you balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking is a full-body movement. It is not just about your lower body. It's not just one step in front of the one foot in front of the other," said Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, in a previous article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your arm swing is a huge part involved in the mechanics of walking. So, you want to have an arm swing that's coordinated with your foot movement, so it's opposing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take it up a notch? When doing any form of exercise, try to practice conscious or nasal breathing, which is when you inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps regulate blood pressure and can prevent hypertension, according to Santas&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The pill was actually made up entirely of a synthetic opioid called nitazene that can be 40 times deadlier &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911513/reason-fentanyl-deaths-decreasing-washington-state.html"&gt;than fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;. Lucci overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, McCallister has heard from other parents in her native Houston, Texas, who say their children’s deaths were also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14582955/drug-nitazene-heroin-UK-US-fentanyl-epidemic.html"&gt;linked to nitazenes&lt;/a&gt;, a class of drugs that health officials worry could drive the next phase in the overdose epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the past two weeks, I would say even the last week, with the interest in Lucci's story, other parents are reaching out to me because they've lost their children,’ she told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Houston has been hit particularly hard by the arrival of nitazene, which first began infiltrating the US drug supply in 2019. From May 2024 to 2025 alone, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-5a3afa80-788a-11f0-8e94-9fe044075bc6"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; DEA agents reported 15 nitazene overdose deaths in people aged 17 to 59, the highest death count since the first drug seizure in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucci’s friend Hunter Clement, 21, was one of them. He took two pills sold to him in April, one a counterfeit Xanax and the other a counterfeit Percocet. He also overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most standard post-mortem drug screens do not test for nitazenes, and the local authorities in Houston did not have the type of comprehensive panel that would detect nitazenes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the two moms took the pills they found near their sons’ bodies to a specialized lab for testing. When the results came back as nitazenes, the women said they’d never heard of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci Reyes-McCallister, pictured with his mother Grey, unknowingly took a pill made up of a synthetic opioid rarely found in the drug supply before 2019. He died at age 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'll never forget when the detective called,’ McCallister, who has a background in pharmaceuticals, said. ‘I had him repeat the name twice. I had him spell it two or three times. I was looking for an active ingredient in there, something I recognized the name of, and I didn't.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they learned was that the pill that killed Lucci was pure nitazene. There was no fentanyl and zero trace of Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In hindsight, McCallister suspects this was not Lucci's first encounter with nitazene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Lucci took a pill and suffered a non-fatal overdose that required five doses of Narcan, the antidote for opioid overdoses, to bring him back to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister thinks nitazene had been pressed into that pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He bounced back because he was terrified, and he was doing better,’ McCallister said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the thing with people of that age is you want to have a social life, you hang out with people, and that usually involves alcohol, and I think that's when the inhibitions slip.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister is currently working with law enforcement to find out where her son had been buying the counterfeit pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucci is pictured at his high school graduation. He aspired to be a tattoo artist and had been working in a prestigious apprenticeship when he died&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci and his mother were very close. McCallister talked to him 'a gazillion times a day,' she told the Daily Mail, exchanging texts, calls, memes, and silly videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Lucci’s family checked in with him ‘a gazillion times a day,’ his mom said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family exchanged calls, texts, memes, and funny videos. But on the day he overdosed, they began to worry when they hadn’t heard from him for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was found dead in his apartment on January 26 with two pills nearby pressed to look like Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He had a fulfilling life. He had a family that loved him. He was doing great,’ his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Clement, mourning her son’s death a few months later, learned of Lucci’s passing, she immediately connected the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to McCallister and, from there, had two pills left near Hunter’s body tested more comprehensively for the toxins that a standard screen could not detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clement found Hunter one April evening after a long day at work. Hunter had come home the night before, apparently drunk, sparking worry in his parents. Perhaps he had taken half a pill, she thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Lucci, Hunter had been doing well. He had been introduced to the pills by a friend the previous year, likely not knowing they could contain fentanyl or nitazenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had a few rough months, but he never overdosed or needed Narcan. And his personality hadn’t changed much. From December through his death in April, he was the same son they knew and loved, his mom told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter took what were sold to him as Xanax and Percocet and fatally overdosed in April at 21. Further testing found the pills were made up entirely of the same nitazene that killed Lucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter is shown third from left surrounded by his family. According to his mother, he was his niece's favorite uncle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that night in April, his parents feared Hunter had made a sharp turn down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The next day, when I went to work, he was sleeping. My husband went and checked on him around noon. He was sitting up in his bed,’ Clement told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then, when I got home, I found him in his bed, and he must have taken one of each [counterfeit oxycodone and counterfeit Xanax].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first version, or analog, of nitazenes was developed in the 1950s as a potent opioid painkiller, but was never used in medicine due to its dangerously high overdose risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But still deadlier analogs of the original, like N-pyrrolidino protonitazene, which killed Lucci and Hunter, have resurfaced since 2019, infiltrating the illicit drug supplies of Europe, the UK, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Renna, Assistant Port Director for Cargo Operations at JFK Airport in New York City told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/buyer-beware-bad-actors-exploit-de-minimis-shipments"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt; in May: ‘Earlier this month, we seized almost a pound of nitazene that was going to a private residence in South Carolina. It was shipped from the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Unfortunately, here at JFK, we’re seeing xylazine and nitazenes at least a few times a week in quantities ranging from just a few grams to upwards of a pound or more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter's mother said he had a great sense of humor and took his role as an uncle very seriously. He had been doing well in the months leading up to his sudden overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is still steeped in a years-long opioid overdose crisis that is believed to have killed more than 800,000 people since it began in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, the US overdose death rate decreased by four from 2022 to 2023, dropping from 32.6 to 31.3 fatalities per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline is promising, but the increasing danger of another deadly synthetic opiate has overshadowed public health officials' optimism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the threat of a new wave of the opioid epidemic taking form, parents like McCallister and Clement have channeled their grief into an awareness campaign by sharing their sons’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sadly, it just takes one pill, or one line of something, or, heaven forbid, in the future, a hit off of a vape,’ McCallister said. ‘I mean, this is very dangerous territory we're wading into.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:56:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxQVnp1Y2RDNVF1dkRsLTFaZ0s1MmUyNG9mcFhlbXppSzA1eUhzeUEzZDc2anF2SEt5Zll4ZW9VVUtOVkoxcmZidnhCaFFoZXNJSVFXQzA2YVhEVEtCeGM5dFR3UjN2a1Q4M1VGVVhsYVBHRDBVQkpRdW0yY2x3NzM5U0I1Q0FlNk4yOTZCYVB1ME9yRjBDRDVrZkxYVkRDZ2ZfMW4wRmZaSHFrMlRySDQ2UmMxdzZzYW1kRlZha2doQUJFX0J5Y255U0g0dTPSAdIBQVVfeXFMTV9ySjYwc0lBVE5jNlEyRTFSeG9iVFZXR3owLWJtYklqZXBJZ2JBeTFQbE9CR2VSelZWNjU5cW1lVU01NmJwcnI1ZkppcmpVYjV6T05OczJfMjRWNkdUOVBIVndhZXlYYjlBN3VHVGpXUVo3QllPb0lVUHd6NWVET1FVT2pJLUJ2TEdMUnZ3dUt0MW1hUXVydjlncUN0NkJvZkFubDZOOUNPWGtxZWVYbFRKMDZCUnlaQjFDa2tSMUZXUEtUSDh4SGI1bkpudnFMcTd3</guid></item><item><title>哈佛肠道专家的10种最佳早餐组合-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNd2tsM0wyQjc3d0U0dlBNTktYX2ktTk9uc1Bkal90eE1jXzJ3dHBOTktQd2l3WlFpUU90Z2RWWmppUkxLOGw3eE9pWEZpT3dtUF8teG1JdnV1dWZjRHRTcTkxY2VRcjN0bVlrUF9YdFU1R1dkT0RzZlRESjZGYkFUc3V2X1RaNUxxaS1yVFFSaWplRm5FRnZ5VFR4NWg2bW1KSUdCdmF3VlMtMHdpOEpGRGNtcDRBRzBsY1NrTkl3SXJPZ194TVF0Q1RoTzBNbEFZc3M0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering what to have for breakfast that is equally healthy and tasty.?

For the first time in years, I feel mentally ready to connect with others, and I’m seeking a casual friends-with-benefits situation—something low-pressure but meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh76001c3b79hrnxv6nk@published"&gt;Here’s the issue: receiving oral sex is physically difficult for me. I’m well-endowed, and new partners often get excited to go down on me—but I tend to go soft during the act, no matter what I’ve tried (even Viagra). It’s not about shame or lack of attraction. It’s a trauma response. But of course, I can’t unpack all that with a hookup I just met, and many men take my reaction personally.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhb0001d3b79zahtfh88@published"&gt;It’s a similar story with giving oral. I’m a bottom and want to please my partners, but the act can trigger me. I want to be upfront, but not in a way that overshares or kills the mood. How can I communicate this early on in a way that’s honest but doesn’t derail the whole experience?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhld001g3b79tg296rft@published"&gt;It is reasonable, de rigueur even, to spell out what you are (and, in some cases, aren’t) into before a hookup. If you’re meeting guys via apps, this can be as simple as including info in your profile (“No oral, only anal,” for example), or letting them know during your coordinating chat. If you’re meeting guys in person, a brief conversation explaining your boundaries should also suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhpf001h3b79tmsc0tft@published"&gt;However, know that this may derail the experience for some potential partners. I think your main task is getting to be OK with that. If people can’t abide by your boundaries, they aren’t worth your time. People may filter themselves out if they’re looking for oral, and a lot of them will be. Guys, even the top-identified, may be drooling for your big dick, but bottoms who don’t want their dicks played with are fairly common. That’s not going to shatter a seasoned top’s understanding of the universe. I think you’ll find that what is more of a dealbreaker is you not wanting to suck, but I think you’ll still do fine even with that boundary stated up front. Anecdotally, I see tops in hook-up profiles advertising that they just want anal. They are out there. As with any interest/disinterest that deviates from the status quo, this is just about finding your people, and that process involves rejecting others as you shuffle through. Just be patient and know that if anyone turns you down as a result of your interests, it’s not personal. After all, they won’t yet know you well enough for it to be personal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhvo001j3b79k2qxq7uv@published"&gt;I am a gay man in my mid 30s in a committed, monogamous relationship with an amazing man. Prior to dating him, I lived a very sexually active life and was very involved in the hookup culture. While I don’t judge others for the choices they make when it comes to their sex life, I’ve come to realize my promiscuity was born from a desire to be accepted and from a desire for intimacy. It has taken a lot of work to work through the shame and the guilt I have felt from abusing my body and giving it away so liberally, but I’m slowly accepting my past as a part of my journey of growth and looking at my past self through kinder eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhyx001k3b79lozavva8@published"&gt;With all that said, my partner and I have a very active sex life. Sex with him is by far the best I’ve ever experienced and it seems like each time he’s coming up with new ways to please me. On the other hand, while I have had quite a few hook ups in the past, they really haven’t required me to get very creative or to put in a lot of work. My partner only tops so I am the bottom in our relationship. Aside from riding, what other positions would work well for a bottom looking to please their partner? Also, while I love giving him oral, his penis does curve which triggers my gag reflex. I love this man so any suggestions on how to please him in the same way he pleases me would be most appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="214" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxiap001n3b795s38itf7@published"&gt;Congrats on overcoming your velvet rage. You say that tops in the past haven’t &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; you to get creative. Is there anything different about this current relationship that would cause you to feel required to do so? If not, you’re probably fine—some tops just want to be able to do what they will with a hole, little-to-no work required on the bottom’s part other than being receptive. There’s a reason why topping has been traditionally considered the “active” role: It tends to require more physical work. Things don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be this way, but what it could mean for you is riding low expectations all the way to mutual orgasms for you and your partner. I get the sense that you want to surprise your partner with new tricks, but in terms of the vibe and actual sensation, these may not be his thing. You would do better to have a conversation ahead of time about whether or not there’s anything he’d like you to do. The fact of the matter is that any and all positions could work well for a bottom looking to please their partner … depending on the top’s taste and the bottom’s willingness. You wrote a rave review of your sex life so this might be a don’t-fix-what-isn’t-broken situation.&lt;/p&gt;

See if he’s into it. And for oral, try coming at him another way. If you tend to approach from below (as in, him standing while you are kneeling or even if he’s lying down and you situate yourself between his legs), instead approach from above. Have him lay on his back and approach from the top (as if in a 69 position). That can help with accommodating, depending on his curve. You could also try laying on the bed with your head over the edge and have him thrust into you. Again, it will depend on his curve but that could help you take him (tell him to go easy, especially at first because an overeager top thrusting deep can also make things more difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

Lately, though, she’s been having flare ups of chronic pain after receiving (the orgasms are so intense they activate it).

I’m usually a hot and ready girl, but I’m just not in the mood given everything, and the pattern of me not being able to get turned on has really hurt my partner’s feelings and led to her feeling blamed and rejected. I just want to get back to feeling horny and having excellent sex! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

You have generously accommodated your partner’s limitations, but it seems that it’s at your expense. More tinkering may be in order. The troubleshooting that needs to be done is figuring out how you can mitigate your partner’s pain while facilitating your pleasure. This will require working together closely, and that I think might be the biggest hurdle here.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvts00223b79xyn2o4sr@published"&gt;It’s going to be hard to collaborate in such an intimate space when there are negative feelings pervading it. It’s likely that your issues here go way beyond positioning—the shame that has entered your bedroom could be just as big of an impediment, if not more so. Your partner’s reactions have not been ideal. It seems that she is honest in her expression, but she hasn’t been extending the kind of sensitivity that you need. She doesn’t have to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; your squirting but she should accept it as part of your body’s functionality. Not doing so risks you feeling rejected. It seems that she has also taken personally your body’s reaction to the changes you’ve integrated. That’s a choice she doesn’t have to make. It may be disappointing, even upsetting, that your solutions for managing her pain didn’t fall perfectly into place for both of you, but this is a practical matter. At the very least, there’s an alternate interpretation for your response that doesn’t involve your body unconsciously snubbing her. Why is she opting for that one?&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvtt00233b791sus6uge@published"&gt;I don’t know what your dynamic is like, and I don’t know how your own behavior and reactions have contributed to it, but what I read was a letter from someone who has done a lot for their partner and it’s still not good enough. Whether you are being treated unfairly or are extremely sensitive to your partner’s feedback (or a little bit of both) is for you to determine. Clarity there will help further conversations on this matter. There may be ways to reconfigure your sex so that you are both satisfied. It won’t necessarily be at the same time—maybe one session is tailored to your pleasure, the next to her’s. Obviously, you may be limited by what her body has the capacity to endure, but she may also need to compromise a bit. Maybe there’s a position that is good for your pleasure/orgasms that isn’t strictly comfortable for her, but also isn’t so uncomfortable as to be unpleasant. If she won’t approach either your conversations about emotions or strategizing for sex with a sense of compromise and collaboration, that’s data. It indicates there’s more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

I was very flattered but I declined because my husband and I have never talked about that and I felt he’d consider it cheating, which is fair. But, I’ll be honest, I was kind of interested. I’d be open to it with her; only if my husband agreed.

&lt;p&gt;On August 20, 2025, Russia will launch the Bion-M No. 2 biosatellite atop a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, marking a key step in studying the effects of spaceflight on living organisms. As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/russia-to-launch-75-mice-1-000-fruit-flies-on-aug-20-to-study-spaceflight-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the spacecraft will carry&lt;strong&gt; 75 mice&lt;/strong&gt;, over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt;, and other biological specimens for a 30-day mission in space, exposing them to high levels of radiation. The goal is to gain insights into the biological effects of space travel, crucial for advancing deep-space missions and understanding long-term impacts on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Noah’s Ark” for its diverse payload, the mission also carries lunar simulants—dust and rocks mimicking materials found on the moon’s surface. These simulants will be studied after returning to Earth to assess how they react to space radiation and the vacuum of space, aiding plans for future lunar construction. The mission aims to gather critical data on microgravity and radiation’s effects on organisms, with potential applications in astronaut health and space medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examining the Impact of Space Radiation on Mice and Other Organisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key experiments onboard the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 &lt;/strong&gt;mission involves studying the effects of space radiation on mice. These animals were chosen for the experiment due to their genetic similarity to humans, their short life cycles, and their heightened sensitivity to radiation. This experiment could have wide-reaching implications for human space travel. The mice will be divided into three distinct groups: the first group will live in normal conditions on Earth, the second group will be housed in a simulated flight environment on Earth as a control, and the third group will spend 30 days in orbit. The results will allow researchers to compare the health and biological responses of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice will be monitored closely throughout the mission. Each mouse-carrying unit is equipped with essential systems, including feeding, lighting, ventilation, and waste disposal mechanisms. Specialized &lt;strong&gt;cameras and sensors &lt;/strong&gt;will provide real-time data on the mice’s condition, and some rodents will be implanted with chips to track physiological changes. Upon return to Earth, the researchers will analyze how the mice adapted to space conditions and how they readapted after returning to Earth’s gravity. This data will help scientists understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on living organisms and the potential risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunar Simulants to Test Space Effects on Moon Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another significant component of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2&lt;/strong&gt; mission involves the study of lunar simulants. These are materials designed to mimic the dust and rocks found on the moon’s surface, specifically those from the high latitudes. The purpose of this experiment is to assess how space radiation and the vacuum environment affect these materials. The results of this experiment will have broad implications for future moon construction projects, where the ability to use local materials to build structures will be critical for long-term lunar habitation. The lunar simulants will be carefully analyzed after their return to Earth to see how they were altered by their exposure to space conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the &lt;strong&gt;Vernadsky Institute &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;IMBP &lt;/strong&gt;in preparing the lunar simulants underscores the importance of this mission in advancing the scientific understanding of space construction materials. The testing of these materials in space will also help scientists determine how radiation and microgravity might affect future building materials used in extraterrestrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Spaceflight Impacts the Biological Health of Organisms in Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bion-M No. 2 mission &lt;/strong&gt;will collect invaluable data on the biological effects of spaceflight, specifically focusing on how organisms respond to microgravity and radiation. Researchers hope to gain insights into how these factors contribute to the deterioration of biological systems in space. The experiment will provide essential information on how microgravity influences the radiation susceptibility of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/nasa-discovers-massive-planet-bigger-than-earth-with-gas-tied-exclusively-to-living-organisms/" data-type="post" data-id="74921"&gt;living organisms&lt;/a&gt;, which could significantly impact the design of future deep-space missions. The data gathered could also be used to improve astronaut health management strategies, making long-term space travel safer and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the mice, more than &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt; are also part of the mission. Fruit flies are commonly used in biological experiments due to their relatively short life cycles and well-understood genetic makeup. Their inclusion in this mission provides another level of insight into how space conditions affect organisms at various levels of complexity. With multiple types of organisms being studied, the Bion-M No. 2 mission is expected to yield diverse and comprehensive data on the impact of spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Radiation in Long-Duration Space Missions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial elements of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 mission&lt;/strong&gt; is its focus on radiation. Space radiation is a major concern for long-duration space travel, as it can cause significant harm to living tissues and increase the risk of cancer. The Bion-M No. 2 spacecraft will be placed in a nearly circular orbit with an inclination of around 97 degrees, which will increase the level of cosmic radiation that the organisms are exposed to. This orbital position is specifically chosen to increase radiation exposure by at least an order of magnitude compared to previous missions like Bion-M No. 1. By studying the effects of this radiation on the mice and other specimens, the mission aims to better understand how space radiation influences biological systems and how to mitigate these risks for future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data gathered from this experiment will be critical for developing new technologies and strategies to protect astronauts from the harmful effects of radiation. Space agencies worldwide are keenly aware of the risks posed by space radiation, and the findings from this mission could pave the way for new innovations in space health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqb3ct0012o3m6haruencg@published"&gt;Two years ago, I had a conversation with my doctor that remains one of the more unnerving interactions I have ever had. After reviewing the results of a routine blood test, she wanted to know if I had recently experienced any of the following: loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, or a seizure. No, no, no, and no. Then she wanted to know: Did I have an altered mental state? At that point, debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiog001z3b796m59o14w@published"&gt;It turned out I had too little sodium in my blood. As the doctor and I talked, the culprit became clear: My healthy lifestyle was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00203b79x2trp7xs@published"&gt;I run or go to the gym every day. I try to eat well. I drink plenty of water, especially when I’m working out.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00213b79fr9jjx5g@published"&gt;Bombarded by public health warnings about the dangers of not drinking enough, I was terrified of dehydration. Add in &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/04/decoder-ring-the-history-of-hydration"&gt;cultural myths&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/#:~:text=Rather%2C%20surveys%20of%20food%20and,and%20certainly%20not%20overtly%20ill."&gt;the 8x8 rule&lt;/a&gt;—eight glasses of 8 ounces of water a day—and lifestyle messaging that drinking more water will help me have better skin, hair, sleep, digestion, you name it, and I was knocking back at least 3 liters of water each day&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That was on top of my morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!), and any other drinks I happened to have. Yes, those things count toward water intake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00223b79wzvc9abe@published"&gt;Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00233b793vr0ujdn@published"&gt;And now I was in danger. In the body along with water is sodium—an essential electrolyte that helps your body maintain its fluid balance, preserves nerve and muscle function, and keeps your heart working, among other things. A healthy sodium level is anywhere between 135 and 145 millimoles per liter of blood. Sodium is naturally found in food, and people who eat a Western diet tend to add quite a bit extra to their meals in the form of table salt too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00243b79boc8hg1q@published"&gt;But the body’s delicate balance between water and salt can be rapidly thrown out of whack, especially during exercise. At one end of the spectrum is dehydration. At the other is overhydration and hyponatremia, a potentially life-threatening condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00253b79j0ri6zan@published"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when a person’s blood sodium levels drop below 135 millimoles per liter of blood. If someone drinks to excess, they effectively dilute their blood sodium levels. At the same time, water starts to leak into their body’s tissues, causing them to swell, explains &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamara-Hew-Butler"&gt;Tamara Hew-Butler&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based podiatrist who specializes in treating and studying runners. In severe cases, the brain can start to swell, leading to some of hyponatremia’s core symptoms: confusion, dizziness, the inability to speak properly, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00263b7923l55u4x@published"&gt;I was training for a half-marathon at the time that I was diagnosed with hyponatremia, and I was easily drinking 4 liters of water or sports drinks a day. My doctor was blunt: I was drinking too much and not replacing the salt I had lost in sweat. And while I didn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as if anything was wrong with me, if I didn’t change, I would be putting myself at risk of far worse than a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00273b79d00u54cu@published"&gt;“When the sodium level starts to creep downward, people are more likely to experience more severe symptoms,” said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/climateandhealth/about-us"&gt;Paul Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency medicine physician and an affiliate faculty member at the University of Colorado. A person can lose consciousness, have seizures, collapse, vomit, and fall into a coma. In extreme cases, the brain swells so much that the brain stem herniates—a rupture that is fatal. All of this can happen in the space of just a few hours. Multiple marathon runners and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/07/health/young-athletes-football-overhydration-partner"&gt;other athletes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450341/Marathon-victim-died-drinking-MUCH-water.html"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-14-na-briefs14.1-story.html"&gt;died of overhydration&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00283b79qhgc2pza@published"&gt;While some people can be at risk of low sodium because they take certain medications or have an underlying health problem, exercise-associated hyponatremia strikes otherwise healthy people. A lot of what we know about the condition comes from studying ultrarunners and other endurance athletes, as well as the military. There’s some evidence to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9699060/"&gt;suggest that women&lt;/a&gt; may be more at risk than men, and while it’s unclear why, hyponatremia tends to be more severe in smaller individuals purely because it’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20199991/"&gt;easier for them to overconsume&lt;/a&gt; fluids relative to their body mass, said &lt;a href="https://hhpr.uark.edu/directory/uid/brendonm/name/Brendon+P.+McDermott/"&gt;Brendon McDermott&lt;/a&gt;, a physiologist at the University of Arkansas and a seasoned marathoner.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00293b79j3hzs7ob@published"&gt;It is also unclear how many people may experience hyponatremia, in part because not everyone shows symptoms, Charlton said. Interestingly, some studies suggest that certain people may just be low in sodium all the time, while others suggest that some people might not be able to access their body’s sodium stores efficiently, tending them &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16344476/"&gt;toward hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi002a3b798cglf65m@published"&gt;What is abundantly clear, however, is that when people stop drinking to thirst and instead compel themselves to take in fluids while exercising, their physiology can rapidly spiral out of control. (Theoretically, you could also overhydrate while sitting in your car and throwing back Stanley cups full of water, but it would be exceedingly difficult.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002b3b79pjtxkfqa@published"&gt;During exercise, the descent into hyponatremia can be exacerbated in particular ways, Hew-Butler said, not least by sweating out salts. But there is a hormonal aspect too: Vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone, ramps up during exercise, and especially when it’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002c3b79w6yivswb@published"&gt;“Your body’s like, ‘Oh my God, I’m losing water. I’m not going to pee it out,’ ” Hew-Butler said. By suppressing the call of nature while you’re losing fluid through sweat, the body is trying to maintain that delicate water-to-salt ratio and keep everything working the way it should, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002d3b79vtmuvade@published"&gt;In other words, the body starts trying to retain fluid. Importantly, subbing out water for sports drinks is not going to cut it: “It functionally makes very little difference in terms of people’s outcome,” Charlton said. He and other experts I spoke to all agreed that most sports drinks should be treated as water. (For context, most commercial sports drinks contain around 10 percent of a person’s recommended daily sodium—a 20-ounce bottle of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, for example, has 270 milligrams, or about 11 percent, while a 12-ounce bottle of Powerade contains 240 milligrams of sodium, which is 10 percent.) So if you start chugging sports drinks or water midway through a run, then you can quickly swell your cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002e3b79jl7e68zd@published"&gt;“That’s why sometimes people get in more trouble during exercise,” Hew-Butler said. “They preload and they keep loading.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002f3b796so943mx@published"&gt;Confoundingly, hyponatremia’s early clinical presentation—dizziness, headache, confusion—appears almost exactly the same as that of dehydration or heat exhaustion. Hyponatremia can be confirmed only by a blood test, and while medical tents at large sports events and emergency rooms have the kit to be able to quickly ascertain people’s sodium levels, your average Jane—me!—might not realize the true nature of their problem. And that can make things worse, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002g3b797cemfdqz@published"&gt;In an increasing number of cases, Charlton said, people who don’t fit the typical mold for acute or exercise-associated hyponatremia are being diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002h3b79ix827job@published"&gt;If someone is out hiking or playing in a high school football game, or even just doing some gardening in hot weather, they might be tempted to drink a lot of water even if they aren’t thirsty in a bid to avoid dehydration or merely to cool down, he said, unwittingly endangering themself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002i3b79kwdqs2jn@published"&gt;Charlton recalled the case of a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39085067/"&gt;Japanese woman&lt;/a&gt; who was performing on an outdoor stage on a hot day. She collapsed and had a five-minute seizure after her act. It turned out that, worried about heat injury and following public health guidance to drink lots of water, she had drunk about 4 liters of liquid during her show. When staffers took her blood at the hospital, they learned that her sodium level was 117.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002j3b79akb2elia@published"&gt;“It was not clear at the beginning [that she had hyponatremia] because she did not fit their profile,” Charlton said. “She wasn’t an ultrarunner. She wasn’t engaged in regular high-stress activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002k3b79jvjtj9l7@published"&gt;She was simply trying to take care of herself. And doing that before you are thirsty can lead to trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002l3b79ztm4ocir@published"&gt;“You hear a lot about, like, thirst is inadequate, and if you get thirsty, it’s too late,” Hew-Butler said. “But thirst is a biological mechanism that’s been conserved for 700 million years,” she added. “It’s not defective when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002m3b79xofy7ex4@published"&gt;This resonated with me. I had always thought that if I felt thirsty during exercise, and especially in hot weather, then I was in trouble—dehydrated and at risk of heat exhaustion. I never once considered that I might not feel thirsty because I had drunk &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002n3b79f9up9tbn@published"&gt;It’s true that dehydration and heat exhaustion are more common than hyponatremia—a survey of active military personnel in 2024 found just &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591377/"&gt;134 cases of exertional hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;, while there were &lt;a href="https://www.health.mil/News/Articles/2025/06/01/MSMR-Heat-Illness-2025?type=Reports"&gt;471 cases of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; and 2,380 cases of heat exhaustion, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002o3b79t2oukfph@published"&gt;But McDermott, the University of Arkansas physiologist, noted that while dehydration alone is unlikely to kill you, if you develop hyponatremia and it goes unchecked, then it could rapidly be deadly in and of itself. “There should be education on hyponatremia, equal to dehydration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002p3b7985wdgtq2@published"&gt;He and other experts I spoke to for this story said that people taking part in sporting events should be issued guidance on overhydration, and that public health messaging must be clearer about the specific dangers of hyponatremia. Hew-Butler suggested that events like marathons should actually limit their water and sports drink stations to discourage overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002q3b79syvudr7o@published"&gt;Charlton argues that public health officials must be cognizant of hyponatremia when they make recommendations for dealing with hotter weather (something we’ll only have more and more of due to climate change). “Probably, as more people are experiencing heat with climate change, there is just going to be a different profile of person that we have to look at these issues in,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002r3b79btgqrgr5@published"&gt;If someone is suspected of having hyponatremia—a condition that is, again, tricky to diagnose—the first, best thing they can do is stop drinking water, Hew-Butler said. In my case, my doctor told me to drink no more than a liter of fluid—water, coffee, soda, whatever—for several days in order to bring my sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. As a person accustomed to drinking 3 or 4 liters a day, I found that cutting back was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002s3b79xnc75iap@published"&gt;More acute cases require more intervention: In some instances, doctors might inject a little very salty saline into a person’s blood to try to bring up their sodium levels. If the patient is able to swallow, they might make them drink a quarter cup of water containing four dissolved bouillon cubes—which honestly sounds not bad. What about salt supplements? There is mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/02/electrolyte-supplements-dont-prevent-illness-in-athletes.html"&gt;sodium supplements&lt;/a&gt; like salt tablets aren’t enough to prevent hyponatremia during intense exercise, although McDermott said they likely wouldn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002t3b79mpjevhhd@published"&gt;At the same time, there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/"&gt;no single recommended amount of water&lt;/a&gt; that everyone should drink while working out, Hew-Butler said. In fact, you can calculate how much fluid you lose while exercising by weighing yourself before and after an hour of your chosen activity. The difference indicates the water weight shed through sweat. Apart from that, she and the other experts I spoke to for this piece all had the same recommendations: Drink when you’re thirsty. Stop when you’re not. Eat salt. And if you find yourself craving salt on a long run, buy a bag of pretzels or chips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002u3b798oiky8ko@published"&gt;Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgion002v3b79edeiuzbw@published"&gt;And as Hew-Butler told me, hydration is “an experiment of one.” Another way to put it: We live in a world full of giant water bottles. We fetishize an easy health fix. But, particularly if you’re an athlete, listen to your own thirst cues and just say no to big &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;hydration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States alone, an estimated 178 million people are missing at least one tooth, which explains why dentures and titanium implants replacements are so common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentistry is now aiming for something better, a living replacement that feels and functions like the original. The idea is not science fiction anymore, and it is moving from animal studies toward carefully designed human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/pamela-yelick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pamela C. Yelick&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt; School of Dental Medicine leads one of the teams moving this vision toward the clinic. A recent study from her and colleague &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/weibo-zhang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weibo Zhang&lt;/a&gt; have pushed the conversation onto the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dentures-as-tooth-replacements"&gt;Dentures as tooth replacements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth loss is not rare, and the burden rises with age worldwide. About 7 percent of people 20 or older have complete tooth loss, and that figure reaches 23 percent for those 60 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern implants are anchored directly to the jaw through osseointegration, a concept that traces back to Per Ingvar Brånemark’s mid twentieth century work with titanium and bone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history matters because it explains why implants are stable, and also why they do not feel like natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural teeth are suspended in the socket by the periodontal ligament, which provides sensation and micro movement control that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-successfully-grow-human-teeth-in-a-laboratory-for-the-first-time/"&gt;implants&lt;/a&gt; lack. That difference shows up as reduced tactile sensitivity with implants compared with natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load also travels differently through an implant than through a tooth root cushioned by ligament fibers. Over time, that can contribute to bone loss around the fixture and biological complications that sometimes lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-routes-to-living-teeth"&gt;Two routes to living teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One route grows a replacement as a tissue, using a scaffold that guides cells to assemble into a tooth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent large animal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729491/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used decellularized tooth bud scaffolds seeded with human dental pulp cells, porcine dental epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then implanted these constructs into adult minipig jaws where they formed tooth like tissues including periodontal ligament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other route tries to spark tooth development in place by presenting the right developmental signals to adult cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120109/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; mapping the choreography of early human tooth formation are building a playbook that identifies the epithelial and mesenchymal cues needed to kick off organized growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-roots-and-ligaments"&gt;Tooth roots and ligaments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scaffold approach matters because the emerging structures were not inert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dental-pulp-stem-cells-from-extracted-wisdom-teeth-can-treat-multiple-diseases/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; supporting ligament and mineralized tissues in the socket and progressed over a period of months, which brings the approach closer to human scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even creating a tooth root that you could put an artificial crown on, with living dental pulp in the middle, secured by periodontal ligaments instead of being screwed into the jaw, could be a huge improvement to a person’s oral health and in turn, systemic health,” said Yelick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-helps-tooth-replacement"&gt;Protein helps tooth replacement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate line of work targets a specific protein, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7880588/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1&lt;/a&gt;, that suppresses tooth formation. Blocking USAG-1 in mice rescued missing teeth caused by different genetic problems, and the same strategy produced new incisors in ferrets, which share a human-like replacement pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, a single administration was enough to generate a whole tooth,” stated &lt;a href="https://toregem.co.jp/en/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katsu Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;, whose group &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research-news/2021-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the antibody treatment while at &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A humanized anti USAG-1 antibody has been advanced by industry collaborators, with investigators reporting that a phase 1 protocol has been finalized and preparations for future studies are underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That marks the shift from animal proof of concept to testing for safety, dosing, and early signals of activity in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing updates from partners indicate plans to run the first in human study and to prepare for subsequent pediatric trials if early results support it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial clinical focus is congenital tooth agenesis in young children, where a therapy that triggers tooth development could change lifelong care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-would-count-as-success"&gt;What would count as success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A living &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tooth-enamel-analysis-suggests-early-eurasians-were-multiple-species-paranthropus-robustus/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; would restore ligament mediated sensation, which helps people modulate bite force and detect grit or high spots. It would also reconnect to bone through tissues that are built to bear chewing loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those features could reduce pain and bone loss around a replacement compared with a rigid post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could also lengthen functional life compared with today’s devices, which often need repair or replacement after years of wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-cost-and-complexity"&gt;What about cost and complexity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell based therapies will only reach clinics if they can be produced reliably and priced within reach of today’s prosthetic options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing compatible epithelial cells at the right developmental stage is a known challenge, and that is why teams built their scaffolds around young pig tooth buds while they refine ways to recruit a patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work with induced pluripotent stem cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9065891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iPSC&lt;/a&gt;s) is also moving forward, including efforts to make enamel forming cells and repair enamel defects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As methods improve, the main questions will be safety, quality control, and whether costs can compete with implant dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-replacement-and-future-tech"&gt;Tooth replacement and future tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An atlas of human fetal tooth development now details epithelial subpopulations and their signaling to mesenchyme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That resource gives researchers the specific factors and timing likely needed to nudge adult cells toward making a new tooth unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those cues can be delivered precisely, either by a staged therapy in the jaw or by organoid-like constructs that finish maturing in the socket, dentists could one day replace a lost tooth with a living one that integrates, remodels, and feels like it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/article/14/2/szae076/7933795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Witnesses have photographed these hairless growths oozing pus covering most of the animals' bodies, from their heads and eyes to their legs, feet, and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some on social media have suspected that the animals are carrying squirrel pox, a rare virus in the US that mainly affects red squirrels, others have pointed out that the illness is more likely to be squirrel fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition is caused by a different virus, resulting in wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own, and is more common in US gray squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In either case, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may be unintentionally causing the virus to spread to more squirrels throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In November 2024, a Reddit user in the US posted an image of a squirrel covered in tumors consistent with squirrel fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis may look terrifying, but it's a common skin disease among gray squirrels in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's caused by the leporipoxvirus and is spread through direct contact between healthy squirrels and the lesions or saliva of infected squirrels, similar to herpes transmission in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes hairless growths or tumors, which can break open and leak clear fluid just like an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the virus cannot spread to humans or other animals such as dogs or birds, Webb said people should not touch or attempt to help infected squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would not recommend trying to capture a squirrel that has the virus,' Webb told the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/05/15/homestead/squirrel-pox-maine-joam40zk0w/"&gt;Bangor Daily News&lt;/a&gt;. 'It is naturally occurring and will run its course in time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To Webb's point, while the growths can look alarming, they typically heal without the need for medication and are rarely fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some severe cases of squirrel fibromatosis may affect the animal's internal organs and lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sightings of infected squirrels date back to the summer of 2023, the most recent cases were posted online less than a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cases are not believed to be squirrel pox, which generally infects red squirrels and is more common in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I thought it was eating something from my front beds, but then I realized it was on its face,' one Reddit user posted on July 31 after spotting a gray squirrel with a large tumor on its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildlife officials noted that sightings tend to rise during the summer when more animals are out gathering food, especially from homes that put out bird feeders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like a lot of people, I love watching birds,' Webb said. 'Unfortunately, you can attract multiple [squirrels] to that feeder and risk exposure if one has the virus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained that squirrels with fibromatosis can leave their saliva on uneaten bird seed at these feeders, which healthy animals can then ingest and contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To this point, wildlife experts have not confirmed whether the new sightings are cases of fibromatosis or squirrel pox (SQPV), but there's less of a chance that squirrel pox is spreading through the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SQPV is a systemic condition that often results in death among red squirrels, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Moreover, SQPV is more common in the UK, as there are more red squirrels in that country compared to the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fibromatosis tumors typically heal on their own within 2 months and do not return among gray squirrels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A similar condition affecting rabbits in the Midwest has prompted many on social media to ask if it would be humane to euthanize animals spotted with these tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like the rabbits infected with cottontail papilloma virus, causing tentacle-like tumors on their heads, wildlife officials have said that people should leave squirrels with fibromatosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A squirrel's immune system can clear the virus within four to eight weeks, although it may take longer for larger or secondary infections to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition does not typically come back once a squirrel contracts fibromatosis, and gray squirrels generally recover fully, meaning the horrifying growths won't be visible by the time people see that same animal next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOclNQbXI1ZHBObUxkc1NVTFBtSkZQSjJMMHQ2OVJLY2RBQ2hfRE00NDBQblFUMGJmbmw5WFR1azlLRXlINnppQmpxQkdpT3ZwWDhKM1Azc2cyX1hiTEc3Z21xYXdYbzhLYlNET2RoaG5PXzMzTk5BZ3poRnVNeUQ0R2NTODVxSTBERkZ1cktONzV5ZzNoX29UN3BKN25Mek5vejNfZ2NB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE5QZ0ZHTW5GWVpsVVF2QkNrWllnd0wxdi02dmVRcW5uMXFXWTBFTmdwMnhfdlZVc3pKNzgwTzluQ3A4c0N2eERmaVVUcjFaZTJlRV9uWnpJalhheTlEMTQxTENra3BfMFFqSlM0R0NOZzI1Y012RlhtcDQxYnBzUVNPY0ptNzB2MDZ1dWRlS0RqRFVTOHQ4UFN0NXlTY1hkZEt3ZTBfTDhqbzBoMA</guid></item><item><title>拉斯维加斯日益严重的蚊子问题是“定时炸弹” - NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQY1ltWVQzYWU1MFREb3I3ZTRqZ3BzdVlFWS1Qb0hhU0lpZW9oQm5xRUZGcjgzQ1JNVTZSRzlmRXZDV0hfZWtmM2NZNlJ0akU1TlJmNlNHcnREdXk3WEczZ0dFQjNyc3gzMjBDRkZhUWYxNkRzV0YwM2l5N2QtQW5GZ05ZTHV0ck1FTmp6UE5oOFBzeVdqNlg40gFWQVVfeXFMTlVCN0FOVlBVcV9kNnFkdHh6UGVoMC1tOU1ZLU5RZ3RYdGp1ZElETU1WeW5haFRkaDR4cmdhNUxIWnJRRGprTFo1RjhjNjJSV2pYVVpra1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5ad3b" class="body-graf"&gt;LAS VEGAS — If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn’t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fac0c8" class="body-graf"&gt;Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/las-vegas-mosquitoes-carrying-west-nile-virus-record-rcna157818" target="_blank"&gt;exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley&lt;/a&gt; in recent years because of a host of changes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f96d3" class="body-graf"&gt;A mix of urban development, climate change,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3bb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what’s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e45a8e" class="body-graf"&gt;The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cdc-warns-increased-dengue-fever-risk-us-rcna158851" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquito-viruses-are-spreading-know-west-nile-eee-rcna168653" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7e8be" class="body-graf"&gt;It's also caught people off guard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f244" class="body-graf"&gt;“People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31b6ef" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'A ticking time bomb'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60c42" class="body-graf"&gt;The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquitoes-carry-west-nile-are-becoming-resistant-insecticides-cdc-say-rcna96867" target="_blank"&gt;becoming resistant to insecticides&lt;/a&gt;, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ad6d4" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8afc4" class="body-graf"&gt;She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57f600" class="body-graf"&gt;“In Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,” Messenger said. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bc9b6" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, &lt;a href="https://media.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/download/mosquito-control/weekly-updates/2025/20250811-arbo-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Southern Nevada Health District&lt;/a&gt;, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/las-vegas-mosquitoes-carrying-west-nile-virus-record-rcna157818" target="_blank"&gt;record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4f998" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, the public health department hasn’t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it’s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a334a" class="body-graf"&gt;“We see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,” she said. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7263f4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District has been &lt;a href="https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/programs/mosquito-surveillance/" target="_blank"&gt;conducting mosquito surveillance in the region&lt;/a&gt; since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d41c2" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31df0d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 'relentless biters' are spreading &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3dbf" class="body-graf"&gt;“In 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,” said Raman, who oversees the health district’s mosquito surveillance program. “A few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcbb13" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbcecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“Aedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,” Raman said. “They are just relentless biters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a88839" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad2c51" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. “All it takes is a couple inches of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838f64" class="body-graf"&gt;Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11040e" class="body-graf"&gt;Climate change is likely also a factor, and it’s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-mosquitos-tropical-disease-rcna149366" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-869c2b" class="body-graf"&gt;In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e59d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Las Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,” Messenger said. “We’re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we’re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b562f1" class="body-graf"&gt;What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1370f2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city — and thus controlling the public health risk — will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn’t one in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a6c88" class="body-graf"&gt;“You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-313aa3" class="body-graf"&gt;That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use — particularly around humans — and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e04f" class="body-graf"&gt;In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2506f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,” she said. “Nobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQY1ltWVQzYWU1MFREb3I3ZTRqZ3BzdVlFWS1Qb0hhU0lpZW9oQm5xRUZGcjgzQ1JNVTZSRzlmRXZDV0hfZWtmM2NZNlJ0akU1TlJmNlNHcnREdXk3WEczZ0dFQjNyc3gzMjBDRkZhUWYxNkRzV0YwM2l5N2QtQW5GZ05ZTHV0ck1FTmp6UE5oOFBzeVdqNlg40gFWQVVfeXFMTlVCN0FOVlBVcV9kNnFkdHh6UGVoMC1tOU1ZLU5RZ3RYdGp1ZElETU1WeW5haFRkaDR4cmdhNUxIWnJRRGprTFo1RjhjNjJSV2pYVVpra1E</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的营养学家建议在验血前停止服用这种维生素补充剂；原因如下-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While social media can be a global stage for a lot of unexpected nuisances, it also provides a platform for information sharing between professionals and people about topics that need more attention than they are getting at the moment. One such issue is a lack of knowledge about a vitamin supplement that can interfere with blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in a video going viral on the internet Dr. Amy Shah, an MD &amp;amp; Nutrition Expert, trained at Cornell, Harvard, Einstein and Columbia shared the name of a vitamin that can hamper blood tests. Her video has received about 2K likes and 84 comments, with more and more people appreciating her putting the information out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don’t know why we don’t talk about this enough. It’s really a nuisance at best and dangerous at worse. I don’t think most people know this and it’s such a common supplement/ingredient in supplements," wrote Shah in the caption of the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is such a PSA especially for all of my girlfriends because you know what? Everyone that I know is taking a hair, skin and nail supplement and a lot of them, most of them have high doses of biotin and you have to know that biotin interferes with blood testing for heart attacks like with troponin levels, with thyroid testing, with reproductive hormone testing, with parathyroid testing," said the doctor in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, imagine this, you're having chest pain, you go to the ER and they're like oh my god, you're having a heart attack because your troponin levels are elevated. But you failed to tell them that you've been taking high dose of biotin and that is the reason why the troponin was high," she explained further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So not only are we confused, we get excess blood testing, we might not diagnose it correctly. That's why I want you to know that if you are taking these things, definitely stop them before you get your blood testing about 72 hours, and if you end up in the hospital for whatever reason, let them know that you've been taking biotin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is this true?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

According to a study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5951654/#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20many,to%20unnecessary%20procedures%20and%20treatments." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, many common blood tests employ a biotin-streptavidin reaction as a part of the test procedure. While the amount of dietary biotin intake is not expected to affect these tests, biotin supplementation at doses greater than 1 mg per day can cause either falsely low or falsely high test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly dangerous for patients in emergency situations who are not aware that they are taking high doses of biotin or when the physician doesn't know that the patient is doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Interactions%20with%20Laboratory%20Tests,-Very%20high%20intakes&amp;amp;text=Even%20a%20single%2010%20mg,of%20the%20patient%20%5B32%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even a single 10 mg dose of biotin has interfered with thyroid function tests administered within 24 hours of taking the supplement. Additionally, according to the FDA a patient with a high intake of supplemental biotin died following a troponin test that gave a falsely low result because the test was subject to biotin interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Dr Shah advised if you are taking biotin supplements it is better to avoid them before blood tests and inform your physician about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>社交媒体上到处都是女性脱发的补救措施。了解如何运作-美国国家公共广播电台（ NPR ）</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNZFNBenBRMEtGSnRYWklGN25UTkFqU2ItcWJPRDdWbHBtck5uWHJWNUVkSThNQTktczZBbUhaR05tcHhQUmVBWVpGX09KUnBiZ2F1YUxYSlZuMk1HSEFjQ29EZDdmVjFJOGQ2T0VkLVNicXV3SmNkeFNuUWR3MzB6TzVFTzZSS1FzMjRwR3RlTnNZQmN4cEtRNy1KZmVsMFRBN2pobE5YZzBWeU15cFNuVnhIY0pmMnpoOVI4S0g0Z3R1R1RleDVJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For women with hair loss, there are more treatment options than ever before — and more ways to access them, as anyone scrolling social media has likely seen firsthand. But it can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For women with hair loss, there are more treatment options than ever before, and more ways to access them, as anyone scrolling social media is likely to find out. But all those choices can be confusing. NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin reports on how best to navigate the world of hair-loss remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY LUPKIN, BYLINE: When Allison Richards (ph) was little, she had long, straight blond hair, and a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALLISON RICHARDS: That was the beauty feature that people commented on. They're like, oh, your hair is so pretty. It's so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: It started thinning in her 20s and then got really bad during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARDS: There was one day, in the shower, where just I had hundreds of strands of hair. Like, fistfuls of hair coming out. It was a very scary experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: To understand hair loss, it's important to understand hair growth, says Dr. Carolyn Goh, a clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA Health. Each hair on your head goes through cycles of growth, transition and rest. The rest phase is called telogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAROLYN GOH: So it's at the end of that telogen phase is when your hair actually sheds. And when the hair's shedding, it's actually because there's a new hair growing and pushing it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: And each strand of hair does this at different times. Sometimes, however, stress, like having a baby or even COVID, can cause the hair cycles to sync up, causing a bigger shed. But it's temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOH: Mostly it's time will tell, and that's really difficult to deal with. You know, you see all this hair coming out. It is this huge change, and it seems like the world is ending. But in fact, most of the time is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: She says about half of all women will experience hair loss in their lifetime, and sometimes it doesn't resolve on its own. Goh says patients have come to her with all kinds of solutions they've seen on social media, from onion juice to rosemary oil. Goh says there is one randomized controlled study of a hundred people showing rosemary oil could work, but there's also a lot of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOH: I think somebody asked me about cucumber today, and I said, you know, I think if that worked, cucumbers would probably be $50 a pop for hair loss, you know? Someone would've figured, you know, a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: When it comes to prescription drugs, it's important to get a formal diagnosis because different kinds of hair loss respond to different treatments. But some people say their doctors can be dismissive or it can be hard to get an appointment. So telehealth companies are stepping in. Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer of Hers, says the company takes women's hair loss seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JESSICA SHEPHERD: We are going to be there when you're scrolling your phone, on commercials. That's really how we are exposed or how we introduce ourselves to our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: But Thea Chassin, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Bald Girls Do Lunch, says telehealth isn't always the answer. She has alopecia areata - an autoimmune kind of hair loss - and says a telehealth visit alone wouldn't have gotten her diagnosis right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEA CHASSIN: They don't know because even with alopecia areata, there are look-alike conditions that are completely different. For example, you could have a fungal condition, and that's treatable, but you don't want to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: New drugs to treat alopecia areata were approved in just the last few years. They're called JAK inhibitors. As for Allison Richards, who first noticed hair loss in the shower, she considers herself lucky. She was able to get to a dermatologist in person, who took her seriously. Now she takes oral minoxidil - the same compound in Rogaine but in a pill - and spironolactone. Both are being prescribed off-label, meaning they weren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hair loss. But they're working for her, and her doctor monitors her for side effects. Richards mostly wants other women like her to know they're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARDS: There's always going to be somebody to hold your hand, cheer you on. And if you ever feel like your beauty is compromised, beauty gets redefined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: Sydney Lupkin, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF VALANTE'S "RISSA")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Natural selection meant that using these new medicines gave an advantage to the microbes that could survive the assault – and a treatment that worked today could become ineffective tomorrow. A British doctor put the challenge in military terms: “We may run clean out of effective ammunition. Then how the bacteria and moulds will lord it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than 70 years later, that concern looks prescient. The UN has called antibiotic resistance “one of the most urgent global health threats”. Researchers estimate that resistance already kills &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01867-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than a million people a year&lt;/a&gt;, with that number forecast to grow. And new antibiotics are not being discovered fast enough; many that are essential today were discovered more than 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"books","tags":[{"id":"books/series/big-idea","type":"Series","title":"The big idea"},{"id":"society/antibiotics","type":"Keyword","title":"Antibiotics"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"education/medicine","type":"Keyword","title":"Medicine"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Saturday"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday/culture","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Culture"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine-books","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine books"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"books/2025/aug/17/why-antibiotics-are-like-fossil-fuels","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The thing to remember is that antibiotics are quite unlike other medicines. Most drugs work by manipulating human biology: paracetamol relieves your headache by dampening the chemical signals of pain; caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and as a result prevents drowsiness taking hold. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/antibiotics" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, target bacteria. And, because bacteria spread between people, the challenge of resistance is social: it’s as if every time you took a painkiller for your headache, you increased the chance that somebody else might have to undergo an operation without anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That makes resistance more than simply a technological problem. But like that British doctor in 1954, we still often talk as if it is: we need to invent new “weapons” to better defend ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What this framing overlooks is that the extraordinary power of antibiotics is not due to human ingenuity. In fact, the majority of them derive from substances originally made by bacteria and fungi, evolved millions of years ago in a process of microbial competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is where I can’t help thinking about another natural resource that helped create the modern world but has also been dangerously overused: fossil fuels. Just as Earth’s geological forces turned dead plants from the Carboniferous era into layers of coal and oil that we could burn for energy, so evolution created molecules that scientists in the 20th century were able to recruit to keep us alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both have offered an illusory promise of cheap, miraculous and never-ending power over nature – a promise that is now coming to an end. If we thought of antibiotics as the “fossil fuels” of modern medicine, might that change how we use them? And could it help us think of ways to make the fight against life-threatening infections more sustainable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The antibiotic era is less than a century old. Alexander Fleming first noticed the activity of a strange mould against bacteria in 1928, but it wasn’t until the late 1930s that the active ingredient – penicillin – was isolated. A daily dose was just 60mg, about the same as a pinch of salt. For several years it was so scarce it was worth more than gold. But after production was scaled up during the second world war, it ended up costing less than the bottle it came in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use it&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This abundance did more than tackle infectious diseases. Just as the energy from fossil fuels transformed society, antibiotics allowed the entire edifice of modern medicine to be built. Consider surgery: cutting people open and breaking the protective barrier of the skin gives bacteria the chance to swarm into the body’s internal tissues. Before antibiotics, even the simplest procedures frequently resulted in fatal blood poisoning. After them, so much more became possible: heart surgery, intestinal surgery, transplantation. Then there’s cancer: chemotherapy suppresses the immune system, making bacterial infections one of the most widespread complications of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The effects of antibiotics have rippled out even further: they made factory farming possible, both by reducing disease among animals kept in close quarters, and by increasing their weight through complex effects on metabolism. They’re one of the reasons for the huge increase in meat consumption since the 1950s, with all its concomitant welfare and environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the crisis of resistance, antibiotics remain cheap compared with other medicines. Partly – as with fossil fuels – this is because the negative consequences of their use (so-called externalities) are not priced in. And like coal, oil and gas, antibiotics lead to pollution. One &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/4/pgaf096/8113371?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that 31% of the 40 most used antibiotics worldwide enter rivers. Once they’re out there, they increase levels of resistance in environmental bacteria: one study of soil from the Netherlands showed that the incidence of some antibiotic-resistant genes had &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es901221x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased by more than 15 times&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s. Another source of pollution is manufacturing, particularly in countries such as India. In Hyderabad, where factories produce huge amounts of antibiotics for the global market, scientists have found that the wastewater contains levels of some antibiotics that are a million times higher than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Like the climate crisis, antibiotic resistance has laid global inequalities bare. Some high-income countries have taken steps to decrease antibiotic use, but only after benefiting from their abundance in the past. That makes it hard for them to take a moral stand against their use in other places, a dilemma that mirrors the situation faced by post-industrial nations urging developing nations to forgo the economic benefits of cheap energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This may be where the similarities end. While we look forward to the day when fossil fuels are phased out completely, that’s clearly not the case with antibiotics, which are always going to be part of medicine’s “energy mix”. After all, most deaths from bacterial disease worldwide are due to lack of access to antibiotics, not resistance. What we are going to need to do is make our approach to development and use much more sustainable. Currently, many pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antibiotics: it’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That means we need alternative models. One proposal is for governments to fund an international institute that develops publicly owned antibiotics, rather than relying on the private sector; another is to incentivise development with generously funded prizes for antibiotic discovery. And to address the issue of overuse, economists have suggested that health authorities could run “subscription” models that remove the incentive to sell lots of antibiotics. In one pilot scheme in England, two companies are &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/antimicrobial-products-subscription-model-guidance-on-commercial-arrangements/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;being paid a set amount&lt;/a&gt; per year by the NHS, regardless of how much of their product is actually used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finally, we have to remember that antibiotics aren’t the only game in town. Supporting other, “renewable” approaches means we get to use the ones we do have for longer. Vaccines are vital to disease prevention – with every meningitis, diphtheria or whooping cough vaccine meaning a potential course of antibiotics forgone. And the 20th century’s largest reductions in infectious disease occurred not because of antibiotics, but thanks to better sanitation and public health. (Even in the 2000s, the threat of MRSA was addressed with tried-and-tested methods such as handwashing and cleaning protocols – not new antibiotics.) Given that antibiotics themselves emerged unexpectedly, we should also be investing more in blue-skies research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Just as we no longer burn coal without a thought for the consequences, the era of carefree antibiotic use is now firmly in the past. In both cases, the idea that there wouldn’t be a reckoning was always an illusion. But as with our slow waking up to the reality of the climate crisis, coming to appreciate the limits of our love affair with antibiotics may ultimately be no bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Liam Shaw is a biologist at the University of Oxford, and author of &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/dangerous-miracle-9781847927545/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dangerous Miracle&lt;/a&gt; (Bodley Head).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="further-reading" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/being-mortal-9781846685828/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End &lt;/a&gt;by Atul Gawande (Profile, £11.99)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/infectious-9780861544394/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Infectious: Pathogens and How We Fight Them&lt;/a&gt; by John S Tregoning (Oneworld, £10.99)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/deadly-companions-9780198815440/#tab-product-detailshttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzQbgcTxNtVgGQpnfJXLDxRcZsWM" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Deadly Companions: How Microbes Shaped our History&lt;/a&gt; by Dorothy H Crawford (Oxford, £12.49)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 11:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPd3QxSHJIX3VQbHNIRzVUTHpCa3hpUFpoQ0UteFVyZVZTY2JMdk9VbzNDNm5ZRThBaHpsRVVnLUNWTVFjS1FfUkVIY0ZoU1R5cDRWRkEtbFVSc0c0OWRtcGlLZk1LMjVOdlNUUHZHanZVRm53SmhKUFk3bU1xQk0wcnJDbmdpcHVkR0M4</guid></item><item><title>这些美国人厌倦了美国的医疗保健费用，搬到了国外-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPbHY1V2JWdFNQT2hCSGNJUDJ5aHAtUHE2ZVp0TXhDZ1FNX3E5NVhNVmUyQi1hdGdwV0NDRmloeV9mWXFOMVJHNlJTWTNTU25lSDU0ekhJS0NMMHpRSUM3T2RILW82S19xVVlPdS0xYjFVZTlQc084Yko4ekEtdWx2dU9zMkVoQzhrbEIwTjk4bXo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JXS5SMTKZAD5D2VBJZOBZRDDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Jennifer Sontag cracked her skull and couldn’t afford emergency brain surgery.

(Good, we imagine? It’s still sex!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery surrounding sex in older age stems from a combination of factors, according to &lt;a href="https://drshannonchavez.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Shannon Chavez" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drshannonchavez.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Shannon Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist in Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, societal taboos and ageist attitudes have led to a marginalization of older adults’ sexuality. No one wants to imagine people their grandparents’ or parents’ age having sex, so we cast out those thoughts. What we get as a result are limited discussions and representations of sex in later life; think of how few scenes we see of older people getting it on in movies and TV, and how often post-50 sex and Viagra are the butt of the joke for late-night comedians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all going to get older eventually (hopefully, anyway) but because we’ve stigmatized post-50 sex so much, we’re ill-prepared for the realities of it, Chavez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lack of comprehensive sex education tailored to older age groups, leaving many individuals uninformed about the changes and challenges they may face regarding sexuality as they age,” she told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This all leads to misconceptions and curiosity about what sexual experiences are like in later life,” she said. “Overall, increased awareness, education, and open dialogue about sex and aging can help eliminate the mystery and promote healthier attitudes toward sexuality in older age groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heartening reality is that those who are AARP-aged are still having, enjoying and desiring sex, even when they’re not coupled up. Four out of 10 people ages 65-80 are still sexually active, &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sex-after-65-poll-finds-gender-differences-lack-communication" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to a 2018 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sex-after-65-poll-finds-gender-differences-lack-communication" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;according to a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from the &lt;a href="http://healthyagingpoll.org/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Poll on Healthy Aging" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://healthyagingpoll.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;National Poll on Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;. And whether or not they have an active sex life, nearly two-thirds of older adults said they’re interested in sex. More than half said sex is important to their quality of life, according to the same study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shed some light on post-70 sex, we asked sex therapists and people over 70 to share some things people should know about sex in the golden years. See what they had to say below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your need to feel desired doesn’t just disappear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can only speak for my wife and I, but I think one of the biggest things not talked about is the drive for sex and physical enjoyment ― to be desired, to be wanted, to have that feeling of giving and receiving the physical, as well as emotional release ― never goes away.

But it’s great to be alive at a time when science has solved some of these issues with easy solutions. Drugs and creams for both women and men, as well as physical exercises and therapies, make it possible to enjoy sex at this late stage. I understand that there are many people at this age who have debilitating diseases or physical limitations that make it very difficult or even undesirable to have sex. And I certainly respect that. But there are also many older people, older than us even, who still want and have sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest problem is the stigma of being old, with gray hair or bald, saggy breasts and butts, means that there’s no longer a need for sex. When we were in our 50s, we thought that if we were alive in our 70s, we’d be done. To our pleasant surprise, it’s just the opposite.” ― &lt;em&gt;Frank, 76, who lives in the Texas panhandle and has been married for almost 53 years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: blackCAT via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;blackCAT via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;People AARP-aged are still having sex, enjoying sex and desiring sex, even when they're not coupled up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The frequency decreases but the quality often increases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the most surprising thing about sex after 70 for many folks is that it has the potential to be better than ever. Many of my clients in their 70s (and 80s!) report that while the frequency of sex generally declines with age, the quality improves. Sometimes this is related to so-called sexual dysfunction which leads them to discover new pathways to pleasure. For example, if penetration is painful or uncomfortable, they often learn to explore and enjoy full-body pleasure. Or if erectile issues arise, many folks finally discover that the hands, tongue, lips, toys and skin can lead to intense pleasure and orgasms in the absence of penile erections.” ― &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sexwithdrjess.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jess O’Reilly" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sexwithdrjess.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Jess O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, a sexologist and the host of the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0sL5FqZrxCAa94DhntIm5M" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sex With Dr. Jess podcast " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://open.spotify.com/show/0sL5FqZrxCAa94DhntIm5M" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Sex With Dr. Jess podcast &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erectile dysfunction doesn’t need to end your sex life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve dealt with ED for over 20 years.

Also, being open to experimenting and adapting to the changing needs of one’s body can help older adults continue to engage in pleasurable sexual activities.

Adventurousness and imagination expand with experience. I may be different from other people, but I find myself giving myself permission to explore and be interested in diverse activities even more than when I was younger. When you get toward the end of your life you realize the rules don’t matter as much anymore, including in bed. No one is going to give you a disapproving glance and no one is going to discourage you from doing something you want to do and, really, who cares if they do?” ―&lt;em&gt; David Daniel, a 70-something in Cedar Rapids, Iowa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be painful, especially for women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aging process has a tremendous impact on sexual functioning and satisfaction. In addition, as we age, we tend to have more medical issues and many medications can impact sexual function. As we age, we often experience changes in our sexual behavior, desire, what we find arousing, and overall sexual well-being. Some of the biological changes we experience as we age involve hormones: When women reach middle age, they experience &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. This happens because the body stops producing estrogen. Some of the results of decreased estrogen production include vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication, and loss of elasticity in the vaginal tissues. This often leads to discomfort and even pain during intercourse. In some cases, there may be a decrease in nipple and clitoral sensitivity.

It doesn’t seem like they’re exaggerating: Older research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt; analyzed water samples from 31 pools and hot tubs and discovered that a 220,000-gallon pool contained about 20 gallons of pee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the odds of you swimming in pee this summer are high. While peeing in the pool is gross, is it really all that bad? What can happen if you or someone around you does this just once? In the name of science, we tapped a toxicologist, infectious disease physician and microbiologist to break it all down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you pee in a pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things. The big issue is the interaction of urine with the chemicals in the pool. “When human urine combines with chemicals that are present in chlorinated swimming pools, potentially harmful compounds called disinfection byproducts, or DBPs, can form,” said &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor,&lt;/a&gt; a toxicologist at MedStar Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The more organic matter in the pool, the more chloramines are produced (that includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Urine naturally contains nitrogen-containing compounds like urea, ammonia and creatinine, Johnson-Arbor explained. “These nitrogen-rich compounds can react with chlorine or other disinfectants found in swimming pools to form DBPs that can cause harmful health effects.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chlorine specifically forms something called chloramines when it binds to human waste products (like pee) in the pool, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These chloramines can build up in the water and off-gas into the air. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just a urine thing. “Chlorine interacts with many kinds of organic matter,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Thomas Melendy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thomas Melendy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, and biochemistry in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo in New York. “The reason it’s put in pools is to act as an antibacterial and antiviral. It helps to keep the pool clean and noninfectious.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big of a deal is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on how you look at it. “From an infectious disease point of view, peeing in a well-chlorinated pool doesn’t really present a problem. That’s not to be confused with pooping in the pool, which does,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Thomas Russo," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo. While &lt;a href="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="urine isn’t sterile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;urine isn’t sterile&lt;/a&gt;, most people don’t carry major pathogens in their pee that chlorine can’t handle, Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But chloramines can be an issue, according to Melendy. “Any time chlorine interacts with organic matter, it makes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; chloramines,” he said. “The more chloramines that are produced,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the higher the risk of skin, eye and lung irritation.” (This can be a bigger problem in people with underlying respiratory issues such as asthma, he said.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If ventilation in an area isn’t great, chloramines that off-gas from the water will settle on the water’s surface, where they can cause symptoms, according to the CDC. One of those chloramines is trichloramine, a volatile chemical that evaporates easily into the air and causes that signature “chlorine” smell in swimming pools, Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more organic matter in th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e pool, the more chloramines are produced, Melendy said. (That includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles.) This also inactivates the chlorine, he points out. “The more organic matter you introduce to the pool, the less effective chlorine is at being an antibacterial because it gets used up,” Melendy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you pee in a saltwater pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact is likely the same, Johnson-Arbor said. “Saltwater pools use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="electrochemically generated chlorine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;electrochemically generated chlorine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; instead of liquid chlorine for disinfection,” Johnson-Arbor said. (Electrochemically generated chlorine happens after an electric current is passed through a concentrated salt solution.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Since this process still generates chlorine, any nitrogen-containing matter that is present in a saltwater pool can still combine with the chlorine to generate DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if only one person pees in the pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you really have to go and there’s no bathroom nearby, it’s fair to wonder how much of an issue it will be if just one person pees in the pool. “It’s a matter of concentration,” Melendy said. “There’s so much chlorine and water in the pool. If just one pers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on pees in a very large pool, it’s unli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;kely to create a significant irritant.” (However, he points out that sensitivity varies from person to person.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If it’s one person in a really small pool, it might have a significant impact,” Melendy said. “Conversely, if it’s a big pool and a lot of people are doing it, i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;t’s going to produce lots of chloramine gases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a nuanced thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johnson-Arbor also pointed out that this isn’t just a urine issue. Sweat and poop particles inevitably slip off your skin and into the water, too. “In addition, if individuals do not shower before entering pools, their loose hairs and skin cells can transfer from their bodies into the pool, further contributing to development of DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: “When you eat an avocado, it’s not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together.

It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

&lt;p&gt;On the coast of Acadia National Park in Maine, a lone seal suns itself ahead of me in a little nook on the rocky shore. I’ve never seen a seal in real life before. She is silky white and grey, with her belly out in the sun and her flipper tilted up. I’ve spent the past day bopping around Bar Harbor with my friend, making jokes about curing my depression with day drinking and lobster rolls and the cool Maine air. I feel okay. I’m six weeks back on Zoloft, which has been terrible, but at least my Adam Sandler meets Caroline Bessette Kennedy outfit isn’t pinching anywhere on my matronly body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine makes me remember my high school East Coast Ivy aspirations but the memories feel like a movie I watched, not my own life. I try to find them in me, the me here now, but the only thing that’s left is maybe the desire to plant some hydrangeas where they won’t get scorched by the North Carolina sun when I get home. On the rugged coastline, I watch the tide come in below me in surges of clear North Atlantic water, turning the submerged green plants into a color richer and more sparkling than fine jewels. I’ve been thinking about fairy tales and motherhood, who I’ve been and wondering who I might still become–or if that’s even possible at 38? It must be, but it is very hard for me to imagine–and now, watching the seal sun herself, I think about the Selkie Wife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="h-postpartum-depression-amp-the-selkie-wife-a-story-of-motherhood-and-losing-and-finding-myself"&gt;Postpartum Depression &amp;amp; the Selkie Wife: A Story of Motherhood and Losing (and Finding) Myself&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Selkie Wife is a fairy tale about a creature that can shapeshift between a woman and a seal, and who is forced into marriage as a human woman when her seal skin is stolen. Unable to return to the ocean without her skin, she lives life on land, staring longingly into the sea despite her husband and children on shore. In the story, she eventually finds her seal skin—or has it returned to her by her children—and leaves for the ocean. Like the Selkie Wife, I imagine myself slipping into these cold, clear waves where my fat is turned to sleekness and the waters are deep and dark. I imagine myself swimming very far away where it is silent and I am alone. I’m committed to living, as I’ve told all my care providers in the weeks leading up to this trip, but I understand the Selkie Wife. Some call it post-partum depression, or “the baby blues,” but for me, it is an inexplicable grief I am reborn into with each child. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Partum Depression is one of those tedious subjects no one really wants to read about—not even me—which never makes an auspicious subject for writing. When you are pregnant, the doctors make you fill out the depression and anxiety screener sheet every time they ask you to pee in a cup—so, I’m already weary of the topic. Beyond that, depression is boring. Someone else’s depression is even less interesting than their dreams. Like menopause or incontinence or anything involving your pelvic floor, post-partum depression ends up getting muddled through, privately, in our own mundane ways, none of which is interesting or pathological enough to warrant an essay. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise to my doctors or therapists I am depressed, but it is somehow always a surprise to me. I’m one of those lucky people that gets the pre-disposition to it via genes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; trauma. Like having mommy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; daddy issues. A yeast infection &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bacterial vaginosis. But there is a part of me that still fundamentally misunderstands depression as a lack of will to live or a question of my vitality. I’m always semi-delusional like no no, you don’t understand, I want to do and be all these things, I’m depressed because I can’t and I’m not!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Science mostly explains that post-partum depression is due to the hormone progesterone drop within the three days after birth, and while I understand it, I have a hard time accepting it. If post-partum depression was simply a matter of hormones, then when my hormones regulated, so would I! I shouldn’t be two years out in a sea of grief. When I start looking at the timeline, it is admittedly more complicated than those three days to level out progesterone. The other hormones involved in pregnancy go back to normal levels three to six &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; after birth. But if you breastfeed (like I did), those don’t go back until three to six months after &lt;em&gt;weaning.&lt;/em&gt; This means, if you breastfeed for one year (the recommendation), you can expect to be hormonally disrupted for up to 18 months. And then, just because your hormone levels return to pre-pregnancy, that doesn’t mean your body does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this superficially, of course. I’m somehow sweatier now and I can’t budge my weight lower than 20lbs over my pre-pregnancy self. My hair has fallen out and regrown, leaving a wild demarcation line of regrowth. Then there’s the changes from my three other children–the stretch marks under my arms and knees and belly from the swelling in pre-eclampsia, the loose skin that just waits for the next pregnancy or death, and the softness in my breasts. But it’s deeper than flesh. Your child’s DNA—DNA that is totally separate from yours—stays in your body after pregnancy. Starting as early as six weeks, the DNA from your child migrates into your body and can stay there a lifetime. This foreign DNA can have positive and/or negative effects on things like wound healing, lactation, thyroid function, autoimmune disease, cancer and maternal emotional, and psychological health (&lt;a class="" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26316378"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). And during breastfeeding? The milk isn’t just flowing out: immune information is flowing back into your body—changing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; immune profile for years to come. I feel this as a kind of body horror, not empowerment. It feels like becoming a mother is to become a chimera–a single organism composed of different genetic identities. Each time I give birth, I am reborn as a new and far stranger creature. Four children later, there is no part of me that feels like myself. I do not even know my own face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My youngest son and current reason for traveling through this post-partum wasteland of self, is two-and-a-half. He is a lover and rubs my arm, all night long, even in his deep sleep. He hates my moles and will hone in on one or two that are directly in his rubbing path to try and pick off. Before the Selkie Wife, before the Zoloft, lying there bleeding while trying to put him to sleep, I thought a lot about changelings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fairy tales, a changeling is the substitute left behind when a human is stolen by the fae. The substitute can be a piece of wood, spelled to resemble the stolen human or a deformed or ravenous creature with the human’s face. It is frequently a child who cries all the time or acts too old for their age or uncanny in some way. Nearly all those fairy tales tell a story of a child being replaced, not the mother. I keep imagining myself being substituted by someone else—someone who wears my skin, and my face, but that both me and my baby recognize is not me. It goes like this–one day I go to pick up my son and he reaches to rub his mother’s familiar moles but finds them no longer there, only smooth, perfect skin. Gasp, horror. An &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; mother, a changeling mother, has taken my place. She will try to soothe him just the same, but he knows—he knows something is wildly wrong. This is not his mother, she is only wearing her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I imagine this other mother is better than me—placid, less sweaty, less the extra twenty pounds swaddling her belly. I imagine her in chic, flowing white while she feeds the baby organic fruits and never screams back. I feel the horror in the imaginary story from my child’s perspective—of finding the dynamic warmth of your messy, sweaty mother and her witchy moles replaced by cool, smooth perfection. I take the Zoloft to fix my brain chemistry, but it can never fix the part of my grief that is rooted in finding that I cannot substitute a better, more perfect being as the mother of my children. They’ve only got me—my mistakes, my insecurities, my struggles, and my moles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I look at it through a Jungian lens, where every element or character in this scene is a reflection of myself, I can see that this imaginary tableau reveals both my longing for another—&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;—mother to take my place, but also my horror at not recognizing myself in the role of mother at all. When I look in the mirror these days, I don’t see myself at all. I see someone’s sad mom–sweaty and chubby and unnecessary. I have no idea who she is and even when I try to care for her, I feel like I get it all wrong and I long for the foaming tide and the shimmer of my sealskin. I just want to unzip myself out of this terrible form and go back to the dark water where the stars seem to touch the horizon and nobody needs me to find their soccer socks. But to go back to the sealskin is to leave my children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Maine, my baby refused to Facetime me. He was determined to wait it out until I got home and he could rub my arm instead. What I’m about to admit makes me a terrible mother, I know. But when I leave my children, I don’t really miss them all that much. I truthfully don’t think about them unless I’m telling someone about them or anxious about the person I’ve left to care for them, or replying to their texts. I don’t resonate with descriptions of the relationship to my children in terms of someone who is part of me or someone whom I am always longing for. It is simply that these are the people I care most about. The closest I’ve ever or will ever allow anyone to reach me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of my comfort with leaving is knowing I will return. I am committed, after all. The selkie wife can shapeshift—she could come back to her children on the shore–but in no version does she leave the water again. It is a difficult part of the story for me. It feels so cut and dry–couldn’t she have split the difference? And I think that’s what I end up trying at this point post-partum–to belong both fully to myself while also belonging fully to my children. But no matter how physically I can divide it, spiritually there is something zero sum about motherhood. No matter how much me and my partner strive for 50/50 or how much I organize things to give myself time away, I feel like a battery that must be drained for anyone else to be filled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to blame society for this zero-sum situation. There’s so much to blame–the lack of substantive support, the way we force new parents to go back to work right away, the white-Victorian ideals of motherhood and the way this version of capitalism puts the responsibility of surviving entirely on individuals and then prunes back our opportunities to do so. But like hormones, while I can explain my post-partum struggles this way, I feel like it’s an incomplete answer. I’ve had four wildly different pregnancies, births and circumstances. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom and a working mom, a single one and a married one, a poor one and a middle-class one. The consistent thread in all of them is that I am most vulnerable to depression when reality collides with my vulnerable post-partum self. Each time, I’ve left the water in the form of a woman of my own volition, like the Selkie does, but it’s when I realize my sealskin has been stolen and I am now fixed to this shore that the grief overwhelms me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most interpretations of the Selkie Wife view the husband in the fairy tale as the patriarchal villain, stealing her sealskin and pinning her against her will to the shore. But in truth, I am my own husband. I am the one who wanted this, who longed to be here, who committed, ruthlessly, to being a mother. I am the one who stuffed my seal skin into the chimney to keep it safe, and who takes it out in the dead of night to move it again. The husband part of me is &lt;em&gt;committed&lt;/em&gt; to them in a way I’ve never been committed to myself. I don’t think I would have ever had the courage to leave my abusive family or ex-husband if I hadn’t done it for my children. I wouldn’t be so driven to succeed if they weren’t depending entirely on me. My commitment to living is really a commitment to mothering. But that’s the whole crux of motherhood that I end up mourning each time, the thing hormones and society cannot explain: once you’ve met yourself on that shore, you can never wholly belong to yourself again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I leave the seal to her waters and fly back home the same day my middle two leave for their week-long youth service trips. While my youngest one is happily reunited with my moles, it is a long week before my older ones return to me. I am in different seasons of motherhood at the same time and I start seeing something new. For these older children, the season is turning, and the moon is rising into the dark and they’ve started slipping away into the depths of the sea. They come back with their hair wet and their faces shining and I meet them on the shore and can only know what they want to tell me. Somehow, when we shapeshift and slide into those waters, we are each alone. It is only on land where I can meet my children and they me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worst answer–the one that I hate because it leaves me in this sweaty, miserable mess–is that there is no answer. That this is an inherent tension in being human. We cannot substitute better versions of ourselves. To live in community, perhaps we can only meet each other on the shore, where we then no longer belong wholly to ourselves. That after giving birth I become so much more sensitive and aware of the world, deeply feeling all its tensions both around and inside me, and this demands both medication and tenderness. I slip back into the routine of taking my meds, working, ubering my children everywhere, carrying my screaming toddler out of Target, and scheduling time with my partner for meetings and for a moment to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s only one part of the Selkie Wife that I still wonder about–her child in the fairy stories who finds the sealskin and returns it to his mother, thereby setting her free. Even though it feels impossible to ever find a young and new part of me, I have a vague recollection of feeling exactly this old, exactly this matronly and sad with my first at the age of twenty-two. So I hang on to hope that there is still some part of me that will return with its gifts of youth and freedom, like a tide that always returns to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500830122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, provide evidence that aversive societal conditions are linked to the development of personality traits associated with callousness, exploitation, and moral disregard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of more than 1.7 million individuals across 183 countries and over 140,000 people from all 50 U.S. states, researchers found a consistent, though modest, association between adverse societal conditions and higher levels of what psychologists refer to as the “Dark Factor of Personality.” This general factor reflects a tendency to prioritize one’s own interests while disregarding—or even causing—harm to others, often accompanied by beliefs that justify such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark personality traits refer to enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are socially and ethically aversive. These include traits like narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and spitefulness. Although each trait emphasizes different features—such as callousness in psychopathy or manipulativeness in Machiavellianism—research over the past decade suggests they share a common core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shared disposition, termed the Dark Factor of Personality (or simply “D”), is thought to reflect a general tendency to pursue personal gain at the expense of others, underpinned by beliefs that such behavior is justifiable. For example, someone high in D might believe that “everyone looks out for themselves” or that “most people deserve what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as intelligence researchers have identified a “g” factor that underlies cognitive ability, personality researchers argue that D underlies all dark traits. People high in D are more likely to behave dishonestly, seek revenge, exploit others, and rationalize unethical behavior. But what shapes the development of this psychological tendency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study hypothesized that certain adverse social environments might foster the development of darker personality profiles. They refer to these as “aversive societal conditions” (ASC), measured by four factors: corruption, economic inequality, poverty, and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that in settings where exploitation, injustice, and insecurity are common, self-interested behavior might be perceived not only as acceptable but as necessary for survival. In such societies, people may learn that others cannot be trusted, that cheating pays off, or that harming others is a legitimate way to get ahead. Over time, such beliefs may become internalized and crystallize into stable personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was motivated by “an intertwining between theoretical and pragmatic reasons,” according to lead author Ingo Zettler of the University of Copenhagen. “Theoretically, there have always been ideas that societal conditions contribute to the proliferation of certain personality traits in a society, but research has not looked too much into very aversive (or antisocial) personality characteristics so far. Pragmatically, we were able to collect survey responses from close to two million people from more than 180 countries, which, we believe, is a good data set to explore whether aversive societal conditions also relate to the proliferation of aversive personality characteristics across societies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created an index of aversive societal conditions across countries and U.S. states using publicly available data. Importantly, they focused on how these conditions looked about 20 years before personality data were collected, to examine whether long-term exposure during formative years predicted later personality tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on a massive dataset of individuals who voluntarily completed the Dark Factor of Personality questionnaire through an online platform, which offers feedback on personality. (&lt;a href="https://qst.darkfactor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;You can take the test here&lt;/a&gt;.) After applying various quality control checks and matching participants’ self-reported country with geolocated IP data, the final sample included 1,791,542 people from 183 countries, and a separate sample of 144,576 individuals across 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person completed a validated short version of the D questionnaire. Items included statements such as “My own pleasure is all that matters” and “People who mess with me always regret it.” Participants rated how much they agreed or disagreed with each item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each country and state, the researchers calculated an ASC index based on corruption, income inequality, poverty rates, and homicide rates from 2000–2004. These measures were combined using principal component analysis to create a single score reflecting how aversive the local societal conditions were at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilevel regression analyses revealed that individuals living in countries or states with higher ASC scores tended to have higher D scores. While the effect sizes were small, the findings were statistically significant and consistent across both the international sample and the 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that average levels of dark personality traits varied systematically across U.S. states, with certain regions consistently scoring higher on the Dark Factor of Personality than others. States such as Nevada, New York, Texas, Louisiana, California, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee were among those with the highest average D scores. These states also tended to have higher levels of aversive societal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, states such as Vermont, Utah, New Hampshire, Oregon, Maine, Alaska, Minnesota, Idaho, Montana, and Colorado had the lowest average D scores in the sample. These states generally exhibited more favorable socioecological conditions during the early 2000s, with lower levels of violence, corruption, and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did expect to find a link between aversive societal conditions and the proliferation of aversive personality characteristics, but it was nice to see this replicating within the same country,” Zettler told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that people’s personality traits—specifically those related to selfishness, moral disengagement, and interpersonal harm—are not only shaped by individual or genetic factors but also by the broader social environment. This supports the view that personality development is sensitive to socioecological conditions, particularly during adolescence and early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In societies marked by widespread corruption and violence, people may learn that exploiting others is normal or even necessary. Over time, repeated exposure to such environments may promote beliefs and behaviors that align with the Dark Factor of Personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that this association was stronger among younger individuals and in societies that emphasize individualism. These patterns suggest that cultural values and developmental timing may moderate the influence of aversive societal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also held up when using alternative measures of societal aversiveness, such as an index of rule violations (including tax evasion and fraudulent politics), providing further support for the link between harsh environments and the proliferation of dark traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say there are two main take-aways,” Zettler said. “First, the average levels of aversive personality characteristics differ across societies. While there are also many differences between people within the same society, there are also differences between societies. Second, reducing aversive conditions in one’s society does not only facilitate the life for several people in the society, but might also reduce the likelihood of very aversive (or selfish) individuals in this society in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s scale is impressive, there are still some caveats to consider. First, the researchers used online convenience samples, meaning the participants were not randomly selected and may not fully represent the general population. Second, although the analysis accounts for time lags to reduce the risk of reverse causality, the data are still correlational. This means the findings point to an association—not a definitive causal link—between adverse environments and dark personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is the potential variability in the quality of the societal data used to build the ASC index. For example, some countries may underreport corruption or violence, which could influence the accuracy of the index. The researchers also acknowledge that they do not know how long participants had lived in their stated country or state, making it difficult to determine the duration of exposure to aversive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to further research on how environments interact with personality development. “We are continuing in trying to better understand the development of the D factor, as well as how it expresses in certain behavior in certain situations (e.g., based on different situational affordances),” Zettler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500830122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aversive societal conditions explain differences in ‘dark’ personality across countries and US states&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Ingo Zettler, Lau Lilleholt, Martina Bader, Benjamin E.

My name is Kaitlin Reilly, and I’m here to round up this week’s best wellness tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Are you drinking less these days — or just more carefully considering how much you imbibe? If so, you’re not alone: A recent Gallup poll found that many Americans are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/record-number-americans-see-moderate-103548097.html" data-ylk="slk:rethinking their relationship with alcohol;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;rethinking their relationship with alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. Today 53% of U.S. adults say moderate drinking is bad for your health, compared with just 28% in 2015. The increase is driven largely by young adults, but older adults are also more likely than ever to view even one or two drinks a day as risky. That leads to less drinking overall, with the Gallup poll finding that reported drinking by Americans was among the lowest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could be behind this change? It may have to do with &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/alcohol-good-bad-heres-experts-123044393.html" data-ylk="slk:shifting guidelines and attitudes around imbibing;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shifting guidelines and attitudes around imbibing&lt;/a&gt; from public health officials.

That’s because as you get closer to bedtime, the body becomes “less efficient at handling sugar, so late meals can lead to higher blood sugar and may disrupt sleep in some people,” dietitian Michelle Routhenstein explains. Plus, research has shown that people who eat dinner earlier are more likely to lose weight, while people eating later are more likely to gain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still feel hungry post-dinner?

Not only will it squash “horrible morning breath,” dentist Steven Katz says, but it will also “remove the plaque and bacteria that developed overnight.” Plus, dentist Anjali Rajpal says that brushing with toothpaste before you eat protects your teeth from acid (like in a morning glass of OJ) by coating your teeth with “protective fluoride, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate or other minerals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/woman_running_facing_right_dark_skin_tone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🏃🏿‍♀️‍➡️;cpos:29;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🏃🏿‍♀️‍➡️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Work out twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Only have time to work out a couple of days a week, like on the weekend?

This follows &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:32;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62450870/weekend-exercise-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous research;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:32;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that shows that exercising on weekends offers the same reduced risk of 264 diseases as sweating it out during the week. While staying active as often as you can is ideal, if you’re strapped for time, squeeze in as much exercise as you can when you have a few free hours: Go for a spin class or hike with friends instead of brunch, or run around with your kids at a park instead of heading to the movie theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/canned-food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🥫;cpos:33;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🥫&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pick healthier versions of ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have a bad rap — &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ultra-processed-foods-linked-higher-174518565.html" data-ylk="slk:and for good reason;cpos:34;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;and for good reason&lt;/a&gt;. But a new report from the American Heart Association says not all of them are the same. While the organization recommends cutting back on these types of foods — think highly processed meats like hot dogs and sausages, as well as packaged cookies, chips and pastries — healthier options include “certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces and nut- or bean-based spreads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, though, the problem with ultra-processed foods is that they can contain high amounts of fat, sugar and sodium and not enough nutrients, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/beating-maha-punch-american-heart-090042557.html" data-ylk="slk:CNN;cpos:35;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports.

The movements are based on the ones you’d find in a traditional Pilates class, except using a wall to improve stability, support and resistance. One move to try at home is the “roll-up,” in which you lie on your back with feet flexed against a wall and arms overhead. Exhale as you curl up and reach toward your toes, then repeat for eight reps at a time. Your abs may burn, but you’ll get stronger with every move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxQbXlhUHBUTzlKNGNwbTIyOXJxN0NBU3hYNkdMeWJuWEZGZk1tOWZydUdZSzRsc1dQbnZrSFdLdlFtMGdiVXJyTFp3eVIxQ25vRUJlWGYzSVBudVhIVDZUcVJvOTY3cjdEMjJSVjZpZVhtbTJiTG8tcXZJWW4tUW1FRFp4UmR3TUh0aDgyRVJUR0otbHh5VC1LenpndjBSSE5LbUcybndYTEc3bzRhVzllcEh5Tl81ejhGZllkamxhRFBsdW9kUVFqaHpGaENHUUtLeE1naVpsYU81QzNJdGVZOU5QQ3ZreXhQSTFSVXpqVEI0UlRzQ2RUSjZ2bXRZLXVNUTJTejNhamc</guid></item><item><title>蓝光对睡眠的危害程度如何？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNTHRnNmxDQ1ZEd2lqMkVnQnFHbkhiTkYxb3Jid05mWWlMRjY5Sk5WTE5BdUhHaFdUU2tmNXY5UXVoZVpfQUgxTkxaRDZSY0IyVmpwRE9YYjZSaTRpM2NKNnQxckxyYkc3dDRJU19OWi1LRHBfYnJ2djM1bk1VRTFybEVkb1ZVcFBW?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNTHRnNmxDQ1ZEd2lqMkVnQnFHbkhiTkYxb3Jid05mWWlMRjY5Sk5WTE5BdUhHaFdUU2tmNXY5UXVoZVpfQUgxTkxaRDZSY0IyVmpwRE9YYjZSaTRpM2NKNnQxckxyYkc3dDRJU19OWi1LRHBfYnJ2djM1bk1VRTFybEVkb1ZVcFBW</guid></item><item><title>为什么有些人在癌症治疗后会长出“化疗卷发” ？ - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQTjEtSmppeUdOQm9iM0NYVUJ1STFmQzJZY1N4QU56T2FFX1c1cnU5MDhlNThLWlFneGlpYW4yZ1JTWjl1LXpLQmY3OGcyWGlRc0VVTDNqLXR6bHJKN2J3R2VJZjhQYXdQclp1OEVmMFhJQ2o5QW5uVGwteFpIZnFiaG8tZDg0dVhvLXZTbGhyQklxWC1zY1g4RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71"&gt;​​Hair is an important part of our personal identity, so its loss during cancer treatment can be distressing at an already difficult time. However, this can be a positive sign that chemotherapy is working, and the hair usually grows back after treatment, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Desmond Tobin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatological scientist&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;at University College Dublin's Charles Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair can look different after &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tobin said. "In the vast majority of cases, post-treatment the hair regrows well and similar to the way it was before," he told Live Science. "But in the early stages of recovery, the hair texture and appearance may change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71-2"&gt;The most commonly reported difference by patients who have completed chemotherapy is "chemo curls" — hair that regrows as curly when it had previously been straight. Usually, this changed hair returns to its original form within about a year, Tobin said. But why does hair grow back differently after chemotherapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="02090f8a-9b67-4db6-9ef4-71b145c2ad81"&gt;To explain "chemo curls," first we need to understand how hair grows normally. Individual human hairs are long fibers of dead skin cells, composed mainly of keratin proteins,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sunny Wong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, told Live Science. Each strand is created by a hair follicle — a complex factory of different cell types — which passes through a constant cycle of growth, rest and shedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d7c118b1-4e3d-428d-a168-a2c292f8aa18"&gt;We're born with all of the hair follicles we will ever have, Tobin said. But a mixture of factors — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition and fluctuating hormone levels during the different stages of life — means that the appearance of hair is constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigments control hair color: The production of sex hormones at the onset of puberty causes fair hair to darken, and pigment loss with age &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lightens hair to gray&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or white later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can gray hair be reversed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the shape of the hair follicles determines the shape — and, therefore, texture — of each fiber, with circular follicles producing straight hair, flattened oval follicles creating coiled hair, and a follicle somewhere in between giving looser waves or curls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-591b7722-97b5-4798-9697-9bbf176a1928" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-chemo-changes-hair-3"&gt;How chemo changes hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="340a83d0-ac5c-4703-af89-e2a23876d0b7"&gt;So what are chemotherapy drugs doing to these hair follicles? &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treatments target rapidly dividing cells so the hair follicles, which also contain stem cells to act as fuel for hair growth, are particularly vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hair follicle is one of the most proliferative and actively dividing tissues in the body, probably second to the bone marrow or gut, so it's preferentially attacked," Tobin said. "That causes the hair follicle to go into a hyper-stress response." Chemotherapy therefore halts the hair cycle, forcing these follicles to expel fibers during the growth stage or shift them into a dormant phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, post-treatment, the stem cells within the individual hair follicles begin to wake up. The cycle gradually starts again, which enables the hair to regrow, but sometimes with a slightly altered appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chemotherapeutic exposure will damage the existing hair follicle and may turn it into an abnormal shape so it produces a fiber of a different shape or length, maybe thinner," Tobin explained. "It depends on how that hair follicle copes with the impact of the drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the effect of chemotherapy on other bodily systems — such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endocrine system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for making hormones — can temporarily alter the production of pigments, leading to a change in hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the complexity of factors determining hair's appearance makes it difficult to predict an individual patient's response, in most cases, hair returns to normal as the body processes the remnants of the drug, Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These drugs work by incorporating themselves into replicating &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it takes time for them to elute from the system," Wong explained. "Probably the cells just need to build up over time and the signals [that regulate the hair cycle] just have to return and reconfigure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d19e37ab-db7d-47d9-99a7-f562216fcd55"&gt;The human body is remarkably resilient, and hair follicles damaged by cancer treatments can make a full recovery. Although it can be frustrating to wait for hair to return, experts urge patients to avoid damaging treatments like dyeing or straightening on their new growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hair typically grows a centimeter a month on the scalp, but good nutrition and blood supply will hopefully feed the soil in which those hair follicles are growing and improve its recovery," Tobin said.&lt;/p&gt;

The only difference between their diets was the proportion of processed foods they contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people in the minimally processed foods group lost twice as much weight as those in the ultra-processed foods group, suggesting that eating less processed foods can better help one maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants on a minimally processed foods diet consumed 289.9 fewer calories per day, and lost 2% of their body weight on average. According to the study authors, this could amount to as much as a 13% weight loss for men and 9% for women over a period of 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People eating ultra-processed foods reduced their daily calorie intake by less, 119.5 calories, and lost 1% of their weight over the course of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the outset, the authors of the study ran a battery of tests on all 55 participants, capturing measurements for a comprehensive suite of health metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals were divided randomly into either the minimally processed or ultra-processed foods group, and followed the corresponding diet for 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the individuals could choose what to eat, they chose from food delivered to them by the researchers that matched both the Eatwell profile and the minimally processed foods/ ultra-processed foods group to which they had been assigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food they received contained more calories than they needed, and they were instructed to eat as much as they wanted. Participants regularly responded to questionnaires on which they reported their food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished, who was not involved in the study, commented to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that “the free-living setup makes the findings more realistic but also introduces variables that are hard to control, so while the results seem compelling, they should be interpreted with caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals on the minimally processed foods diet reported greater success at resisting cravings, although they were the group that turned out to be losing the most weight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 8 weeks, a 4-week washout period took place, during which participants returned to their normal diet. This was followed by a 2-week baseline period in which the researchers performed additional health tests to observe the effects of individuals’ 8-week minimally processed foods or ultra-processed foods experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this break, participants switched sides, with the individuals in the minimally processed foods group moving to the ultra-processed foods diet and vice versa for another 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of those 2 months, the researchers once more assessed both groups’ health metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s crossover design and use of a washout period strengthened its internal reliability, and coaching likely improved adherence,” noted Routhenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However,” she said, “reliance on self-reported food diaries and the exclusion of certain dietary groups limit generalizability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the researchers found that the ultra-processed foods diet was associated with a lower &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ldl-cholesterol" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;LDL (“bad”) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; level. Ultra-processed foods are often criticized for adding unhealthy elements into a person’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routhenstein described this finding as “unusual,” saying that it “doesn’t align with most existing research.” She noted, however, that “it may reflect the specific types of ultra-processed foods consumed, such as those lower in saturated fat or fortified with cholesterol-lowering ingredients.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores the importance of considering the full dietary context rather than judging foods by broad categories alone,” Routhenstein suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the reason both groups lost weight is that they both ate sensibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Routhenstein, “a balanced, nutrient-dense diet, such as the one outlined in [United Kingdom] guidelines, helps to support weight management, metabolic function, heart health, and healthy aging by providing the essential nutrients the body needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While ultraprocessed foods are often linked to poor outcomes,” she said, “what we choose to include in our diet may matter even more than what we avoid.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, who was not involved in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we recommend to our patients, and what is the basis for most successful diets, is reducing carbohydrate and sugar intake and emphasizing protein and non-starchy vegetables in the diet. Minimizing carbohydrates and sugars helps direct the body towards burning fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultraprocessed foods,” he cautioned, “tend to have additional additives that can be detrimental, so it is better to minimize these foods as well. Therefore, having the proper nutrients and a good source are both important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also,” added Routhenstein, “important to consider the nutritional quality of individual foods, as not all [ultra-processed foods] are the same, and broad labels can miss meaningful differences in the nutritional composition, and therefore health impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While ultra-processed foods may not directly hinder weight loss, prior research has linked them to poor metabolic health, increased cardiovascular risk, higher mortality, and negative impacts on gut health,” Routhenstein told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their engineered flavors, low satiety, and high palatability can lead to overeating, and they often contain additives, preservatives, or contaminants with unknown long-term effects,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While ultra-processed foods still afforded study participants a measure of weight loss, the trial “did show a benefit of minimally processed foods over ultra-processed foods,” Ali further noted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet shakes are one type of processed food that may be of value in healthy dieting — with some caveats — said Ali. They “can be helpful for weight loss, provided they have the right ingredients.” He cited “smoothies with a lot of fruit, though not ultraprocessed.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low-sugar shakes that are high in protein can be beneficial, but not ultraprocessed [shakes, which] will not help weight loss due to sugar content,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 06:31:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNN2lTSXhreDg4VnFKYWFIcUR6Yk5OajFMNFcwd0tZTmVKMnhnQ21mbHcxWFhBN1BmbWVDQnF0WHVlQjJHVnNkZ0szZEI1ZE9RR2p3WGVfZTYxczlDUmcxNG56d0xCSGtvS2xLbzdnYTVOZWl1bHF3Z09ZSndWZ1hhNjFtT1FiR1pyM0pYZ3JyX0FNWFVNY3pWVW1GOFF5aUg0ZUEw</guid></item><item><title>糖尿病和铬：科学表明，这种微量矿物质可能是抗高血糖的秘密武器； -印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine falling prey to a chronic disease where the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to high blood sugar levels. Now, insulin, a hormone, is crucial for allowing glucose (sugar) to enter cells for energy. When this process is disrupted, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, potentially causing damage to various organs over time. That’s when diabetes hits you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, global estimates suggest that around 570.9 million adults will be living with diabetes. This represents roughly 1 in 10 adults globally. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) projects that this number will continue to rise, with 853 million people estimated to have diabetes by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily, there are two types of diabetes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The body's cells become resistant to insulin, or the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin, or both. It often develops in adulthood, but increasingly, it's being diagnosed in younger individuals due to rising obesity rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for diabetes. While advancements in medical science have made it possible to manage diabetes effectively, there’s yet to be a medicine that can cure this chronic disease. Now, managing diabetes doesn't just come down to medication; it often includes watching your diet, lifestyle, and sometimes tiny but powerful nutrients. One such nutrient that’s been sparking interest in the diabetes community is a trace mineral found in foods and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say hello to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;chromium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a trace mineral quietly involved in helping insulin do its job, guiding sugar into our cells. Though it’s often sold as a supplement for diabetes, the scientific evidence is mixed. Let’s dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is chromium?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in the body's metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, particularly concerning insulin action. It's needed in small amounts and obtained through diet or supplements. While it's a metal, it's not found in its metallic form in the body but rather as trivalent chromium ions (Cr3+).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What chromium does in the body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromium (specifically chromium III) is believed to enhance insulin’s ability to move glucose from the bloodstream into your cells. A key player in this process is a protein called chromodulin, also known as a low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance, which helps boost insulin receptor activity and improve glucose processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic and animal studies point to chromium’s role in improving insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/chromium" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A 1997 human trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in China found that daily chromium picolinate of 1,000 µg led to a 15-19% drop in fasting blood sugar and lower HbA1c levels over four months. Meta-analyses of clinical trials (doses ranging from 50-1,000 µg/day for 4-25 weeks) found overall improvements in fasting glucose, insulin, and HbA1c levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15208835/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The mineral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is also linked to modest reductions in LDL cholesterol and insulin resistance, especially in overweight individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, all is *not* bright and sunny regarding the research on chromium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some well-designed studies showed no improvement in blood sugar control despite increasing chromium levels in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-9358/full/v5/i2/160.htm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Reviews and randomized trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have found no consistent benefit, especially under real-world conditions and over longer terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about practical insights?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromium supplements are sometimes used for diabetes, particularly type 2, with the idea that they may improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. Chromium picolinate is the most studied form in supplementation, typically using daily doses between 200-1,000 µg. These amounts are considered safe for most, but high doses can cause side effects like stomach upset, headaches, or more severe risks in kidney or liver conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA allows a qualified health claim for chromium picolinate, acknowledging a potential link to reduced insulin resistance risk, but emphasizes the uncertainty of this relationship. The claim specifically states, "One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance... but that claim is highly uncertain," according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/chromium/HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This qualified claim reflects the FDA's assessment that while some evidence exists, it doesn't meet the "significant scientific agreement" threshold for a stronger health claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts caution that supplementing with chromium without a proven deficiency may not help and could even interfere with diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, chromium might offer modest benefits for improving insulin resistance and blood sugar control, as shown in some early trials and meta-analyses. However, scientific evidence to date remains mixed, and hence the verdict isn’t definite, as many studies fail to show clear, clinically meaningful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, chromium deficiency is rare, and its essential role in healthy people remains unproven. Given these uncertainties, healthcare experts emphasize prioritizing proven approaches, such as lifestyle adjustments and medications, over reflexively taking chromium supplements unless advised by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered professional medical advice.

&lt;p id="4bde13ac-cf96-4970-9831-e66b4f8f297b"&gt;Developing a balanced workout routine that targets your whole body can be difficult. If you're looking for a way to simplify your workouts, you could try spitting them into pull and push sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common workout split, particularly for upper-body weight training workouts. But Pilates instructor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Gemma Folkard&lt;/a&gt; says it's also something you can apply to lower-body workouts, even if you're training without weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="4bde13ac-cf96-4970-9831-e66b4f8f297b-2"&gt;"Push movements include push-ups, squats and shoulder presses," Folkard explains. "They train muscles that extend or straighten joints, like the chest, triceps, quadriceps, and shoulders. These are usually pushing away from the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pull movements include pull-ups, rows and deadlifts. They train muscles that flex or bend joints, like the back, biceps, hamstrings, and rear deltoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-are-lower-body-pull-exercises-beneficial" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-are-lower-body-pull-exercises-beneficial"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why are lower-body 'pull' exercises beneficial?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="e680bd4c-1547-4d3f-bef8-e31ba7e66996"&gt;Lower-body push movements, like squats and lunges, are workout staples, but there are plenty of benefits to incorporating pull exercises into your leg day routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lower body pull exercises benefit the posterior chain," says Folkard. This includes muscles along the back of your body like the hamstrings, glutes and lower-back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also strengthen the hip flexors, which a lot of people experience weakness in due to excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3WsiqQPYNd5KdMTiA24zH7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3WsiqQPYNd5KdMTiA24zH7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know stretching these muscles is helpful, but often ‘tight hip flexors’ can also mean weak, or at least less flexible and dynamic," Folkard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In short, they are underused and therefore other muscles, specifically around the spine will over-act to compensate," she says. "This is often where back pain creeps in, via postural inefficiencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower-body 'pull' exercises could also help with knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anterior pull exercises will also benefit the quadriceps, which are essential for knee stability and basic functions like walking, running and more explosive movements such as jumping and kicking," Folkard says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a-three-move-lower-body-pilates-pull-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-a-three-move-lower-body-pilates-pull-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A three-move lower-body Pilates pull workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="ec4ab726-361c-4ade-ae62-f98d1a0130a8"&gt;Folkard has shared a Pilates-inspired lower-body pull workout that you can try at home, inspired by her post above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need is a resistance band but Folkard says these exercises can also be effective with just your bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-supine-leg-pulls" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-supine-leg-pulls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supine leg pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f548dfd-0047-4a0c-a49b-c306218e1446"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;: 5-6 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="bf59f20b-dc5e-489f-b97f-5ed651471668"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back, with your hands by your sides and palms down, and loop the band around your feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a neutral pelvis, draw the legs to table top, so that the knees are directly above the hips and held at a 90° angle, with shins parallel to the floor. Flex the feet and press out slightly into the band to find some tension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend one leg away as the other knee pulls in. Focus on the pulling in action as you switch legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="51436b29-ba9c-40f1-b8f4-1a10491a8d38"&gt;If you want to make this move more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="ebd517e4-3541-4240-b4f6-dd084ac4d201"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the hands behind the head and lift the chest whilst continuing the movement, as demonstrated in the video above. This recruits more muscle groups and creates a fully integrated exercise for the whole body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-shoulder-bridge-leg-pulls" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shoulder-bridge-leg-pulls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shoulder bridge leg pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="yA-EphtGPXs"&gt;

You can practice with just the bar first, if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step underneath the barbell and position yourself so that the barbell is on your upper back, ensuring it’s not resting on your neck. Grasp the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width and engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a step backward to position yourself and set your feet wider than shoulder-width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward. Make sure your knees stay facing forward or outward, never letting them collapse inward. Keep your chest up, maintain a neutral spine, and look forward or slightly down (never up).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower down into the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees simultaneously, as if sitting in a chair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor, then drive through your heels and midfoot to stand back up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="b0533233-812d-4a75-a93a-4fb291d5aaa5"&gt;If you don’t have access to a gym, you can do a dumbbell squat instead.

&lt;p id="ae5b72e1-13e2-461b-b29b-c145d066f688"&gt;Longevity is a topic we cover a lot at &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;, but longevity shouldn’t just focus on adding more years to your lifespan, it should be about living a healthy life in the best condition possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no guarantee you can ensure your body is truly future-proof—accidents, illnesses and poor fortune can befall anyone at any age—there are some things you can do to invest in the health of your future self based around movement, nutrition and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ae5b72e1-13e2-461b-b29b-c145d066f688-2"&gt;Focusing purely on the movement side of longevity, I decided to speak to Dr Mohammed Enayat, a practicing medical doctor and the founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hum2n.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hum2n.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;HUM2N&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneering longevity clinic based in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enayat shared some advice for longevity with &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;, explaining some of the reasons why our bodies degrade as we age, and how we can slow that process down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-the-body-slows-down-with-age" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-the-body-slows-down-with-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the body slows down with age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="066007a3-cdf2-4916-ab2c-6e2310b02599"&gt;First, he explained sarcopenia—the loss of muscle mass as we age—to me in terms of the number of burpees you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In your 20s, you might be able to do 10 burpees to maintain a certain muscle size, volume and function. Then, when you’re 50, you would probably need to do 20 burpees for the same response,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He listed how the body also slows down in other ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wgaXtepaXwCtKmYLPrjkf4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wgaXtepaXwCtKmYLPrjkf4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul id="59573746-786a-45db-9229-656e89a82d4c"&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We stop producing as many stem cells from our bone marrow as we age and the stem cells are the precursors for tissue growth, so our ability to grow new tissue decreases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The amount of our blood supply: our cardiovascular systems become less efficient over time due to cholesterol buildup in the vessels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our assimilation of protein through our digestive tract means that we don't seem to absorb as much protein due to the degradation of the small intestinal wall. So our absorption across the small intestine into our bloodstream of those protein-building blocks means that we're not getting as much into our blood in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The other problem is that in reality we use our muscles less as we get older, we’re much more active in our teens and 20s than in our 40s and 50s, so they atrophy.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-slow-the-aging-process" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-slow-the-aging-process"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to slow the aging process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="8633b453-1e3d-40c4-95ce-1568f8840083"&gt;But it’s not all doom and gloom, here are his top three movement tips for mitigating all of the above to increase your chances of living a long and healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-strength-training" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

It’s difficult to recover from, and even if someone is active beforehand, it can speed up their decline into immobility, disability and eventually death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your risk of this sort of fracture by building and maintaining the hip-protecting muscles mentioned above. “It’s important to start as early as possible to preserve and strengthen those muscles and work against the natural sarcopenia,” says Enayat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home"&gt;beginner strength training routine for home&lt;/a&gt; is one way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-aerobic-exercise" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-aerobic-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

For some, it might be a light jog, for some it might be a sprint,” says Enayat. Ideally, you want to be in zones two to three for 45 minutes, twice a week, as a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then in zone four, you want to be getting your heart rate up in shorter spells,” he adds. “That might be things like Tabata or HIIT training that you might want to do once or twice a week as well, for a minimum of five minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-stretching-and-breathwork" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-stretching-and-breathwork"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 02:23:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNNzRmTDRzYlk1b1ZuM3Y0cDk3a2Y4d1p2M3YwZXNiTWhERE1Dcmg1ZlpiTWxvRDdpWC1rNFZVLXJIMUd2TzNjRURBMWZYdXVRN1FqbGlCY1oyWDIwcVFIQkF3dG9KU2hKYTZHdWdLUFNJWGNRTjZZZmVFam9pblVnMG16SjVRRVZKRFlIVUtWbGZyM0xFS21LdzFtb25Nd1BPek5NSGZnWUpVc1hjYkVYVHJsMm12UQ</guid></item><item><title>每天吃60克杏仁可以保护DNA并减少氧化应激：研究-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwJBVV95cUxPOHVhRHpkVWZBQ1N0V2hYUnJVdy1wUXNvVTBTZzBKNldlVmJ2UlhfNEFPSER3ckhzMThPd0o0NVVtbmsyNDBId2IzbnBxNUZfd0tPQzFCNFltNjlmcm1KNlgxRTNlMXBienBxUUwzYWlScHV4ek5KS1VuYzNkdDh4V2lvZDh6dDYzOHktclhpSnQzT0N6UFZCTkh4OEtlUzg5ZUpPNVQzM3lmMEFtY1ZISGY2SE9Vc2lTdlZTWHlTTG82VmZ5R2xoT3NuUi1ZdXh5TmF0MV9wbURUMU0tdzJfTExQYUFidnh4LTFORXA5ekE3aEhRSXYxWkdEQmZxajZQQ1VlMUVGdWs2VUNMcU80?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think almonds are just a crunchy way to kill hunger? Think again. New research reveals that eating over 60 grams of almonds daily can do much more, like protecting your DNA and reducing oxidative stress, one of the silent culprits behind aging, inflammation, and chronic disease. Oxidative stress occurs when harmful molecules called free radicals build up in the body, damaging cells and accelerating the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds, packed with vitamin E, healthy fats, and antioxidants, act like tiny bodyguards, helping fight off this damage and supporting your body at a cellular level. This means your almond habit isn’t just healthy, it’s a smart move for long-term wellness. It supports your immune system, helps protect your genetic material, and may even slow down signs of aging. Next time you're craving a snack, grab a handful of almonds. They're crunchy, satisfying, and now scientifically backed as a powerhouse for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What is the healthiest way to have almonds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Almonds and DNA protection: What the research reveals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings show that people who consume over 60 grams of almonds per day experience measurable improvements in their antioxidant status. This boost helps reduce biomarkers of oxidative stress, which directly translates into better DNA protection and healthier cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, almonds seem to strengthen the body’s defence system against harmful free radicals that accelerate ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this builds on earlier clinical evidence. A landmark randomized controlled trial published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/137.12.2717" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, tested 84 g of almonds daily in young male smokers. Results showed a significant reduction in oxidative DNA damage (≈28%), lipid peroxidation (≈34%), and DNA strand breaks (≈23%), alongside improved antioxidant enzyme activity. This original study laid the foundation for current recommendations linking almond intake with DNA protection, proving that almonds can work even under high-stress conditions like smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why 60 g of almonds daily matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While almonds have long been praised for heart and brain health, this research highlights a new benchmark. The “60 g” intake is more than a casual handful, it’s roughly two full servings, or about 40–45 whole almonds. At this level, the bioactive compounds in almonds, including vitamin E, flavonoids, and polyphenols, appear to reach a protective threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These nutrients work together to reduce cell damage, prevent lipid peroxidation (damage to fats in the body), and maintain overall cellular health. Going below this intake still provides benefits, but the stronger antioxidant effect seems to be triggered when the amount crosses the 60 g daily mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Almonds as a natural antioxidant powerhouse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds aren’t just about healthy fats and protein, they’re packed with antioxidants that target oxidative stress. Vitamin E in particular is known to protect cell membranes and DNA from free radical damage, while flavonoids help reduce inflammation and improve blood vessel function. Together, they play a crucial role in slowing down processes associated with aging and diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. By consistently including almonds in your diet, you’re not just boosting your energy but also adding a powerful shield against cellular wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical ways to add 60 g of almonds daily&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating 60 g of almonds into your routine is easier than it sounds.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles County recorded the highest COVID levels in its wastewater since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike, thanks to the new highly contagious “Stratus” variant, comes as students across California return to the classroom, now without a CDC recommendation that they receive updated COVID shots. That change in policy, pushed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been criticized by many public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, mutates often, learning to better transmit itself from person to person and evade immunity created by vaccinations and previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stratus variant, first detected in Asia in January, reached the U.S. in March and became the predominant strain by the end of June. It now accounts for two-thirds of virus variants detected in wastewater in the U.S., &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nationwide COVID positivity rate hit 9% in early August, surpassing the January post-holiday surge, but still below last August’s spike to 18%. Weekly deaths, a metric that lags behind positivity rates, has so far remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFK Jr. announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the CDC had removed the COVID vaccine from its recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secretary argued it was the right move to reverse the Biden administration’s policy, which in 2024, “urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement promptly &lt;a class="link" href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spurred a lawsuit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from a group of leading medical organizations — including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Public Health Assn. — which argued the “baseless and uninformed” decision violated federal law by failing to ground the policy on the recommendation of the scientific committee that looks at immunization practices in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has been &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/covid-19.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;routinely recommending&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; updated COVID vaccinations alongside the typical yearly flu vaccination schedule. In its &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7337e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;update for the fall 2024-spring 2025 season&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it noted that in the previous year, a COVID booster decreased the risk of hospitalization by 44% and death by 23%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel argued the benefit outweighed isolated cases of heart conditions and allergic reactions associated with the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel also acknowledged that booster effectiveness decreases as new COVID strains — for which the boosters were not designed — emerge. Nevertheless, it still felt that most Americans should get booster shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only about 23% of adults and 13% of children received the 2024-25 COVID booster — even with the vaccine recommendation still in place. That’s compared to roughly half of adults and children who received the updated flu shot in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 00:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNT210V2NtNktoYWd1UHBwelRVR21KbV9NSVZKejBYbW5iYkpUbi1HZVJUblJSS1hUZkZ0Q2hvbXpFb0MxWjJCbG5hZTJONFJXcGl0OTk2WjA0SEhhQVhMWWxqRWxTdkZ4dW1VQzg3cXJ1SzZnbC1GblctaXdPeHhwelhpY21PTV9PNE1ZRm9TU3FranhQOC05elNxNG1wT3JkbjExandwbHY</guid></item><item><title>无知就是幸福： 65个人分享了他们现在后悔学习的最奇怪的事实-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBjU0RRVWotYi03bHo3VVRrOXVmNzFDZVoyNDdURFlXUWtIRmdjbDVFQVpoaUM3TFVEU1Y5YTVwQkV6UmdaTzdvYVBfcndUUXA2b2xRel9lY1VDaTFOUTlWQW1KOHBKQjNkb3U1VllZclc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p data-block-id="0800ae83-fba0-4076-bbb0-655bd0904b72" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;We all live in the same world, on the same planet, yet there are so many things some of us don't know or don't think about on a daily basis.

They collect intimate data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what you eat and when.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what time you go to work, the route you take home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what you like to watch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know your heart rate, your blood pressure, how fast you walk, how far, and where.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know your favorite shows. They know how you like your coffee and your toast and what temperature you like your home to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know when you're most likely to run your dishwasher, and how often you fill it for a full wash or run a quick rinse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know who your friends are. They know who your family is. They know if you prefer texting over calling. They know when you visit these people, and when and where. They know your shared interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of this is isolated information. This is all contained in a profile that is essentially a digital copy of you. That digital copy is highly valuable currency they use to sell to advertisers. Currency that you agree to giving them through devices you paid a lot of money for (how many hours of work would that have cost you? How many days or months?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And they use this to influence you like to spend your money in a way you believe to be spontaneous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This sounds like a conspiracy. But it's a very real industry with carefully engineered processes. And it's happening all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devices are always "phoning home" which is a real term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish I didn't know because no one cares about corporate surveillance. Everyone only cares about TikTok and Temu and no one gives a d**n about the fact that this technology moves so rapidly that laws have fallen so far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**ETA**: Many people missing the point, so let me clarify that being "boring" doesn't exempt you from manipulation and influence. Actually, a lack of variables in your life makes you easier to predict. What you do and what you don't do are all patterned, trackable data. This is an issue stemming from control. Think about how often you interact with an algorithm. The videos you watch, the articles you click, the images that are presented to you, etc. – if you do not have a strong variety in your reading material, if you do not travel or have new experiences, or if you are not working towards developing new skills or strengthening current ones, then your thought patterns **will** narrow down in a way that will make it easier for someone else to puppet you.

I think it better to know things.&lt;br&gt;* I once saw a documentary about a coyote kicked out of her pack. To have pups she would waylay stray pack males, but her puppies were born out of sync, and so the pack puppies were bigger and would torment them.. biting them to hear them squeak, and eventually bully them to death. That image has never left me.

It comes down to Proximity and Opportunity from multiple studies. Many people reported being happy in their relationship, and loving their partner, and they had an opportunity and took it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We try and act civilized and advanced but we really are primitive f**k monkeys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a LOT of people out there that think they wouldn’t cheat, and don’t actively make effort to do so, or put themselves in situations, but if it arose they would find themselves surprised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biological imperative to reproduce, mutual sexual attraction and chemistry, and extremely powerful things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It creates the paradox of trust. People who genuinely trust their partner fully get cheated on all the time and never know it. You can never know, and the data shows there’s a decent chance if the opportunity and proximity arises. But by asking your partner or having conversations for assurance can come across as mistrusting and offensive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never understood why some get so offended when questioned, which is different from accusing. I think there is a correlation between how upset someone gets and the likelihood they are guilty.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7fcylr/" target="_blank"&gt; TheMillenniaIFalcon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-140/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153841"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153841" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;...that you have about 10-12 seconds to put that oxygen mask on if they drop down, before losing consciousness....death soon after....&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7glnp8/" target="_blank"&gt; travelingtraveling_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-144/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153729"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153729" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is indistinguishable from an intentional suffocation in autopsies. .&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7de6qt/" target="_blank"&gt; endogenix1 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153840"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153840" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Some parts of the world are expected to get up to 170°F by the end of this century.
