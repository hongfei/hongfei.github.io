Of those, 172 are associated with the outbreak on the Arizona-Utah border, specifically in Mohave County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the last two weeks, we have seen an increase of 22 cases,” said Shane Brady, deputy state epidemiologist with the Arizona Department of Health Services. “We are at six hospitalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six percent of cases involve people under age 18. A majority of those people - 97% - are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family from measles,” Brady told The Center Square Wednesday. “One dose is about 93% effective, and two doses provides 97% protection, so it is really important to make sure that everyone stays up to date on all their vaccines, including measles, as it is the best way to protect yourself from disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a contagious virus that officials &lt;a href="https://swuhealth.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Update_-measles-in-Southwest-Utah.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; can remain airborne up to two hours after an infected person has exited a room. Symptoms are known to start seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navajo County is the only other county in Arizona where measles cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Coconino and Apache County do not have any cases, and like Navajo and Mohave County, they are also on the border with Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why other Arizona counties do not have cases, Brady said that could be due to a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do know that vaccination rates we’re talking about are childhood vaccinations,” said Brady. “For school data in terms of the 2024-2025 school year, 88.7% of kindergarteners were fully vaccinated for measles, and in Mohave County, that’s 78.4%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady added that the statewide average is lower than the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks, leading Brady to state that Arizona is “very fortunate that we have not spread outside of Mohave County” for this outbreak. That, said Brady, is why Arizona is encouraging people to make sure that they are vaccinated to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people who get vaccinated will have a breakthrough infection,” said Brady. “Typically, breakthrough infections are less severe. That is not necessarily always the case, but we know that a vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and prevent the disease in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November story for The Center Square, Nicole Witt, Arizona’s assistant director for public health preparedness, &lt;a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/arizona/article_2c90ca8c-59b2-401d-82a1-db3063f27f99.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the current outbreak is the largest Arizona has seen since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 01:32:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTm1QMmlYWXY0WjZiYmhHUnFoQ0w2QWE5UHdwRE55c09Wb1AwRnFLbUlySlpueFVXaUxFbXJPUEdwWVU3VDJ5OHFUZTAweW5kdlR1aVFCSjZMdjhRTEdhSU1HWVgyUWlZRS1rNnpramdBeGxSeURPbExMS3FERG4taA</guid></item><item><title>在俄亥俄州学校校园发现约70只死秃鹫- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/dead-vultures-ohio-school-bird-flu/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-0" data-index="0" data-path="/pittsburgh/news/dead-vultures-ohio-school-bird-flu/" class="content content-article lazyload"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After about 70 dead vultures were found at a school in Ohio, officials say preliminary results show they had bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Clermont County Public Health, the bodies of dozens of black vultures were found on the campus of St. Bernadette School in Pierce Township. Photos showed the birds all over the ground near baseball fields and a pavilion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two birds were taken to a state laboratory for testing, and the health department said preliminary results indicate the birds died from highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as bird flu. Samples have been sent to a national lab for further confirmation, officials said. Those results are expected to take 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clermont County Public Health said the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been found in wild and domestic bird populations since 2022 throughout the country, including Ohio. Transmission can increase in the spring and fall with bird migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can get bird flu, but the health department said it's very rare in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a general precaution, people should observe wildlife from a distance and avoid contact with sick or dead animals. Likewise, bird owners or people who have backyard flocks should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds," Clermont County Public Health said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/piercetownshipohio/posts/pfbid02B9EHhtj2qvKqQD47KEkvnxWB3zK8MwVWEzVW882tMQJUgR7iAbDzZ2EW3P6KWncNl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;, Pierce Township, Ohio, said the risk to residents is low, but anyone who finds dead birds near their home is asked to keep their distance and call the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. &lt;/p&gt;

He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed at any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_960/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_768/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_640/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_480/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" alt="Rabies vaccines." title="Rabies 2.JPG" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Rabies vaccines.

Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;December 10, 2025 at 5:33 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_960/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_768/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_640/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_480/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" alt="Rabies vaccines." title="Rabies 2.JPG" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Rabies vaccines.

Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;December 10, 2025 at 5:33 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

On one of the days we were here, 932 patients came through the door. That number is expected to rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Attendance levels are already around 8% higher this year than last year. And the unit faces a daily shortage of between 50 to 70 beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the Royal Infirmary around 64 beds are currently taken up by people with respiratory viruses, including flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We meet one patient who waited 106 hours for a bed on a ward.

He expects numbers to climb into January. "That is one of the many things I am concerned about at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"At this point I feel we are working at the limits of our ability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Turning minor cases away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The hospital has introduced a new system to manage the flow of patients arriving at its emergency department, as pressure grows on front-line services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Receptionists, nurses, all the way up to consultants, now sit in a bank of desks at the entrance, assessing patients as they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This speeds up triage, moving people away from the front door and ensuring those in greatest need receive urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Staff say the range of cases has become increasingly polarised. Some of the most seriously ill patients are being driven in by relatives because of long waits for ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Flu has started early this year&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the other end of the scale, people turn up with minor complaints after struggling to secure GP appointments. "Last week someone came in with a coldsore," one nurse tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Experienced staff can redirect those who do not need urgent care, helping them to book GP appointments or pointing them towards pharmacies and other services. Now one in 10 patients are sent away, although staff admit it can lead to frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Security has been tightened following one violent incident, with glass screens installed and 24‑hour guards now in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Leicester Royal Infirmary has introduced new measures each year to boost capacity and manage rising demand. Winter pressures continue to grow, while the quieter summer months have become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To reduce ambulance queues, prefabricated structures were converted into a permanent unit with 14 beds - all are full during the BBC's visit. Without them that would have been 14 ambulances queueing for hours to unload their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unlike many hospitals, Leicester's emergency unit is not totally overwhelmed by elderly patients.

The experts said the therapy, known informally as TRT, has been underutilized due to outdated concerns about risks of prostate cancer, stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/no-heart-risks-testosterone-replacement-therapy-study-finds-rcna89229" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa563f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Testosterone is still regulated as if it were a dangerous, performance-enhancing drug from the athletic doping scandals of the 1980s. And because of this outdated classification, many physicians fear prescribing it or even screening for it,” said Dr. Helen Bernie, an associate professor of urology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who was one of the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670c9a" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel was part of a series that the FDA rolled out earlier this year. In each, the agency convenes medical experts for roundtable discussions that can give clues about regulatory changes the FDA might pursue. Three months after a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, for example, the FDA announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/hormone-replacement-therapy-no-warning-label-fda-rcna243008" target="_blank"&gt;removing a black box warning from the medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-132537" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, several panelists suggested that the FDA should expand its approval of TRT drugs to include men with low testosterone levels and any related symptoms, in accordance with guidelines from the American Urological Association. So far, the FDA has only approved forms of TRT — including gels, pills, patches and injections — for men who have both low testosterone and an associated medical condition, such as a genetic disorder that prevents the testicles from producing the hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26ced" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the label restriction, one can make the argument that thousands of patients in need of testosterone therapy have been and are being deprived of it,” said Dr. John Mulhall, a panelist and urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18b9d1" class="body-graf"&gt;Testosterone therapy has soared in popularity in the last five or so years — in large part among young men who have turned to it for unapproved uses such as increasing muscle mass. The medication is widely promoted on social media for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03d78b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not that there is an increase in the prevalence of testosterone deficiency,” said Dr. Bobby Najari, a urologist at NYU Langone Health, who was not part of Wednesday’s discussion. “I think it’s an increase in the demand for a drug that can make it easier to have physiques that we see in superhero movies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6792a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some wellness clinics and “longevity centers” also offer TRT as a purported way to slow the effects of aging, though the FDA has not approved it for that purpose. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned in February&lt;/a&gt; that the safety and benefits of this use have not been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5092e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Now-Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfl6ClEz5oo" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsmax in 2023&lt;/a&gt; that he was taking testosterone replacement at the time as part of an “anti-aging protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-310c45" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, men’s testosterone levels decline about 1% per year starting in their 30s or 40s. Levels aren’t considered low until they reach a certain threshold. After that point, some men experience short-term symptoms such as fatigue, low sex drive and erectile dysfunction, as well as long-term ones like osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a0702" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel included little discussion of the drawbacks of TRT, such as an elevated risk of blood clots. TRT can also shut down sperm production, so doctors don’t recommend it to men trying to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-362c3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“If they take it long enough, and they’re rendered infertile, it may not be reversible,” said Dr. Marc Goldstein, surgeon-in-chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine, who wasn’t on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2058d" class="body-graf"&gt;Not all cases of low testosterone need to be treated with TRT, he added — some can be addressed through weight loss or an outpatient surgery to remove swollen veins in the scrotum called varicoceles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d05ce7" class="body-graf"&gt;Najari, meanwhile, said it’s important to manage expectations about how much TRT can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99f255" class="body-graf"&gt;“A small group of men don’t feel any change at all,” he said. “On the other end of that curve, a small group of men say, ‘I feel so much better. This really changed my life.’ And then the majority of men say, ‘I feel a little bit better.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc6a61" class="body-graf"&gt;The panelists on Wednesday argued that the Drug Enforcement Administration should remove its designation of testosterone as a Schedule 3 drug — the same category that the drug ketamine is in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db1e49" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Landon Trost, a panelist and the director of the Male Fertility and Peyronie’s Clinic in Orem, Utah, said that because prescriptions for Schedule 3 drugs must be carefully tracked, physicians may be hesitant to give them and some pharmacies may choose not to carry the drugs or limit their volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcdf3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Because of that, you get these pop-up T clinics and other things that will fill that gap, whereas normally the patient would be going to their primary care physician, their urologist, their endocrinologist,” Trost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8af8cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA says the broader goal of these panels is to “modernize regulatory oversight,” but some public health experts have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75" target="_blank"&gt;criticized them&lt;/a&gt; for not incorporating a diversity of viewpoints or thoroughly screening panelists for conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92cfde" class="body-graf"&gt;Some experts have also expressed concern that the format may be taking the place of a more formal review process and that panelists are picked to support changes that Kennedy favors. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that a panel on antidepressant use during pregnancy was “alarmingly unbalanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e89d3" class="body-graf"&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary pushed back against that line of criticism on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf37f" class="body-graf"&gt;“The FDA today is making it clear that we want to learn more about this topic. We don’t have preconceived ideas. We are not promoting any medical recommendation or any product,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42dd38" class="body-graf"&gt;Several panelists noted that doctors’ understanding of testosterone therapy has changed over the last several decades. Although the FDA had previously identified reports of strokes and heart attacks in patients taking the hormone, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215025" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2018 did not find those risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebabe3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In light of the trial results, the FDA in February recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-issues-class-wide-labeling-changes-testosterone-products" target="_blank"&gt;removing a warning&lt;/a&gt; about an increased risk of cardiovascular issues from testosterone products. However, the agency said the products must add a warning about increased blood pressure based on the results of other safety studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:17:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNVU1IQVFtbEFEenU0NHdGZ3ZWbUVERHAtdTJTMldMTDJlbjNtWlFrY1doZ281eVp1REFxVW1sY2dwWnRaTjdYNGFIZDBEZHhRc1NwQjhXc1pybzB6NktJQlluNGdaNTRGX1dJZjJUWFhtMkdIaS1pZUF4LVY0NEw1cElrOHBsYjQ5N1hpNk5TbFZ2SmpvblJWVXVHdGnSAVZBVV95cUxNRXE5NlRLemk0UUNDYlk4RFRUMk82aDluaXZFZGxSYjJ6S2pjaDhjUHhqNXBnQUoxSkhFVUw5alBTSnpGSWIxdU9adkphUkNvMUpxdTJqUQ</guid></item><item><title>儿童成为康涅狄格州四年多来首例麻疹病例： DPH - NBC康涅狄格州</title><link>https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/child-becomes-connecticuts-first-case-of-measles-in-more-than-four-years-dph/3673811/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content rich-text"&gt;
									
					
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut has its first case of measles in more than four years, according to the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is in an unvaccinated Fairfield County child under the age of 10, the department said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The child recently travelled internationally and began showing symptoms of measles several days later, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms included a cough, runny nose, congestion, fever, and then a rash starting at the head and spreading throughout their body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Public Health, measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles can be dangerous, especially to children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The single best way to protect your children and yourself from measles is to be vaccinated,” said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD. “One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while two doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure we continue to protect those who matter most – children and other&lt;br&gt;vulnerable people – from vaccine preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease usually begin 7-14 days after a person is exposed to an infected person. Typical cases of measles begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a sore throat. Then, three to five days later, the person will develop a red or reddish-brown rash, usually starting on their face at the hairline and then spreading down to the entire body, according to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;There have been more than 1,800 cases of measles reported nationwide in 2025 -- the most since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet despite much research, no one knows how the disease starts or how to stop it from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading risk factor for the disease in the US appears to have shifted over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(11)70072-2/fulltext"&gt;Back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, the most prominent, modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease was physical inactivity, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="81935" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-1-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-may-not-be-what-you-think"&gt;According to a 2022 cross-sectional analysis&lt;/a&gt;, however, physical inactivity is now second to obesity when it comes to developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important that we test as many approaches as possible to tackle diseases like Alzheimer's," chief scientific officer David Reynolds from Alzheimer's Research commented in a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/bacteria-behind-gum-disease-linked-to-alzheimers/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story was published in January 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h4o6q001q26p44559bot0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As multiple measles outbreaks simmer across the United States, cases are accumulating nearly as quickly as when the West Texas outbreak was at its peak this spring.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00043b6nm315297y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 84 new measles cases reported in the past week nationwide, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?lsdjfld" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; posted Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s more cases than have been reported in a single week since April, when there was an average of about 100 new cases per week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00053b6npjq9fyyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas hasn’t reported any new measles cases since state officials declared that the outbreak there was over in mid-August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00063b6nqo8z8idr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, case counts are growing quickly in South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials say&lt;/a&gt; more than 250 people are in quarantine after possible exposure and 16 are in isolation because of illness. Some of them are in quarantine for a second time because they did not acquire additional protection — through vaccination or natural immunity from an infection — since the first exposure, state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said at a briefing Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00073b6ncgfcb0rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a reminder that the maximum incubation period for measles is 21 days, so for any student or anyone to have to go through that quarantine period twice, that’s a significant amount of time,” Bell said. “Vaccination continues to be the best way to prevent the disruption that measles is causing to people’s education, to employment and other factors in people’s lives in our communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00083b6nkq6m6ghg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And new cases in the state are adding up at an accelerating pace, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00093b6ni56thchw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although there is overall good compliance with quarantine recommendations, Bell said that some factors contributing to the concerning “spike” are holiday gatherings, travel and “lower than hoped for vaccination coverage” for a highly contagious virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000a3b6nwwugglwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 111 measles cases reported in South Carolina since the outbreak started in October, according to data from the state health department, and at least 105 of those were in people﻿ who had never received a dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended in childhood and offer 97% protection against measles infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000b3b6njyqa28b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases are in the upstate region, near Greenville. The state has reported dozens of new cases since Friday, with most coming from an exposure at a church. Exposures have also occurred at schools and medical settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000c3b6n11vdxuy0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of our cases stem from exposures in known settings. But what we want people to pay attention to is that with each new case in an undervaccinated population, the number of contacts around each new case can spur more and more cases because the disease is so highly infectious,” Bell said. A “similarly rapid increase in vaccination coverage” is important to contain the spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000d3b6n9wtxenlv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases also continue to accumulate in Utah and Arizona, where an outbreak along the state line has been growing for months. Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 176 cases as of Tuesday — second only to Texa﻿s this year – while Utah has &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 115 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000e3b6nvrhlk13f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s been a record year for measles in the US. Between January and July, there had been close to 1,300 cases reported, more than in any other year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000f3b6n68tmulg8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the US has recorded more than 1,900 cases for the year, CDC data shows, and the vast majority have been among people who were unvaccinated. If the outbreaks continue into January, the US is at risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/health/measles-elimination-who-report"&gt;losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;Canada did last month&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000g3b6n7yi3f0sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 47 outbreaks in the US in 2025, nearly three times more than there were last year, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases that are related.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0hrb9800063b6s8toorxz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 200 people have been hospitalized, and three people — including two children — have died because of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

"It was kind of an afterproduct … a byproduct of quitting drinking … [that] kind of kick-started everything else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-test="tiktok-embed" alignment="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox News Digital, Gants commented on how &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;being sober&lt;/a&gt; has played a "major role" in her weight loss journey, even leading to the launch of "The Sober Scoop" podcast to help others navigate sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I quit drinking because I had a drinking problem, but I stay sober for so many reasons beyond that," she shared. "Alcohol is a class 1 carcinogen, it slows our metabolism, it affects our &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and it destroys our internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/heart-surgeon-reveals-what-eat-not-eat-optimal-cardiac-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEART SURGEON REVEALS WHAT TO EAT (AND NOT EAT) FOR OPTIMAL CARDIAC HEALTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not to freak people out, but since getting sober, I've learned so much more about the negative effects of alcohol, and I have no interest in drinking ever again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the physical outcomes, Gants credits sobriety with making her happier, kinder, more confident and more successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For India Gants, winner of Season 23 of "America’s Next Top Model" and host of the podcast "The Sober Scoop" (pictured at right), her weight loss journey led her to lose 50 pounds with what she described as "very little effort."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(India Gants/TikTok; iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're a heavy drinker, you give up everything for alcohol; but when you're sober, you give up alcohol for everything else," she said. "Everything in my life got better, and I feel like everyone deserves to meet their sober selves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gants encouraged others to seek out &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sober activities&lt;/a&gt; that bring them joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not everything about sobriety is rainbows and butterflies. It was hard to get here," she said. "Sobriety is worth the upfront investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 2: Ramping up protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second change Gants made was adding more &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protein to her diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For me personally, wrapping my head around eating more of something is so much easier than saying, ‘I'm not eating carbs, I'm not eating sugar,’" she said. "I didn't cut out anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adding more protein to your daily meals helps with muscle gain and satiety, experts confirm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I allowed myself the sweet treats, I allowed myself the bread, whatever I wanted, really, but I tried to eat more protein, and it is like a magic potion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gants noted that protein helps her stay fuller longer while building muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is so good for you, and it's such an easy thing mentally to wrap your head around," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 3: Embracing strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fitness, Gants revealed the third change she made to her routine was weightlifting, which she called the "life hack to fitness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do your Pilates, your yoga, your walking … but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; is truly life-changing," she said. "You have never seen your body as good as it can look until you've tried weightlifting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/diabetes-prevention-linked-specific-type-exercise-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIABETES PREVENTION LINKED TO SPECIFIC TYPE OF EXERCISE, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that lifting weights doesn’t require too much time — only 15 to 30 minutes, three days per week at the gym led to changes in her body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, strength is tied to longevity, so it's just good for you in general," Gants said. "Give it a try, mix in some walking. Those three things helped me lose the 50 pounds with very little effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Somewhere in the middle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Balazs, a hormone and weight loss specialist in New Jersey, reacted to Gants' weight loss routine in an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The truth is somewhere in the middle," he said. "Weightlifting together with a higher intake of protein creates more muscle mass. Additionally, muscle mass memory can come back easily when you stop drinking and live a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;healthier life&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption "actively opposes" &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by adding empty calories, halting the burning of fat, encouraging fat storage, increasing appetite and reducing inhibitions that lead to poor food choices, according to Balazs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol can also disrupt the body’s natural recovery and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which can also interrupt hormones and increase the risk of sleep apnea, he added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quitting drinking helped kick-start Gants' weight loss journey, she shared.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasting weight loss occurs through sustaining a calorie deficit, which a high-protein diet can help facilitate, Balazs noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weightlifting ensures the weight that is lost is fat and not muscle," he said. "All of this together decreases cortisol, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt; and biggest enemy of weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to balanced exercise, Dr. Sarah Towne, a family medicine physician with PlushCare, encouraged a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables for a healthy intake of vitamins, fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"You need protein, but you also need whole, plant-based foods."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need protein but not just protein; you also need whole, plant-based foods," the North Carolina-based expert told Fox News Digital. "Cutting out junk food helps curb cravings and reduces the … onset of metabolic disasters &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to sustainable weight management, whole foods and lean proteins (skinless chicken, fish, beans) are crucial," the doctor added.

Early public health consultation might help prevent donation of rabies-infected organs and tissue. PEP assessment should be considered when potential rabies exposures are identified in donors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;From 1978 to 2013, three transplant-transmitted rabies events in the United States affected nine tissue or organ recipients. Rabies is almost always fatal without timely receipt of postexposure prophylaxis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;In 2024 a Michigan resident received a left kidney transplant from an Idaho donor at an Ohio hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;He died seven days later with the rabies virus RNA was detected in saliva, nuchal skin, and brain tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The Rabies virus immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum, the CDC said.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" origination_station="WJBK" data-v-ec26887a data-v-3646484b&gt;The Idaho donor:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;When the donor was investigated, it was revealed he was injured by a skunk he was defending a kitten from, in October of 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Two days after he showed rabies symptoms in December, he was found unresponsive at home after presumed cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;He was resuscitated and hospitalized but never regained consciousness. He was declared brain dead and removed from life support on hospital day 5. Left kidney, heart, lungs, and both corneas were recovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, stored serum collected from the donor was thought to be negative for rabies virus antibody after testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;But in a multi-week laboratory investigation of the right and left kidney biopsy samples, the CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in a biopsy sample of the right kidney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;This suggests the skunk had previously come into contact with a bat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;This result is believed to be organ-derived transmission. The left kidney biopsy sample had insufficient tissue for testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" origination_station="WJBK" data-v-ec26887a data-v-3646484b&gt;The backstory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The Michigan man - whose identity has not been released, began to feel side effects from the kidney donation five weeks later with tremors, lower extremity weakness, confusion, and urinary incontinence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Seven days after symptom onset, he was hospitalized with fever, hydrophobia, dysphagia, and autonomic instability. On hospital day 2, he required invasive mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;On hospital day four, clinicians consulted the Ohio Department of Health and CDC because the recipient’s signs and symptoms were compatible with rabies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;After he died on day seven, viral characterization was consistent with the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) rabies virus variant. Michigan public health officials interviewed the kidney recipient’s family; no animal exposures were reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Interviews with the family added details not included in the organ donation questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The skunk interaction happened as the donor held a kitten on his rural property. The encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the donor sustained a shin scratch that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;A member of the donor’s household said that five weeks later, in early December, the donor was confused, had difficulty swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations, and had a stiff neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Two days later he suffered the cardiac arrest incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;After the CDC confirmed diagnosis, jurisdictional health departments and CDC conducted an investigation to determine the source of the infection and to identify other persons at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" origination_station="WJBK" data-v-ec26887a data-v-3646484b&gt;The other organ donations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Four ocular grafts were prepared from recovered corneas.

They remained asymptomatic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;A planned transplantation of the fourth corneal graft to a Missouri patient was cancelled. CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in one previously implanted corneal graft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The heart and lungs of the donor were not transplanted but were used in training procedures at a Maryland medical research facility.

Scientists on Wednesday reported that they have identified a pair of immune signals they believe drive these cases — and offered early evidence that these signals can be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers sifted through previous Covid vaccine studies and identified a pair of immune signaling molecules, or cytokines, present at higher levels in the blood of vaccine recipients with myocarditis: CXCL10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The authors found that these signals could also be triggered in the lab when immune cells were exposed to the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines, or when mice were inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that using antibodies to block CXCL10 and IFN-γ reduced signs of cardiac stress in vaccinated mice and in cardiac spheroids, three-dimensional growths of human cells meant to mimic some aspects of the heart’s structure and function. The authors also found they could block the cytokines’ effects with genistein, a compound found in soybeans and other legumes that has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35489334/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq0143" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science Translational Medicine, come as messenger RNA vaccines face scrutiny from the Trump administration and some lawmakers. That has forced researchers studying these shots to strike a tricky balancing act between reporting new insights on adverse events while making clear that the shots are safe overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to emphasize this is very, very rare. This study is purely to understand why. In those rare cases, what’s going on? People talk about it, and here we provide a mechanism,” said Joe Wu, director of Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kathyrn Edwards, a professor emerita at Vanderbilt University and a veteran vaccine researcher who was not involved in the new study, noted that the mouse findings come with caveats, as animals in the study received higher vaccine doses relative to their body size than vaccinated people. Wu acknowledged the point, adding that the research team used a higher vaccine dose to ensure that the animals would develop myocarditis. Otherwise, he estimates, it might have taken a whopping 20,000 mice to see the rare adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Billions of doses of mRNA vaccine have been administered worldwide against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in countries with large, centralized health systems, such as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00276-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47745-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50656-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Data from those countries and the U.S. allowed researchers to spot cases of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations in some recently vaccinated people. These symptoms, which were mostly mild, appear after about 7 out of every million first vaccine doses. The frequency rises to 31 cases out of every million second doses, and 60 out of every million doses among men under 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection causes myocarditis at much higher rates than immunization, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; 1,500 cases per million Covid-19 patients. Cases caused by infection also tend to be more severe than those induced by immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While researchers initially hypothesized that vaccine-induced myocarditis might be caused by an allergic response to the shots or autoimmunity,&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/05/05/myocarditis-covid-vaccines-study/"&gt; more recent research&lt;/a&gt; has pointed to inflammatory proteins. To better understand which of these signals are most important, a team led by Stanford scientists analyzed data from a pair of previous studies that collected blood from vaccinated individuals. Researchers found that CXCL10 and IFN-γ were more abundant in patients with myocarditis than in vaccinated people who didn’t develop the condition. They also saw that these cytokines ramped up within the first couple days after immunization — around the time myocarditis symptoms appear. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03791-x/figures/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that levels of these cytokines drop a few weeks after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further experiments with lab-grown immune cells suggested that CXCL10 was mainly made by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/28/miriam-merad-macrophages-immune-system-cancer/"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt;, cells that act as sentries in scouring for signs of infection and sounding the alarm. The CXCL10 they produce acts like breadcrumbs for immune cells, guiding them toward an infection site. IFN-γ, which plays a range of roles in beefing up antiviral defenses, was mainly made by T cells, which like generals shape the size and strategy of an immune response. When heart muscle cells were exposed to these cytokines in the lab, they struggled to contract rhythmically — suggesting that the immune messengers may impair the heart’s ability to supply the body with oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors then tested whether blocking these cytokines could prevent myocarditis. They gave mice two shots of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, with some of the animals also receiving antibodies that block CXCL10 and IFN-γ. Immunized animals given the antibodies had lower circulating levels of cardiac troponin, a protein that’s a telltale sign of heart damage when found in the blood. These mice also had fewer immune cells wending their way through heart tissue than animals only given the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that genistein had the same effect as using these blocking antibodies, blunting myocarditis in inoculated mice and in cells grown in the lab. The authors tested the molecule in part because they suspected sex hormones might help explain why males are more likely to experience myocarditis (genistein mimics the effects of estrogen). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eric Topol, a cardiologist and geneticist who directs Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study offers some of the best evidence yet to explain what triggers myocarditis in some vaccinated people. But he added that some questions linger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was convinced by what they presented,” said Topol, who was not part of the study. “What I’m still left with is, why? Why does the mRNA lead to these cytokine disruptions?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wu’s group is now exploring whether genistein could one day be used to prevent or treat myocarditis. The compound is sold as a dietary supplement and found in foods such as tofu, but the preparation used in the recent study was more concentrated than what you’d find at the store. Wu and colleagues are looking to see if they can tweak genistein so that more of it ends up in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work comes at a fraught time for mRNA vaccines. Some state legislatures have looked to ban mRNA vaccines, and the Trump administration has cancelled&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt; $500 million in contracts&lt;/a&gt; for research into shots based on the technology. Earlier this year, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing on, as it put it, “The Corruption of Science and Federal Health Agencies: How Health Officials Downplayed and Hid Myocarditis and Other Adverse Events Associated with the COVID-19 Vaccines.” More recently, the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine regulator&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/29/covid-vaccine-deaths-fda-memo-vinay-prasad/"&gt; claimed&lt;/a&gt; Covid-19 vaccines caused the deaths of at least 10 children, though it’s unclear if those cases involved myocarditis and experts are skeptical of the agency’s assertion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edwards worries these moves aren’t backed by sound science and could undermine public health. But she noted that there is value in studies such as this latest paper that rigorously study vaccine side effects, even rare ones.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We really shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water when the vaccines were highly effective,” she said. “If we could figure out why [myocarditis] happens, if we can mitigate it so that we could use the vaccine so that nobody gets it, that would be great as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health reported 27 new cases of measles on Tuesday, all identified since last Friday, bringing the total number of identified cases in the state this year to 114. There are currently at least 254 people in quarantine in South Carolina, though the problem isn’t just confined to one state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest figures from the CDC, which haven’t been updated in over a week and don’t include hundreds of recent cases, indicate there have been 1,828 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year as of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;December 2&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have died from measles in 2025, two kids and one adult, the first deaths from the disease in this country since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. officially eliminated measles as an endemic disease in the year 2000, thanks to the widespread vaccination programs of the 20th century. But America’s federal public health infrastructure saw a hostile takeover by anti-vaccine activists in January, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his so-called Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been 46 measles outbreaks identified in the U.S. in 2025, and 87% of confirmed cases have been associated with outbreaks, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same disease linked to a common source. If the outbreaks continue into January 2026, it will mark a year since they began in &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. will then officially lose its &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/canada-will-soon-lose-its-hard-won-measles-free-status-america-is-next-2000678788"&gt;measles-free status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The latest confirmed cases in South Carolina&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health first identified an outbreak in the state’s Upstate region on October 2, starting with eight cases, mostly concentrated in Spartanburg County. That number has grown to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-27-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-111"&gt;111 cases&lt;/a&gt; in the area, which makes up the vast majority of the 114 cases in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The public exposure sites in South Carolina have included Inman Intermediate School, where 43 students are currently in quarantine. Students at the school, which has kids in 4th-6th grade, first went into quarantine December 4 and will be able to return to class on December 15 if they don’t become ill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the new cases reported on Tuesday come from Way of Truth Church in Inman, with eight of those cases coming from household exposures to measles. One new case of measles came from “exposure in a health care setting,” according to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, though more details about that case were not released. The agency encourages those who’ve been potentially exposed to measles to notify their health care provider before coming in so that proper arrangements can be made to protect others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The age breakdown of South Carolina’s known measles cases in 2025 has included: Under 5 years old (20), 5-17 (75), 18+: 10. There have been 6 minors whose ages haven’t been disclosed to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, 105 of the measles cases identified in South Carolina have been from people who were unvaccinated. Three cases have been in people who were partially vaccinated, receiving just one dose of the recommended two-dose MMR shots. Just one person in the state’s outbreak was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;New cases in Utah and Arizona&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services has identified 115 measles cases this year, with 26 cases identified in the past three weeks, according to the agency’s &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;online dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new case was reported Monday at the Bingham Kooper Kids childcare facility, located inside Bingham High School in the city of South Jordan. The person was unvaccinated, according to local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;ABC4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s unclear where the person was initially infected and whether they were a child or an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s a long list of potential measles exposure &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; in Utah, including two elementary schools, a junior high school, a high school, two emergency rooms, a Walmart, and the Treehouse Children’s Museum in Ogden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utah’s measles cases have been concentrated in the southwest region of the state, where it shares a border with Arizona, a state that has identified 23 of its own cases in the past two weeks. Arizona has seen 176 measles cases this year, with 97% of cases in unvaccinated patients, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. Sixty-six percent of cases in Arizona have occurred in people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine nonsense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has been officially consumed by far-right activists ever since President Donald Trump took power in January. Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and he quickly worked to radically alter the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To take just some recent examples, Kennedy has claimed without evidence that peanut allergies are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-is-now-blaming-vaccines-on-peanut-allergies-despite-the-evidence-2000689593"&gt;caused by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s installed anti-vaccine activist &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-taps-preacher-who-blames-vaccines-for-cancer-compares-covid-tracking-to-nazi-germany-2000694531"&gt;Kirk Milhoan&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to remove a recommendation that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-are-doing-harm-rfk-jr-s-acip-guts-universal-hep-b-vaccination-at-birth-2000695747"&gt;from birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is grossly unqualified for the job and quite literally doesn’t believe in germ theory. And as long as he and his MAHA buddies are allowed to continue dismantling the country’s public health infrastructure, we’re going to see more cases of measles, a disease that can induce something called “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s immune amnesia? It’s when your immune system forgets how to fight the pathogens it successfully &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;fought off before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678#:~:text=Up%20to%20400%20milligrams%20%28mg,two%20%22energy%20shot%22%20drinks." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Too much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2024/08/15/14/46/New-Study-Finds-Chronic-High-Caffeine-Consumption-May-Heighten-Risk-for-Cardiovascular-Disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American College of Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shutterstock / New Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock image of the tops of energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus &lt;a href="https://people.com/common-energy-drink-ingredient-linked-to-blood-cancer-11735858" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:taurine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt; produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/energy-drinks-lead-to-man-stroke-11865885" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 18:05:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9ldnFTRmRyZmJkencwcXlSYlFfeFBnTDdFQnJlMDlhbnd1NWN6NURjUkNxYUlublJ1aTd1WjQtaFBCY254OXZWWlNMX1UyOV9sSDEyejVDN0ZFOGNoWXJDbUdfeDRQTDhTZVVTZEVyckZkZw</guid></item><item><title>我服用多动症药丸很多年了。没有人警告过这么快下班--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15367585/adhd-ritalin-antidepressants-fast-withdrawal-agony.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At seven years old, Danielle Gansky was the kid who beat to her own drum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second grader was bubbly and energetic, but her teachers were more fixated on her sloppy handwriting, slipping grades and how much she fidgeted in her seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They insisted she was showing signs of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-6d573d30-d54c-11f0-99c2-cff911e82d0e"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and recommended her parents take her to a children's psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky was immediately diagnosed with the attention disorder and an unspecified learning disability, and promptly prescribed her methylphenidate, sold under the brand name Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug - a stimulant to increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine to control attention and impulsive behavior - left her agitated and irritable, which led to further diagnoses such as anxiety, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-b2c55d30-d50f-11f0-b523-fd3feb8421d5" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and obsessive-compulsive behavior (resembling OCD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From there I was diagnosed, labeled and medicated,' Gansky, now 29, told the Daily Mail. 'I was far too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't in a crisis or asking for help, but I think the environment that I was in really only honored one narrow version of "normal", and I just didn't fit that template of how a child was supposed to behave or perform in the classroom setting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time she left her home in Philadelphia for college, Gansky was on 14 different medications every day, including stimulants Adderall and Concerta, and the antidepressant Prozac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Gansky, pictured here as a child, was just seven years old when she was prescribed Ritalin. Over the years, the cascade of medications included more than a dozen different pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was told I had a chemical imbalance and I needed to treat it, but as I got older, I knew something wasn't right,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted to see who I was underneath all these drugs, and I knew I needed to come off them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After Gansky graduated in 2019, her doctor began to taper her off the cascade of medications over a course of several weeks. But Gansky felt this wasn't enough time to allow her body to adjust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that a longer duration of antidepressant use, or at least two years, was associated with a greater likelihood of severe withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, stomach cramps, balance issues, mood swings and mania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.9.12"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested people who have been on multiple behavioral and psychiatric medications for several years need to taper off of them over a period of years, not weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It was] dangerously fast for someone who has been on these drugs long term,' Gansky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was simply harmed by coming off these drugs exactly the way my doctor told me to. And then, what followed was a severe, life-altering, full-body neurological crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured at left and right during childhood, told the Daily Mail she was a spunky, energetic child, but doctors were quick to diagnose her with ADHD and medicate her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, Gansky had stopped all of the drugs and was thrust into a 'living nightmare of physical and psychological torment' when she developed a condition called akathisia, which can occur after discontinuing antidepressants or antipsychotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The name comes from the Greek word 'akathemi,' which translates to 'inability to sit.' Patients like Gansky suffer such intense restlessness and tension that a burning sensation rips through their bodies, leading to extreme anxiety that drives many to self-harm and suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It completely changed the course of my life,' Gansky said. 'The pain was unlike anything I'd ever known or experienced or thought humanly possible, like my entire nervous system was hijacked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of akathisia is unclear, experts believe it is due to sudden shifts in neurotransmitters - like dopamine and serotonin - and disrupted pathways as the body adjusts to changes in medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dopamine is key for controlling movement. People with Parkinson's disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine-producing cells, suffer uncontrolled movements due to this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After graduating college in 2019, Gansky decided to start tapering off of her antidepressants. This sent her into extreme withdrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Akathisia is the most common movement disorder associated with psychiatric drug use and withdrawal, according to Mayo Clinic, yet there is no definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear how many people have it, but experts estimate about 15 to 35 percent of the 6 million Americans on antipsychotics may suffer from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experiencing the akathisia, Gansky was unable to eat and saw snow-like dots in her vision. She could hardly focus between bouts of rage, agitation and 'brain zaps,' and her skin seared with a 'constant sensation of acid being poured' on her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a state of internal torture to your nervous system,' she told the Daily Mail. 'It was just chaos, and I was basically bedridden and physically couldn't take care of myself because I couldn't function. It's just chemical torture. I never experienced suffering like that in my life.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail that her doctor claimed 'withdrawal doesn't exist' and is not possible because the pills 'were out of her system.' He insisted her symptoms were proof she needed to be on her medications and that she was too young to be suffering from such severe withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of depression and anxiety, including panic attacks, returned with a vengeance as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt very betrayed,' she said. 'I had to trust him to keep me safe, but his credentials automatically outweighed my lived experience. I was just completely gaslit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured here during childhood, believes a few weeks was not enough time to taper off of her antidepressants after taking them for so many years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky eventually checked herself into a hospital, but she claims doctors insisted she was exaggerating and that her symptoms were proof that she needed to be medicated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky spent about five months completely bedridden, often waking up from nightmares shaking and screaming on the floor and unable to get dressed, before checking herself into a hospital for in-patient psychiatric care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she claimed that doctors insisted she was exaggerating or just suffering from bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of desperation, Gansky decided to start taking the SSRI fluvoxamine, which is used for OCD and social anxiety, in hopes it would give her her life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of two and a half months on fluvoxamine, her body slowly began to stabilize and allow her to function once again. However, she 'never quite felt right' after initially going through withdrawal and would frequently suffer emotional breakdowns or periods of severe depression and anxiety that lasted for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky claimed that doctors insisted she just needed to go back on the medications she had so desperately tried to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she said a doctor believed her wanting to taper slowly was a sign of OCD. Another doctor, however, claimed she could go off fluvoxamine 'cold turkey' with no tapering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led Gansky to stop fluvoxamine without tapering. But in just weeks, 'I basically found myself back in that same withdrawal nightmare again,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a few months of quitting fluvoxamine, she lost 20 pounds and again felt chained to her bed. Doctors prescribed her olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, neither of which Gansky was formally diagnosed with. However, doctors suggested her behavior may have been a sign of bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken unnecessarily, medications like Zyprexa can worsen or cause akathisia. For Gansky, it was like suffering from 'a chemical lobotomy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was bedbound for another couple years, and then I was unable to drive or do basic tasks,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I lost my sense of self. I had profound cognitive impairment, memory loss. My creativity, my intelligence, my ability to feel love or joy, everything that made me, me, was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to relearn basic functions. I was getting lost in my own house. I went from being a vibrant, joyful person who loved life to feeling chronically ill and disabled. I was in my 20s grieving the loss of my own mind and life. I felt like it had been taken from me too soon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail she is 'still healing,' but is hoping her story will inspire stricter tapering guidelines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To escape from the endless loop of withdrawal, Gansky is now back on about 58mg of fluvoxamine, just over half the typical 100mg starting dose, and is working with a compounding pharmacy that can adjust her dose by a fraction of a milligram if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has, however, been able to stay off her other medications, and the fluvoxamine helps to keep her anxiety and depression at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also sits on the advisory board for the Antidepressant Coalition for Education, a nonprofit that works to raise awareness of antidepressant side effects and withdrawal. Currently, the group is working with the FDA to update tapering guidelines and add black box warnings about withdrawal risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her work has also led her to meeting FDA commissioner Dr Marty Makary and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, both of whom have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-15082071/RFK-Jr-overmedication-shooting-childhood-disease.html"&gt;openly criticized the 'overmedication' of SSRIs in minors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky now sits on the advisory board for the Antidepressant Coalition for Education, which is working with the FDA and Robert F Kennedy Jr (pictured here with Gansky) to update tapering guidelines and labels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail that while she is not against the use of antidepressants, she hopes her advocacy work and the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement pushed by RFK Jr can lead to stricter tapering guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much of that advocacy work, however, is done from Gansky's bed, as she is still weakened by the effects of such severe withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm still healing,' she said. 'For most of my life, my inner reality was dismissed or reinterpreted for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was silenced and dismissed at every turn, and I know so many others are as well. My story is just one window into a much larger public health crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;psychiatric conditions&lt;/a&gt; have common biological roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;cluster into five categories&lt;/a&gt;, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fellow travellers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03180-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_51535866.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk sharing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02210-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_23392166.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain-cell growth keeps mood disorders at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A single sperm donor who carries a rare cancer-causing genetic mutation has fathered at least 197 children across 14 countries in Europe, according to &lt;a href="https://investigations.news-exchange.ebu.ch/donor-7069-tp53-mutation-exposes-sperm-banking-crisis/"&gt;a collaborative investigation by 14 European news groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their investigative report, some of the children have already died, and many others are expected to develop deadly cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man—Donor 7069, alias “Kjeld”—carries a rare mutation in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/"&gt;TP53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gene, which codes for a critical tumor suppressor called protein 53 or p53. This protein (which is a transcription factor) keeps cells from dividing uncontrollably, can activate DNA repair processes amid damage, and can trigger cell death when a cell is beyond repair. Many cancers are linked to mutations in p53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a p53 mutation is passed down in sperm (a germline mutation), it causes a rare autosomal dominant condition called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/li-fraumeni-syndrome/#causes"&gt;Li Fraumeni syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of a variety of cancers in childhood and young adults. Those include cancers of the brain, blood, bone, soft tissue, adrenal glands, and breast, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated frequency of this type of mutation is between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 20,000 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the investigation, the man was unaffected by the condition, but the mutation was present in around 20 percent of his sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that a series of specialized computer-based training exercises can significantly reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among IDF combat soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-reviewed study by Tel Aviv University (TAU), the IDF Medical Corps, and the US Department of Defense is one of the first PTSD prevention programs in the world that was tested and replicated in randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was developed by Prof. Yair Bar-Haim, professor of psychology and neuroscience at TAU and director of the National Center for Traumatic Stress and Resilience, and doctoral student Chelsea Gober Dykan.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It found that out of more than 500 soldiers, just one percent of those who participated in the attention-training program developed PTSD, compared to 5.3% in the control group — an almost fivefold reduction in risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple program that shifts a soldier’s attention towards the threat on the screen,” Bar-Haim told The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Computerized prevention program could lower PTSD to 1% of former combat troops"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The research comes as the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-half-of-soldiers-treated-in-rehab-centers-have-mental-health-issues-stats-show/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that it has treated some 22,000 wounded soldiers since October 7, 2023, of whom some 58% are suffering from PTSD and other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar-Haim said he believes the program works because “attention to threat is a basic mechanism in human survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, people “who do not pay enough attention to threats are at risk for PTSD during deployment and after deployment,” he said. “When trauma hits them, they probably do not have enough attentional resources allocated to process the trauma.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;The training program was adopted by the IDF in 2018, but it was ended shortly before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results recently appeared in the top-tier &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.20250160"&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Threat-related attentional bias&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research began with very large-scale studies on PTSD that Bar-Haim conducted in the IDF 17 years ago with more than 1,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTSD is a mental health condition that might develop after soldiers experience terrifying attacks, explosions, or see others injured or killed. Although they’re no longer on the battlefield, they might have flashbacks, nightmares, and a constant feeling of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to measure those who ended up developing PTSD,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that increases PTSD is what’s known as threat-related attentional bias, when soldiers continue scanning for danger and perceiving threats even after the danger has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the scientists designed what Bar-Haim called a “computer intervention” to shift soldiers’ attention toward the danger to get them accustomed to threats. He said the intervention “manifests in the brain, in the neural systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3693191" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/AP25324337472553.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3693191" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/AP25324337472553-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href="https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/ybh/files/2023/04/Waldetal2016PsychologicalMedicine.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by postdoctoral fellow Ilan Wald, was conducted in 2012 and tested the computer-based training program among some 800 soldiers in one of the IDF’s infantry brigades during their basic training and through their first deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The training is very simple, delivered on laptops and computers and takes about seven minutes per session,” Bar-Haim explained. “You need to only do it four times over separate days.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3709178" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/DUAL-5.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3709178" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/DUAL-5-640x400.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Left: a screenshot of Prof. Yair Bar-Haim’s PTSD prevention program. Right: a soldier participates in the study. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, soldiers were shown both neutral and threatening pairs of words. In the second study, they were shown neutral and threatening faces. In both studies, targets then appeared near the images with arrows pointing to the left or right. The soldiers had to respond by pressing the relevant key on a keyboard as quickly as possible without compromising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 160 repetitions per training. “It was a kind of game,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process gradually trained the soldiers to direct more attention toward potential threats in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, in the summer of 2014, most of the soldiers saw combat during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months after the fighting ended in August 2014, Bar-Haim and his team found that among those who participated in the training program, just 2.6% had PTSD compared to 7.8% of the soldiers who had not had the training, considerably reducing the risk for PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though these results were promising, I was not completely convinced that it was not just by chance,” Bar-Haim said. “I felt that it needed a good replication with better control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar-Haim, along with Dykan and their research team, slightly modified the study and conducted it in 2022–2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the soldiers, one-third received the original protocol, one-third underwent a revised protocol, and the remaining third, the control group, received placebo training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tried the original version of the intervention and a new version that we were hoping would be better,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3707165" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/chelsea.BarHaim.Student-1.png"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3707165" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/chelsea.BarHaim.Student-1-300x480.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tel Aviv University PhD student Chelsea Gober Dykan. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that 2.7% of the group that received the revised attention-training protocol had PTSD compared to 5.3% in the control group. Notably, less than 1% of troops who were given the original version this time around developed PTSD symptoms by around the 18-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The original version is really the best one,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defense Ministry forecasted that by the end of 2026, its rehab centers will take in another 10,000 wounded veterans, most of whom will be suffering from PTSD or other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;The rehab department’s budget stands at NIS 8.3 billion ($2.57 billion), of which NIS 4.1 billion ($1.27 billion) is dedicated to treating those with mental health conditions, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reply to The Times of Israel, Dr. Dennis S. Charney, dean emeritus of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who has done extensive research on PTSD and was not involved in the study, wrote that Bar-Haim’s research “demonstrates that attention bias modification can have robust preventative effects in reducing the effects of combat on the development of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3707886" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/CharneyDennis_Headshot_2017.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3707886" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/CharneyDennis_Headshot_2017-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are no universally accepted methods to completely prevent PTSD, Charney said that Bar-Haim’s “practical method” can be integrated into a comprehensive resilience-building program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IDF spokesperson told The Times of Israel that over the past two years, the field of mental health in the military has “expanded following the widening of existing frameworks and the opening of significant new frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IDF established a mental resilience branch in March 2024, where “tools are developed and implemented to strengthen the resilience of service members,” the spokesperson said. At this time, however, Bar-Haim’s program is not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are very clear results now about the efficacy of this program,” Bar-Haim said. “The  IDF implemented it in the past, and they should implement it again.”&lt;/p&gt;

Written consent was signed by all participants, their parents or legal representatives for participants aged under 16 for CeDNN. Normal PBMCs were purchased from Sanquin, with a signed material transfer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of five human intestinal organoid lines were established in our laboratory and recruited to this study. Three ileum tissues (donor 12339, 4280N/HLA-DQ2.5 #1 and 4403N/HLA-DQ2.5 #2) were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI); one ileum tissue (donor N39) and one colon tissue (donor P11N) were obtained from the Diakonessen Hospital Utrecht, all with approval by the Medical Ethical Committee of the respective organizations and with informed consent of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Hubrecht Institute and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and according to the Dutch law. The study complied with all relevant guidelines and regulations regarding research involving human participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used in this study.

No specific sample size was chosen, and neither randomization nor blinding were necessary, as no comparison was made. No specific ethical guidance was required. In this study, we only collected the intestinal Peyer’s patch tissues from euthanized mice for flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescent staining, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hubrecht Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Organoid culture and M cell differentiation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Human intestinal organoid culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional cultured human intestinal organoids were mixed with BME (R&amp;amp;D Systems, 3536-005-02), seeded as ~5 µl droplets, cultured in optimized culture of human intestinal organoids (OCHIO) medium and passaged weekly through mechanical dissociation as per the method previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="He, G.-W. et al.

The differentiation process was typically achieved within 5–8 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Apical-out organoids&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To release cultured organoids from BME, ice-cold Corning Cell Recovery Solution (Sigma-Aldrich, CLS354253) was used. Following the release, M cell organoids underwent a polarity change through an overnight suspension culture in M cell medium with 3 µM CHIR99021 (Tocris, 4423). Gliadin proteins or 33-mer peptides were then added for 5 h prior to immunostaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Two-dimensional ALI culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human intestinal organoids cultured in OCHIO medium were dissociated using 1 ml TripLE (TrypLE Express Enzyme, Thermo Fisher, 12605010) at 37 °C for 6–8 min, followed by gentle pipetting (20 times) to ensure thorough dissociation. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 40-µm cell strainer and washed twice with 15 ml wash medium. The wash medium consisted of adDMEM/F12 (advanced Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/F12, Gibco, 12634028) supplemented with 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630056) and 1× Glutamax (Gibco, 35050038). Post-wash, cells were resuspended with OCHIO medium and seeded into the transwell inserts (Greiner, 662641) pre-coated with 10% BME. OCHIO medium was added to the apical (top) and basolateral (bottom) chambers, and cells were cultured for two days. After this period, unattached cells were removed, and the remaining attached cells were cultured for an additional two days until complete confluency was achieved. To induce M cell differentiation, the OCHIO medium was removed from both chambers, and M cell differentiation medium was added only to the bottom chamber to establish an ALI system.

To create Seurat objects, data were filtered with nFeature_RNA values set to more than 1,000. In total of 375 cells fit this criterion. After creating the Seurat objects, data normalization was performed based on the LogNormalize method, with the scale.factor set to 10,000. Variable features were found by the vst method. Per plate, the two datasets were then anchored together with 2,000 integration features and 50 dimensions to find integration anchors before being clustered in accordance with the standard Seurat pipeline. Dimensional reduction was performed using the UMAP method based on the top 20 principal components. Cell clustering was based on the unsupervised shared-nearest neighbour (SNN) method with the resolution set to 0.7. A total of three cell clusters were identified and annotated, based on the well-known intestinal cell-type markers. Violin plots, heat maps and individual UMAP plots for the given genes were generated by the Seurat toolkit functions VlnPlot, DoHeatmap and DimPlot, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Re-analysis of primary human intestinal scRNA-seq datasets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four published datasets were loaded into Seurat objects in R Studio for data integration and visualization.

Heemskerk, was utilized in this study. The HLA-DQ2.5-glia-α2 specific TCR sequence S16 (TCRα-P2A-TCRβ) was cloned into a plasmid containing the PiggyBac Transposon system. J76TPR cells, which lack endogenous TCRα and TCRβ chains, were transfected with the S16 TCR and transposase plasmids through electroporation. The surface expression of the S16 TCR was evaluated by flow cytometry with the staining of an APC-conjugated anti-human TCR α/β antibody (Biolegend, 306718, clone IP26). Cells expressing the S16 TCR were FACS-sorted and cultured in IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, Gibco, 12440061) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin, and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin.

A volume of 8 ml of whole blood was transferred into a CPT tube, followed by gentle inversion ten times to ensure proper mixing with the separation medium. Immediately prior to centrifugation, the tube was inverted an additional three times to homogenize the contents. Samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 15 min at a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 1,500–1,800&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. Following centrifugation, approximately 50% of the plasma layer was carefully aspirated without disturbing the underlying mononuclear cell layer, which appeared as a diffuse, cloudy interface. The entire cell layer was then collected using a disposable plastic Pasteur pipette and transferred into a sterile 15 ml conical tube. To wash the cells, 10 ml of PBS was added and the tube was gently inverted to mix. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at room temperature. During this step, a freezing medium was prepared, consisting of 80% heat FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 20% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher) and transferred into a cryovial containing 0.5 ml of freezing medium, with gentle mixing to ensure homogeneity. The cryovials were then placed in a freezing container and stored at −80 °C for controlled-rate freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Co-culture of reporter T cells with organoids and analysis of T cell activation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids cultured in M cell medium or OCHIO medium (with or without IFNγ stimulation for 48 h) for 6–7 days were washed twice with wash medium (adDMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES and 1× Glutamax) and broken into small pieces by mechanical shearing to ensure better antigen uptake. 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of 33-mer peptides or 20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of gliadin proteins were added to the organoids for 5 h prior to co-culture. J76TPR cells expressing S16 TCR or JRT3 cells expressing D2 TCR were counted and co-cultured with antigen pre-treated organoids at a 1:1 ratio. The organoid and T cell co-cultures were maintained overnight in a co-culture medium consisting of 48.75% OCHIO medium, 48.75% T cell medium, and 2.5% BME. T cell activation in J76TPR was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were stained with the APC-conjugated anti-human TCR α/β antibody. Then the eGFP fluorescence from the NFAT-RE-eGFP reporter construct in J76TPR cell line was analysed, as an indicator of T cell activation. T cell activation in JRT3 cells was assessed by measuring the luciferase activity using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E2510) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescence intensity of each well was recorded for 1,000 ms using the Spark multimode microplate reader (TECAN Life Sciences). The induction of luciferase activity was quantified by calculating the ratio of the difference between the luminescence counts per second (cps) of the target wells and the average luminescence cps of the cell-free wells to the difference between the average luminescence cps of the T cell-only wells and the average luminescence cps of the cell-free wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Co-culture of primary human T cells with M cells and analysis of T cell activation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids cultured in M cell medium or OCHIO medium (with or without IFNγ stimulation for 48 h) for 6–7 days were collected as a single-cell suspension as described above. Cells were then stained with antibodies and FACS-sorted into MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; populations for the following co-culture assays. All experiments were performed in flat bottom 96-well plates (Greiner, 655180) pre-coated overnight at 4 °C with 1% BME in PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For antigen-dependent activation of autologous T cells, 20,000 FACS-sorted MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; organoid cells were plated and incubated overnight with a human MHC-II-restricted peptide pool (JPT Peptide Technologies, PM-CEFT-MHC-II-1; 5 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

After 24 h, T cell activation was analysed by flow cytometry following staining with DAPI, anti-CD4-AF488 (Biolegend, 317420), and anti-CD69-PE (Biolegend, 310905) FACS antibodies. The setting of the CD69&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gate was based on the negative controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For antigen-independent stimulation, FACS-sorted MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells were plated (20,000 per well) and co-cultured 3 h later with 100,000 naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from unrelated healthy donors. CytoStim (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-173) was added following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h, CD69 upregulation was assessed as described above. For proliferation analysis, naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells were pre-labelled with Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor 670 (Thermo Fisher, 65-0840-85) and analysed by flow cytometry after five days, following staining with anti-CD4-AF488 antibody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess gluten-specific responses, MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MHC-II&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells of organoids derived from HLA-DQ2.5 donor were FACS-sorted and plated as described above. The 33-mer gliadin peptides (10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were added for overnight incubation.

Culture medium was pre-concentrated tenfold using Protein Concentrators (Thermo Fisher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Bulk RNA sequencing of M cell organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each M cell subpopulation, 2,000 DAPI&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; live single cells (from one biological replicate) were FACS-sorted into the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher, 15596026). Library preparation and sequencing were performed by Single Cell Discovery following the standard protocol. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome. Raw counts data was subjected to DEseq2 R package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Love, M.

The KEGG gene sets (v.7.4) and all GO gene sets (v.7.4) were used as the reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;RNA extraction and qPCR analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the manufacturer’s protocol, FACS-sorted cells were subjected to RNA isolation using a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740955.50). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using GoScript reverse transcriptase kit (Promega, A5000). cDNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 1708887) on a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). For gene expression analysis, qPCR was performed with gene-specific qPCR primers. The Ct value of each gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (as the Δ&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;), and fold change between experimental groups was calculated with the 2&lt;sup&gt;−ΔΔ&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; method.

Two-tailed Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test was used when two experimental groups were compared. One-way ANOVA was used when multiple experimental groups were compared. All &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated and all the graphs were generated using Graphpad PRISM (v.7.04). The statistical details for each experiment can be found in the figure legends.

This time, the assignment was refreshingly straightforward: Eat a protein bar every single day for a week and share what happened to my body. Simple, clear, and right up my alley as both a dietitian and a fan of food experiments. Thankfully, she let me pick the brand of bar I’d enjoy every day.

I also like the nutrients these bars contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Plus, I’m a total sucker for seasonal marketing, and their holiday-themed flavors (&lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gingerbread" data-vars-membership-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;gingerbread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/RXBAR-Whole-Protein-Pumpkin-1-83oz/dp/B0143NQVJ8" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/RXBAR-Whole-Protein-Pumpkin-1-83oz/dp/B0143NQVJ8" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pumpkin spice" data-vars-ga-product-id="f1710f57-2b10-4048-b419-25c6adaf01a2" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="6.3" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;pumpkin spice&lt;/a&gt;) were already calling my name before I even started this experiment. It felt like a win-win: I could get my festive flavor fix without spending a small fortune at the local coffee shop every afternoon, and I could finally put a dent in the stash taking up valuable shelf space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I quickly identified the perfect window for my “dose.” Like many of my clients, I often get swept up in the midday hustle. I’ll eat breakfast, dive into emails, and suddenly realize it’s 1:30 PM, time to dart out the door for carpool, and I haven’t had lunch yet. So for this week, I made it a habit to stash a bar in my bag every morning. When that dreaded mid-afternoon hunger pang hit (usually as I parked to wait for my daughter to hop into my car after school), I unwrapped a protein bar and got snacking. And that small routine turned out to be one of the best acts of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="8" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happened when I ate a protein bar every day" data-anchor-id="what-happened-when-i-ate-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What happened when I ate a protein bar every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The first thing I noticed during my experiment was how much steadier my energy felt throughout the afternoon. Because I ate the bar around 1:30 PM, I found it much easier to power through both my mom and work duties without feeling distracted or sluggish. On most days, I didn’t even feel like I needed my usual mid-afternoon cup of coffee. Go figure—fueling my body with actual calories and nutrients made a difference to my energy level and ability to focus! I suppose this is a sign for me to start practicing what I preach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What surprised me even more was that, despite the sugar content in the bar, I didn’t experience the dreaded sugar crash I sometimes get when I drink a regular soda or eat something overly sweet. The combination of protein, fiber, and natural sugars (from, in this brand’s instance, dates) seemed to work together to keep my blood sugar levels stable. It was a refreshing change from the quick spike-and-crash cycle I’ve felt with other snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;And while I can’t see the long-term results of adding more protein to my diet after just one week, as a dietitian in my mid-40s, I know it’s a smart move. As women age, maintaining muscle mass becomes increasingly important for overall health, metabolism, and strength. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806046/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806046/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protein plays a key role in supporting these areas" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Protein plays a key role in supporting these areas&lt;/a&gt;, and incorporating it into my daily routine (even in small, convenient ways like a protein bar) feels like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="12" data-lazy-id="P0-18"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happens when you eat a protein bar every day?" data-anchor-id="what-happens-when-you-eat-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What happens when you eat a protein bar every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Here are some things you may experience if you eat a protein bar every day as a part of a balanced and healthy diet: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;Aid muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Protein is essential for muscle repair and recovery, especially if you’re active. When you exercise, your muscles experience tiny tears that need to be repaired to grow stronger. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7909540/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7909540/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protein provides the amino acids your body needs to rebuild and strengthen those muscles" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Protein provides the amino acids your body needs to rebuild and strengthen those muscles&lt;/a&gt;. The egg whites in Rx Bars, for example, are a complete protein, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids your body can’t produce on its own. This makes them an excellent choice for supporting muscle recovery after a workout or even a long day of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;Support bone health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Protein plays a crucial role in maintaining bone density, especially as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.osteoporosis.foundation/health-professionals/prevention/nutrition/protein-and-other-nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.osteoporosis.foundation/health-professionals/prevention/nutrition/protein-and-other-nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="It helps" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;It helps&lt;/a&gt; form the structural matrix of bones and supports the repair of bone tissue.

Without enough protein, your immune system may struggle to function at its best, leaving you more susceptible to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;Feel more satisfied&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One of the most noticeable benefits of eating a protein bar every day is how much more satisfied you feel between meals. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11671356/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11671356/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protein and fiber work together to slow digestion" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Protein and fiber work together to slow digestion&lt;/a&gt;, keeping you full longer and reducing the likelihood of overeating or reaching for less nutritious snacks. This was especially true for me during my experiment—my mid-afternoon hunger pangs were no match for the combination of protein and fiber in the bars I ate. While I recommend eating a balanced meal rather than a bar for lunch, for certain people (a-hem, me), lunch sometimes falls to the wayside, so having a protein bar as a backup can be a practical way to stay nourished and avoid skipping meals altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="protein-bar-nutrition-rx-bar" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Here’s what you’re generally getting in one standard Rx Bar (approximate values based on a 52 g bar). &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Values can vary based on the variety chosen" data-vars-membership-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Values can vary based on the variety chosen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="24" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.0"&gt;Calories: ~210&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.1"&gt;Total Fat: 7–9 g (mostly from nuts like almonds or cashews)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.2"&gt;Total Carbohydrates: 23–24 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.3"&gt;Dietary Fiber: 5 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.4"&gt;Total Sugars: 13–15 g (primarily from dates)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.5"&gt;Added Sugars: 0 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.6"&gt;Protein: 12g (from egg whites)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The standout here is the protein-to-fiber ratio. Getting 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in a 200-calorie package is a solid nutritional investment. The sugar count might look high at first glance, but it’s crucial to note that these are natural sugars from dates, not high-fructose corn syrup or cane sugar. Dates provide quick energy along with potassium and fiber. However, even though the sugars come from a natural source and they have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402123000012" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402123000012" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lower glycemic index" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;, there is still a chance that they may impact blood sugar levels, so individuals monitoring their blood sugar should be mindful of portion sizes and timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-20"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What to look for when picking a protein bar" data-anchor-id="what-to-look-for-when-picking-a-protein-bar" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What to look for when picking a protein bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Not all protein bars are created equal.

Look for high-quality sources like whey isolate, egg whites, or pea protein. Collagen is popular but isn’t a complete protein, so it shouldn’t be your only source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;Watch added sugars:&lt;/strong&gt; Added sugar should be kept to a minimum, especially if you aren’t in need of copious amounts of energy support, aka you aren’t scaling a mountain or mountain biking for 5 hours straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;Inspect fiber content:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber is your friend for fullness. Look for at least 3 grams of fiber per bar to help with digestion and satiety. Be cautious with prebiotic fibers if you have a sensitive stomach, as they may cause bloating for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;Check for allergens:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a food allergy, always check the label to ensure the bar you are choosing wasn’t made with something that may trigger a reaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="29" data-lazy-id="P0-21"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Who shouldn’t eat a protein bar every day?" data-anchor-id="who-shouldnt-eat-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;Who shouldn’t eat a protein bar every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While protein bars can be a convenient and nutritious option, they’re not for everyone. If you’re already consuming a high-protein diet, adding a protein bar might lead to excess protein intake, which some people, like those with kidney disease, should be cautious about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you’re someone who struggles with portion control or tends to rely on packaged foods, eating a protein bar every day might displace more nutrient-dense options like fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Protein bars should supplement a balanced diet, not replace it. Finally, if you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols or prebiotic fibers, some bars may cause digestive discomfort, so it’s important to read the label carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After seven days of snacking, I can honestly say I’m a fan of the daily protein bar habit. Choosing the right one for your needs is key. Not all bars are the same, and what works for me might not work for you. If you’re unsure about what to look for, consider meeting with a dietitian to help you navigate the options and find one that aligns with your health goals, dietary preferences, and lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to increase protein intake, manage hunger, or fuel your workouts, a dietitian can help you make an informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, a protein bar can be a smart addition to your routine if you’re busy, prone to skipping meals, or need a portable safety net against the drive-thru. Yes, even though it is considered an ultra-processed food (not all ultra-processed foods are created equal.  Some can provide important nutrients and fit into an overall healthy and balanced diet). Just make sure it fits your nutrition needs and tastes good, because life’s too short for chalky snacks. And remember, balance is everything: A protein bar is a tool, not a magic bullet. Use it wisely, and it can be a helpful part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.&lt;br data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPWG9nR1F3WVFDVjNTbmI5bVRYdUlFUjNFeDg1Sm0yMVAyUF9UUnF1amgyTnYzaXh3RHlCUUJ5SXlnMVlkbWdSV2xHUFZfUk1uZkM4V29udnpLR3FpcEVFRzVCSEZ2aUFObWlhQ1J3WUJvZ0NUMHdNZkk4U2tQZVNHLVNDa0pnbHBCOWFqbkpvUWRlTXphQUhvaDdCZFRvSUpNd1FZ</guid></item><item><title>与缓慢老化相关的黑巧克力化合物- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/dark-chocolate-compound-linked-to-slower-aging/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBBQWdnSWIxMTFGWmdZRTBLZUhDSkpQdC1jMlJQYUV1MVlINEp1bUVqNTd1QkdTSWhYT2JXVHRKMERENnRvcDQ1Y2p3Y2trZWNSMXlETTZkeTdEUzMtdXFlU2dOMHhuelMwU0Z4bXNtZmo0NTFnZXZCWkxQM3k</guid></item><item><title>黑巧克力中的关键化学物质可能会减缓衰老- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-key-chemical-dark-chocolate-aging.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teens-may-have-come-up-with-new-way-to-detect-treat-lyme-disease-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; comes the story of a Georgia science team that carried the Stars and Stripes to Europe for an international science competition and finished in the top ten by using genetic engineering to develop a superior testing and treatment method for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the competition were held in the USA—where the burden of Lyme disease is debilitatingly high—maybe they would have won, but as it is, they placed highest out of 14 American high schools, and finished above 390 schools worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM), the competition was held in Paris and welcomed school teams from around the world to submit projects and innovations using synthetic biology—genetic engineering and modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were projects for eliminating household mold, for designing crops to grow on Mars, and eye-drops to treat cataracts, but Lambert High School in suburban Atlanta sought to combat a problem very close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest problems with Lyme is the lack of being able to diagnose it,” said Avani Karthik, a Lambert High senior and team captain of the project. “So a lotta’ people will go years. Like, we’ve met someone who went 15 years without a diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambert High is one of the highest achieving academic areas in the state of Georgia, and their big idea, which blew their teacher away with its ambition, was to create a reliable test for Lyme disease using CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR really is one of the biggest innovations of the 21st century, and still is a full decade after it became commonly used in medical research. Using deactivated viruses to “snip” away genes, it’s provided the base for ongoing cures and treatments for disease of various kinds, including the always-fatal &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/always-fatal-huntingtons-disease-is-successfully-treated-for-first-time/"&gt;Huntington’s&lt;/a&gt; disease, &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/type-1-diabetic-produces-his-own-insulin-after-gene-edited-cell-transplant/"&gt;type-1&lt;/a&gt; diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/infant-with-incurable-disease-is-first-to-successfully-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, &lt;/a&gt;aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/aggressive-leukemia-disappears-in-13-year-old-girl-who-was-first-to-receive-new-crispr-treatment/"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karthik and her team aimed to use CRISPR as a way to identify and isolate a protein generated by the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. In a simulated model of blood infection, the team used CRISPR to target specific DNA strands where the protein hides, then gradually remove DNA material surrounding it until the protein is exposed. At this point, a simple at-home test could detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test strip showed they could detect Lyme as early as 2 days after infection—far sooner than the 2 weeks with existing tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karthik led her team to Paris at the end of October. More than 400 teams, a third of them high schoolers, were competing in iGEM 2025, and despite not winning the grand prize, they finished in the top 10—the only American school to do so, and won a peripheral prize for best software tool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of their members put in all-nighters of coding, testing, and research to not only prepare the diagnostic tool with CRISPR, but also design a website that would present their idea—which would also be judged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS News’ Bill Whitaker, leading the 60 Minutes interview, encountered an environment tense with competitive spirit, something that Lambert biology teacher Kate Sharer saw, but questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE TEEN TRIUMPHS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="14-Year-Old Wins $25,000 for Origami That Can Hold 10,000 Times its Own Weight" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/14-year-old-wins-25000-for-origami-that-can-hold-10000-times-its-own-weight/" rel="bookmark"&gt;14-Year-Old Wins $25,000 for Origami That Can Hold 10,000 Times its Own Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like, this project in particular, I warned them, this is very high risk, high reward,” she said. “I can’t imagine any of this working, but I’m happy to help you as much as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they didn’t win the grand prize, but they came away with a superior diagnostic tool for a disease that can inflict a lifetime of suffering, and infects half a million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that, they can hold their heads higher than most.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I am a 74-year-old woman who is in better-than-average shape for my age. I only take blood pressure meds, walk for exercise, and am only slightly overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BQPMFP3CLRDRFGRKAVEIZBNZPA"&gt;I have had seven COVID vaccinations from February 2021 to September of this year. I asked my primary doctor if I should get more, and he said “no.” His reasoning is that Paxlovid cures COVID, so we don’t have to get vaccinated anymore. He, himself, is not getting any more shots. I never contracted COVID that I know of. Any thoughts? -- J.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TL2MEXVYMZHJHFBONDPTSTU6N4"&gt;ANSWER: Yes, I have a strong opinion about this, and I completely disagree with your doctor. It is fantastic that we have Paxlovid as it absolutely helps people get better faster, and it reduces the risk of severe COVID by about half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVLOCXXQVRB6FE6SSKM3STLLRI"&gt;This is most important for people who are at a higher risk of hospitalizations because people who are at a low risk, including most healthy people who are up-to-date with their vaccines, don’t benefit much from Paxlovid. Being 74 and slightly overweight and having high blood pressure puts you at higher-than-average risk for severe COVID -- but not as high as a person with lung disease or severe immune system disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RV5UZPA3VJAQVO5WBZZMT25YUY"&gt;Without vaccinations, the risk for serious, even life-threatening cases of COVID increases, and Paxlovid is not completely effective. Also, Paxlovid does not help much at preventing persistent symptoms after a COVID infection (“long COVID”). I have several patients who continue to have long COVID symptoms that are affecting their daily life, despite it being years after their initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VVGF2TH5JFBERD7VCTWPJCMQYY"&gt;Finally, it is possible that new variants of COVID will arise that are not susceptible to Paxlovid. While I have confidence that new drugs will be developed, it is far better to prevent COVID than it is to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CGV3REJKHBE4NAGN32PQZ6WH2I"&gt;COVID hasn’t gone away; it is here to stay. There will be additional “waves” of COVID infection, and during these times, it will be wise to once again bring out the surgical masks when in crowded areas, in addition to staying up-to-date with vaccines. I continue to get my COVID vaccines as soon as they are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: Your recent discussion regarding taking an antibiotic before dental procedures for cardiac issues didn’t mention my situation. I am 86 years old, and four years ago, I had my mitral valve replaced with a porcine valve. I had no history of heart disease and never saw a cardiologist before this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="S3E2ZASMXFBFTISXJYZ2MBWPUI"&gt;I have been told to take 2,000 mg of amoxicillin one hour before any dental procedure for the rest of my life. Is this an appropriate recommendation? -- P.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KOPOELPGNBH27LHLNXMMPVGHAU"&gt;ANSWER: Although antibiotics before certain medical and dental procedures are recommended much less frequently than they were years ago, there are still instances when it is appropriate. A prosthetic valve is one of these times when antibiotics are recommended. Two grams taken orally 30-60 minutes before a dental procedure is the recommended regimen for people who can take penicillin drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ADSOQHWRANF4ROQGSQT7N4KFUY"&gt;Similarly, people with an assist device or an artificial heart should take antibiotics, as well as those with some types of congenital heart disease. Heart transplant patients with an abnormal valve and people who have had a left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device (such as the WATCHMAN) within the first six months of the device placement are also included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC7SIB43TBB3NCTTBA77VY4YQU"&gt;Dental procedures such as extractions and oral surgery are riskier than routine dental cleanings. The overall risk for all invasive dental procedures is approximately 10 cases per 10,000 without antibiotics and 4.5 cases per 10,000 with antibiotics. However, good oral hygiene and prompt treatment of any dental problems are probably more important than antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVYJTHMPQNCP7MWTEN7DHGVA4A"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

More than ever, people should also make sure their health protocols and diets are not clouded by politics or ideology as doing so can help prevent worst-case-scenario outcomes like this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87697633007-getty-images-1327818236.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=349&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87697633007-getty-images-1327818236.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=698&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="A baby died.

"It's hurting physicians. It's hurting medical practice. And it's hurting the American public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The horrific Arizona tragedy and how we got here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Police found Tremaure Stanley, 25, and Janiece Brooks, 26, living in a central Phoenix home where their youngest child was discovered dead in July 2023 after Brooks called 911 because their baby was unresponsive. Three surviving siblings, ages 2, 4 and 5 at the time, were subsequently hospitalized with rickets, osteopenia, vitamin D deficiency and significant developmental delays, court records show. The couple was charged with first-degree murder and four counts of child abuse. They met with prosecutors Dec. 1 to discuss a possible plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Prosecutors said the pattern of harm traces back to an extreme version of the "alkaline diet" the couple imposed on their children, combined with a growing distrust of medical care. Court records show the couple told investigators they relied on online videos and posts that warned against vaccines, &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/12/06/trump-rfk-jr-hep-b-vaccine-guidance/87640999007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;infant medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; and even common medicines such as &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/rfk-jr-tylenol-pregnant-women-autism/87127637007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;. They also avoided taking the children to doctor visits, limiting outside contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This level of insulation has become increasingly common − and it can have serious consequences, Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and executive director of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/a&gt;, told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is the 'alkaline diet'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet in particular has become a dangerous, yet widespread, piece of misinformation. The diet is based on the disproven belief that shifting the body’s acidity levels can cure diseases or "detoxify" the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For the children in Arizona, the diet entailed eating mostly vegetables, fruit and plant-based milks − with almost no protein, fats or fortified foods crucial for overall health. Court records show the couple interpreted the children’s rapid weight loss as evidence the diet was working and removing toxins, rather than a sign of medical crisis. "We chose this diet for good health," Stanley told the court at a Dec. 1 settlement conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet has made waves in the oncology community too, offering &lt;a href="/story/life/2019/01/08/dietary-advice-can-beneficial-when-comes-cancer-diagnosis/2485895002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;false hope to those with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

The truth, however, is that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8703572316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;diets don't change the pH levels&lt;/a&gt; of blood cells or tissues and that eating more alkaline foods is not a proven preventive measure or cure for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why do people fall for dangerous health claims?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Stea, a clinical psychologist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Calgary who wrote a book about pseudoscience and misinformation in the wellness industry, told USA TODAY that extreme diets often function less like trends and more like belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Arizona case in particular comes at a time when, experts say, public confidence in scientific institutions has deeply frayed. Steier told USA TODAY this distrust has created fertile ground for misinformation to spread, especially in nutrition and wellness spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They feel out of control, and I think the pandemic really threw gasoline on that fire," she said.

He outlines six key reasons why the risk of heart attacks rises significantly during the colder months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blood vessels constrict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to Dr Agrawal, the blood vessels of the heart constrict during winters in order to adapt to the cold temperature, which naturally increases blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “Due to the low temperature during cold weather, the vessels of your heart constrict. Because of this, blood pressure naturally increases and your heart has to pump extra - it has to work harder. Because of this, the risk of a heart attack can increase.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased clotting tendency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist highlights that the blood’s natural clotting tendency increases during winter, making it thicker and more prone to clot formation - a change that significantly raises the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He states, “Furthermore, during the cold season, your blood's clotting tendency increases. The blood becomes slightly thick or viscous. This can cause problems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Viral infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Agrawal notes that winter is also the peak season for viral infections, which can weaken the body’s immune defences and simultaneously increase the blood’s tendency to clot, further elevating heart attack risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “In addition, viral infections can occur in the body during winter. When any infection creates swelling or inflammation in the body, the clotting tendency increases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reduced hydration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist highlights that people often reduce their water intake during winter, leading to thicker blood consistency, which in turn makes it harder for the heart to pump efficiently and increases cardiac strain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He points out, “People often drink less water during the cold season. Drinking less water causes dehydration in the body, and because of this, people can often have a heart attack or cardiac arrest.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reduced physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Regular movement and physical activity are among the most powerful protectors of heart health, yet during winter, many people become less active and spend longer periods cooped up indoors - a shift that can quietly elevate cardiovascular risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr Agrawal explains, “During the cold season, people also reduce physical activity. This compromises circulation, and also increases the chance of a heart attack.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;High-fat foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During winter, people often gravitate towards richer, high-fat foods and warming drinks to combat the cold - this seasonal shift can directly impact heart health. Dr Agrawal stresses, “During the cold season, people consume more high-fat food products and drinks. This also increases the body's clotting tendency.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm6pd6001w26p9bsdv8x6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical organizations and frontline health care providers are grappling with a challenge they haven’t had to face in many years: how to protect newborns against hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvzykg00073b6q8igauipw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last week, a federal advisory panel reversed its longstanding recommendation for universal vaccination at birth. Instead, the panel decided to rely on a mother’s test results for hepatitis B during pregnancy. The babies of women who test positive should still be vaccinated shortly after birth, the vaccine advisers said, and if the test is negative, parents should make a decision with their health-care provider on whether or when to vaccinate the child. Vaccinations would still be available to families who want them and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/07/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-insurance-coverage"&gt;insurance should still cover them&lt;/a&gt;, members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiysmlqq00003b6nr5gn9q1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But relying on testing recalls an approach the United States tried in the 1980s and early ’90s that still led to thousands of cases of hepatitis B among children every year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvq8rc00033b6q48iqk6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even with universal vaccination for newborns as the standard, universal testing for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/clinical-testing-guidelines.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis B during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; remained an important part of prenatal care in the United States for decades. The ACIP decision puts even more emphasis on that practice, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00073b6nih5sxgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It places a spotlight on testing,” he said. “Testing for hepatitis B virus is currently a standard part of prenatal care. It’s recommended to be tested in the first trimester or at the earliest first prenatal visit to get that answer as soon as possible. If a woman doesn’t have any prenatal care, then it’s often tested at delivery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00093b6nzcft3o3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some critics of ACIP’s decision argue that vaccinations always have been a shared decision between parents and health-care providers, and they worry that the shift could sow confusion and ultimately discourage parents from vaccinating their children altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyv5ale00053b6qr62j4d8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could mean testing carries the burden of hepatitis B prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw8xwc000h3b6qgmcukplu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing alone will not work as an approach for hepatitis B prevention, said Dr. James Campbell, a pediatrician at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases. History has shown that some women may not have access to testing or just don’t get any prenatal care. The test may be falsely negative, or mothers could become infected after they get tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw9gwb000k3b6qvvn5nduu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My worry is that more Americans will believe we no longer need to pay attention to hepatitis B in children, and we will return to the time when many babies and young children were infected every year,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000e3b6nvaiuwrb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he fears that the new ACIP recommendation could lead more parents to rely on testing alone and could dissuade them from getting their newborns the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, leaving the infant potentially vulnerable to an infection – even if they are determined to be at low risk of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000f3b6nwgsl53qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worry a little bit that this is going to send a message that it’s really not a concern and if you have your hepatitis B testing early in pregnancy and you’re not high-risk, you don’t need to do this,” said Fleischman, an associate chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale New Haven Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000g3b6n856l1yw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But even though you’re low-risk, you’re not no risk,” he said. “Even if there’s a minute risk that this could impact your baby, why wouldn’t you get this vaccine, which has for years been shown to be very safe?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000k3b6n58v8gie3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hepatitis B is a serious &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bloodborne viral infection&lt;/a&gt; that primarily attacks the liver. Many adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=For%20some%20people%2C%20hepatitis%20B,Causes" target="_blank"&gt;may clear an acute infection&lt;/a&gt; on their own, but acute infection can persist to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked with an increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000j3b6nliqlrahy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9320049/" target="_blank"&gt;first vaccines against the hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; virus were developed in the early 1980s. Around that time, ACIP recommended pre-exposure vaccination initially for people at high risk of infection, such as men who have sex with men, injection-drug users and heterosexual persons with multiple partners. Despite this recommendation, some people at high risk were still not vaccinated, and infections spread, including in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixn1trx00033b6q16gmn6zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;risk of chronic infection&lt;/a&gt; is highest among young children, with about 90% of infected infants and 30% of children infected between ages 1 to 5 estimated to remain chronically infected with hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000l3b6nmhun0u67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1988, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000036.htm" target="_blank"&gt;ACIP recommended&lt;/a&gt; that all pregnant women be screened routinely for hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000m3b6nin0igxat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A blood test is the only way to know if someone is infected, because many people with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick. They may spread the virus unknowingly, through blood or other body fluids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000n3b6n9wox9hw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But testing alone did not work as efficiently as vaccinations in preventing hepatitis B, especially in children, said pediatrician Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000o3b6n38dx1erf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Testing during pregnancy really focuses on one mode of transmission, and that’s the mother-to-baby transmission, typically around the time of birth. That testing essentially doesn’t account for those cases of exposures after birth, so those cases that may be caused by exposure from other caregivers,” Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixn3aak00053b6qa71n65ga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, hepatitis B can spread if an infected caregiver has an open cut or sore and handles a pacifier before putting it in the baby’s mouth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000p3b6nguvfbes9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The other thing is, we know that some women may fall through the cracks and not get tested, or the test may not be 100% accurate,” he said. “Some things may get missed, including making sure the testing is done or even making sure a baby is getting all the care that they need. So making sure that we get testing done is key for addressing transmission at birth, but that birth dose of vaccine gives us protection for those exposures that may come after. It really is the ultimate safety net.”

            By 1991, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;United States’ hepatitis B vaccination strategy had evolved&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP recommended broader efforts to eliminate transmission in the United States, with a focus on universal childhood vaccination at birth or shortly after, the prevention of mother-to-baby transmission of the virus, vaccinating adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, and catch-up vaccinations for susceptible children in high-risk populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000r3b6n0m8p6fh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the time, some pediatric-care providers were hesitant to accept the ACIP recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated. However, by 1996, efforts to educate providers and parents about hepatitis B and the benefits of vaccination led to broader acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000s3b6ndt3czvcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, from 1993 through 2000, the national coverage rate for hepatitis B vaccine among babies ages 19 to 35 months rose from 16% to 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000t3b6n93skyatc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Back when the vaccine was first introduced in the ’80s and the approach was to only vaccinate babies who were born to women with hepatitis B, you were still seeing these later cases of hepatitis B in infancy, childhood and adolescence, because there are these other sources of exposure,” Warren said. “And so that birth dose of hepatitis B helps protect babies right from the start.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000v3b6nndjd77z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The testing of pregnant women for hepatitis B has remained a “crucial part” of preventing infections among newborns, said Campbell, from the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious disease committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000w3b6nvsuddb7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are many tests available, but the one primarily being discussed in this context is hepatitis B surface antigen. It is a blood test that is quite accurate at detecting persons infected with the hepatitis virus,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmizza11w00093b6qm482i0y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This CDC advisory panel’s recommendations won’t become final until Jim O’Neill, the agency’s acting director, signs off. The CDC typically aligns with it advisers, but some doctors and lawmakers have urged O’Neill to reject their decision and maintain the recommendation for universal vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000y3b6nfme9x83c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the CDC’s recommendations are final, many medical organizations will probably re-examine their own individual guidelines for hepatitis B testing in pregnancy, said Fleischman, the ACOG president.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00103b6n5eocy11a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to probably have a conversation at our institution about do we want to consider additional hepatitis B surface antigen screening later in pregnancy,” he said. “It’s a conversation that’s probably happening among many obstetricians and hospitals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite potential changes to CDC’s recommendation, the American Academy of Pediatrics and ACOG still continue to recommend that all babies get hepatitis B vaccinations in the first day of life, even if their mothers tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00113b6n1070poce@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that after the strategy to vaccinate children at birth was introduced, the incidence of hepatitis B infections among infants and young children each year declined from roughly 16,000 cases in the early 1990s to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2023/hepatitis-b/table-2-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;fewer than 20&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00123b6nhfbujc29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got now this history that shows that when we introduce the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, that the cases of hepatitis B among infants dropped by 99%,” said Warren, of March of Dimes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00133b6nbmtbnpv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And we had not seen that before, even when there were risk-based recommendations,” he said. “This is a public health intervention that has been shown to be wildly successful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;London —&lt;/em&gt; Sperm from a donor who unknowingly carried a cancer-causing gene has been used to conceive nearly 200 babies across Europe, an investigation by 14 European public service broadcasters, including CBS News' partner network BBC News, has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some children conceived using the sperm have already died from cancer, and the vast majority of those who inherited the gene will develop cancer in their lifetimes, geneticists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man carrying the gene passed screening checks before he became a donor at the European Sperm Bank when he was a student in 2005. His sperm has been used by women trying to conceive for 17 years across multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer-causing mutation occurred in the donor's TP53 gene — which prevents cells in the body from turning cancerous —   before his birth, according to the investigation. It causes Li Fraumeni syndrome, which gives affected people a 90% chance of developing cancers, particularly during childhood, as well as breast cancer in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% of the donor's sperm contained the mutated TP53 gene. Any children conceived with affected sperm will have the dangerous mutation in every cell of their body.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a dreadful diagnosis," cancer geneticist Clare Turnbull told the BBC. "It's a very challenging diagnosis to land on a family. There is a lifelong burden of living with that risk. It's clearly devastating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How was the discovery made?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected donor sperm was discovered when doctors seeing children with cancers linked to sperm donation raised concerns at this year's European Society of Human Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, 23 children with the genetic mutation had been discovered, out of 67 children linked to the donor. Ten of those children with the mutation had already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom of Information requests submitted by journalists across multiple countries revealed at least 197 children were affected, though it is not known how many inherited the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More affected children could be discovered as more data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some children that have developed already two different cancers and some of them have already died at a very early age," Edwige Kasper, a cancer geneticist at France's Rouen University Hospital, told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Sperm Bank told CBS News that it does not ship to the United States due to U.S. regulations. A representative said the bank does work with with sperm banks in both Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the sperm get used by women all over Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor sperm was sold by the European Sperm Bank in Denmark to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations have their own regulations about how many times a donor's sperm can be used domestically, but there is no international law restricting how many times a donor's sperm can be used worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that some national laws were breached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Belgium, where sperm from a single donor is supposed to be used by a maximum of six families, 53 children were born to 38 different women using sperm from the donor with the genetic mutation, the investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to test it for two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s almost absurdly simple: close your eyes and roll your eyeballs slowly side to side, then up and down, then in circles, clockwise and counterclockwise. Keep the rolls slow and even until you get sleepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hack gained traction after surgeon Dr. Katelyn Tondo-Steele &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMHGyBwR5o9/?hl=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="shared it on Instagram" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMHGyBwR5o9/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;shared it on Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, claiming it worked for her 14 out of 15 times when she woke in the middle of the night. Her video racked up millions of views, with countless commenters swearing by the method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does it work, or is this just another viral placebo destined to disappoint chronic insomniacs like me? We asked experts to break it down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Trick &lt;em&gt;Might&lt;/em&gt; Help You Fall Asleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a neurological explanation for why this might work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By forcing your eyes to move back and forth in slow, smooth arcs, you’re simulating the oscillations that naturally take place during REM sleep,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicaldirectorco.com/about-medical-director-co/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kiara DeWitt" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medicaldirectorco.com/about-medical-director-co/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kiara DeWitt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a pediatric neurology nurse. “It’s a sort of subconscious messaging system to the rest of the nervous system that we should wind down rather than rev up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there’s a simpler theory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we wake in the middle of the night, the real problem isn’t just the waking. It’s the sudden, panicked thought: ‘Oh no, I’m awake. I’ll be exhausted tomorrow,’” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acespsychiatry.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="psychiatrist Ishdeep Narang." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.acespsychiatry.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;psychiatrist Ishdeep Narang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those thoughts trigger stress, keeping you alert. “This technique works by giving your mind a simple, boring, physical task to focus on. Instead of letting your thoughts spiral into anxiety about the clock, you are hijacking your own attention and forcing it to focus on the movement,” Narang said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there any research behind this? Sadly, no ―&lt;span&gt; at least not specifically on this method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is no scientific evidence to support the argument that sleep can be induced by slow eye movements behind closed lids,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://feinermanvision.com/dr-gregg-feinerman/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="ophthalmologist Dr. Gregg Feinerman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://feinermanvision.com/dr-gregg-feinerman/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ophthalmologist Dr. Gregg Feinerman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While slow rhythmic motions might be soothing by redirecting focus from anxious thoughts, “it is the brain that does the relaxation, not the eyes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While some research supports eye movements as a means to induce calm, this technique has not been studied specifically for sleep. Currently, this approach is anecdotal,” he said. Compare that to other methods: “There is substantial evidence supporting box breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and possibly Yoga Nidra.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;This social media hack could help you fall asleep faster -- but don't expect it to work miracles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what happened when people tried putting the trick to the test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost asked a few people who had trouble sleeping to share their thoughts on the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waking up 10 or more times a night has been David Gull’s reality for most of his life. So when he tried the eye-rolling hack, he was cautiously hopeful. The results surprised him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I have to say, it seems to work really well. What’s interesting is I can’t remember ‘stopping’ doing the technique, because obviously I’m falling asleep while doing it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s used it both to fall asleep initially and after waking up in the middle of the night. “I may not be able to fix waking up 10+ times per night, but certainly falling back asleep faster is a game-changer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results aren’t always that dramatic, though.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a new mom juggling a business, Morissa Schwartz will try any viral sleep hack that promises rest. “Rolling my eyes upward while keeping my eyelids closed created a mild sense of relaxation, almost like a physical cue telling my brain, ‘We’re done here,‘” she said. It didn’t knock her out instantly, but “it did shorten the ‘lying-awake-overanalyzing-my-to-do-list’ phase.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But not everyone had the same experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For some people, it didn’t just fail ― it made things worse. Erika Lavin has dealt with insomnia since third grade, managing it with medication and melatonin. Every few weeks, though, anxiety breaks through and she wakes up with a panic attack. When this happened one night, she decided to try the eye rolling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I tried doing the eye roll hack and then added in box breathing, but I could feel the eye movement making me feel more and more awake,” she said. “It felt like the eye movements were feeding into my panic rather than counteracting it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She kept at it for 10 minutes, thinking maybe she needed more time. The next night, she tried again without the panic attack. Same result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I felt like it was waking me up that night as well even though I wasn’t panicked.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Denise Murray tracked the method with her smartwatch over a two-week trial, the data showed her heart rate went up, not down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The initial feeling this gave me was more awareness of my body, like the pressure of my eyeballs; I could also hear my heartbeat,” she said. Worse, her “mind switched from sleepy to analytical, thinking of campaign spreadsheets or meetings.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By night 10, it was taking her nearly double the time to fall back asleep. She quit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After speaking with these people, I also figured it was time to test this myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first night felt weird. The rolling motions felt unnatural, and my eyes ached a bit. After several repetitions, I did drift off quicker than usual, about 15 minutes instead of my typical hour-plus. The second night brought similar results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was thrilled. Finally, a free solution! No more bankrupting myself on sleep gadgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That euphoria was short-lived. Over the next week and a half, the technique stopped working. Most nights, I’d give up, frustrated, and feel more awake. By week two, I was back on my couch at 3 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My overall take? Out of two weeks of testing, it genuinely helped maybe three times. When it worked, it shaved 30 minutes off my wake times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you're constantly fatigued and can't get to sleep, it's important to talk to a doctor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, should you try it the next time you can’t sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, it’s low-risk and free. Just keep your expectations realistic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you decide to test it out, keep a few things in mind. Keep the movements slow and gentle ― don’t force your eyes into extreme positions. If you have any existing eye conditions, such as glaucoma or retinal issues, check with your doctor first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s the critical part: “If it isn’t working after a few minutes, it’s time to try something else and/or get out of bed,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sarichaitphd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="clinical psychologist Sari Chait" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.sarichaitphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;clinical psychologist Sari Chait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who specializes in treating insomnia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why? Because lying in bed awake trains your brain to associate your bed with being awake, making future sleep harder. Clearly, I need to take her advice and move to the living room sooner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m not convinced my first two nights were anything more than a placebo. But even modest improvement matters when you’ve been an insomniac for a decade.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It works for some, fails for others, and might offer mild help for people like me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just don’t expect miracles. That only happens on TikTok.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPeEx3VUpmM2lhTGxzRUFMX1czeTVhNU4zaURWV0hVbzUyZmFZanZJYVVHOHJxTC1HMGhqVzBXWUlQTzdBTEkxSEtZT0g0aWhQV0IwWkFPVDkza1ByUjQwSDIxS2d0NFZvUEhjSmhYanhFUjViZk5KSkVTbEZjUFdmczQtY3hxOGxSZmtCTk5mbTXSAZYBQVVfeXFMTjBUNUlodVUxc0RPVnUzZGpWOW9Rd2t5Mkhrc1U3UDRRMS1qd2Y1Q01OdzVtQ29rS3JpLWRpUDVxdm4tN2dBNUxJTlcybFlCVXNsY2ZOcVdPdXVtLVUzQWozM0tCZWdrQzNsNk9WdnBkZlBYaXZJaDNXcjBMc2gyX1UyakVVeURjR2twenlwUlVIdFNNamN3</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现降低久坐健康风险的美味方法- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-discover-a-delicious-way-to-reduce-the-health-risks-of-sitting/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:32:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOQ2hOaVJNOV9JNU0za2hXaHhiSzlZNTJrZUlsdkdWUnJ0WG5ZcHJvSXlNcHBVb3JMaVVBWjFmYXhPRnc0NEVERDgyTkR4Y0NDT1RjUVZiS1JtSlBGU2xrWkVocWNqYnZUWDJmY0UxMXdGeFNnejQwbkh0cTJpMjF5TGtzOXhycTRYVEZDcGlUc3lnUTBHUVdRVW9qOEI5cXBJblE</guid></item><item><title>健身教练说，每45分钟做10次深蹲，而不是1万步，可以促进新陈代谢和燃烧脂肪|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-coach-says-doing-10-squats-every-45-minutes-instead-of-10k-steps-can-boost-metabolism-and-fatburning-101765362808682.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/fitness-coach-says-doing-10-squats-every-45-minutes-instead-of-10k-steps-can-boost-metabolism-and-fatburning-101765362808682.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercising regularly ensures that you stay fit and also influences other functions, including boosting &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/mental-health" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="mental health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, promoting better sleep, controlling weight, and more.

Here's how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10 squats instead of 10k steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In the post, captioned “10 squats instead of 10K steps,” Zarina highlighted that according to a recent study, doing ten squats every 45 minutes is equal to 10,000 steps per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She explained, “When your muscles actively contract, they produce very important compounds that influence your brain, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/surgeon-shares-simple-3-minute-metabolic-night-routine-to-balance-hormones-for-women-over-28-101765261915128.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="metabolism"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and even your fat-burning processes. Meanwhile, a simple walk does not have this effect. So, if you want to stay young, squat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp;amp; Science in April 2024, interrupting long periods of sitting with just 10 squats every 45 minutes significantly improves blood sugar control, even more than going for a single 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also found that any activity break lowered post-meal blood glucose compared with uninterrupted sitting. However, frequent short breaks (3-minute walks or squats every 45 minutes) were more effective than doing one longer 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The superior effect was linked to higher muscle activation, indicating that the intensity at which one activates their muscles—more than the total energy spent—predicts better glucose control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

						&lt;p&gt;If you’re over 50 and notice muscle loss, don’t panic. It’s a natural occurrence in this phase of life. In fact, the process is known as sarcopenia and it starts after the age of 30. We spoke with experts who recommend five daily exercises to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-rebuild-muscle-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;rebuild lost muscle&lt;/a&gt; after 50—and they’re even better than &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/8-minute-standing-routine-builds-strength-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;weight training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we enter our 50s, our physical needs change, and bodyweight exercises can help us improve balance, strength, and resilience,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thwarrior.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric North&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aka The Happiness Warrior—a wellness speaker, coach, and advocate redefining what it means to age with purpose, strength, and emotional vitality, tells us. “Bodyweight and standing exercises can be more effective for rebuilding muscle in older adults because they improve functional strength by engaging multiple muscles, including stabilizers, which compares to real-life movements better than relying on machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These training modalities also boost coordination, balance, and joint mobility—all of which are essential for preventing falls and maintaining an active, independent lifestyle.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="squats" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqvCmoLULNY?si=M6DpaAYCQBFvojxz" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squats help strengthen the legs, gluteal muscles and core,” North tells us. “They will significantly increase leg strength and help us maintain a physically independent lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By performing the movement slowly, you’re forcing your core, legs, and hips to stay engaged. “The muscles rebuild without the added knee pressure that heavier weights can cause. It also more closely mirrors the motion used to stand and sit from chairs, which helps keep everyday mobility functional and strong,” says &lt;b&gt;Denise Chakoian&lt;/b&gt;, Rhode Island certified fitness trainer and owner of&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.corefitprov.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Core Cycle&lt;/a&gt; and Fitness LaGree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips to lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descend until your thighs are parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="pushups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bt5b9x9N0KU?si=Kyn2UMTOuFzZZatt" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pushups are important for building upper-body strength, improving core stability, and supporting overall fitness by working multiple muscle groups at once. They also contribute to cardiovascular health, bone density, better posture, and balance,” North explains. “Because they are a bodyweight exercise, pushups are accessible to almost everyone and can be modified for various fitness levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in a high plank with your hands under your shoulders and your body straight from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor. Maintain a long, straight body as you lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up, straightening your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="hinge" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hinge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp33YgPZgns?si=mZ8sM_a4IBgEU5v4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, North recommends a glute bridge or Romanian deadlift to master the hinging motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an essential movement for lower back strength and helps prevent injuries and reduce downtime that might come from everyday activities,” he tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the glute bridge, by lying flat on your back with bent knees and feet hip-width apart on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arms should be at your sides with palms pressing into the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your buttocks, holding at the top for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your hips back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="planks" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Planks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ao5nY7lb088?si=Qe9MGi6DiJt1lbz5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Planks are a great exercise to strengthen the deep core muscles that stabilize the spine and help with balance,” Chakoian tells us. “A strong core is key to making walking, lifting, and everyday activities easier. Modified planks on a counter remain just as effective while reducing the pressure on the lower back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a forearm plank with your forearms on the floor—elbows under your shoulders—and body straight from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternately, assume a high plank with your hands under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid letting your hips sag or rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold your plank for 20 to 30 seconds, performing 3 rounds in total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="rowing" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnMgzq4AVKk?si=bo35QJravarVJviz" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rowing movements help with aging because they are a low-impact, full-body exercise that builds cardiovascular health, strength, and flexibility while being gentle on joints,” North explains. “Rowing strengthens major muscle groups, improves balance and coordination, can reduce the risk of falls, and may even boost cognitive function. This makes it an excellent option for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum everything up, North tells us, “These compound exercises build muscle efficiently and improve functional strength for everyday activities. Rather than being restricted to traditional weight machines, these exercises can be done with our own body weight or resistance bands and should be performed with precision and controlled movements. Most importantly, they can be done anywhere at any time!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0b4c89c1-46df-4315-808e-e041c47e11fd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A man in Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The man received a left kidney transplant in an Ohio hospital, and about five weeks later, he began experiencing tremors, weakness in his lower extremities and urinary incontinence, as well as confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0b4c89c1-46df-4315-808e-e041c47e11fd-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;About a week after these initial symptoms emerged, the man was hospitalized with additional health problems, including fever and difficulty swallowing. He also developed hydrophobia, or an irrational fear of water. Once hospitalized, he required breathing support with a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="773a33f8-78c9-40ee-8d95-4c5938fbca6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The man's doctors suspected that his signs and symptoms indicated a rabies infection, so they consulted the Ohio Department of Health and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the case. Various clinical samples from the patient were sent to the CDC for testing and ultimately came back positive for rabies RNA, the genetic material of the virus, as well as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Within a week of being hospitalized, the patient died of his infection. Once a rabies infection is established, there is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351826#treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351826#treatment" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no effective cure available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are only about &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893925000195" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893925000195" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;30 reports of people surviving symptomatic rabies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the medical literature, and doctors can't yet reliably replicate this outcome. As such, rabies is nearly always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(People who suspect they may have been exposed to rabies — for example, after being bitten by an animal — can be treated with anti-rabies antibodies or vaccines to help prevent the virus from triggering an infection in the first place. This preventative treatment is very effective.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;This man's rabies infection — the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first reported in Michigan in about 15 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was suspected to be potentially linked to his organ transplant, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7439a1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM151122&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20December%204%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM151122" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7439a1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM151122&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20December%204%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM151122" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators had ruled out direct animal exposure as the source of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rUR3kF2PAykgSsTcwuEQkL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rUR3kF2PAykgSsTcwuEQkL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about the suspected infection, the CDC and state- and local-level partners launched an investigation into possible contamination of the donor kidney. The donor had been from Idaho and the investigators got in touch with the donor's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that "in late October 2024, a skunk approached the donor as he held a kitten in an outbuilding on his rural property," the report says. "During an encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the donor sustained a shin scratch that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten. According to the family, the donor attributed the skunk’s behavior to predatory aggression toward the kitten."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five weeks after being scratched, the donor began experiencing symptoms consistent with rabies, including confusion, difficulty swallowing, hallucinations and a stiff neck, a family member said. He then fell unconscious at home and didn't wake up, though he was resuscitated and hospitalized. He was declared &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and removed from life support five days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ac052f48-bf6e-4ac9-9734-cfa673f96ec5"&gt;Notably, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic conditions, not to rabies. That said, they took various clinical samples from the patient that the CDC then retroactively tested for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biopsy from the donor's right kidney tested positive, but there wasn't a big enough sample from the left kidney to test. Nonetheless, this supported the idea that the donor kidney was likely the source of the Michigan man's rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978," the case report noted. "However, the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is low." In short, this chain of events is very unlikely, and hospitals follow extensive protocols to safeguard against transplanting infected organs into patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="ab11e4d2-3ccd-41f3-8546-9baf4bdf6b3e"&gt;

"It offers impressive amounts of key vitamins and minerals that support overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Keatley points out that one cup of watercress provides 106 percent of your daily vitamin K (which is essential for bone health and blood clotting), 17 percent of your daily &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g19444642/best-vitamin-c-serums/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g19444642/best-vitamin-c-serums/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vitamin C" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; (for immunity and skin health), and six percent of your daily vitamin A (for vision and immune function). It also contains phytochemicals, which have the "potential" to help protect yourself from various cancers, and antioxidants that support eye health, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;"This rich array of nutrients makes watercress a powerful addition to a balanced diet," Keatley says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-any-other-vegetables-come-close" data-node-id="12" class="css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Do any other vegetables come close?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Yep—Chinese cabbage and chard come in second and third, respectively, on the CDC's list of healthiest fruits and vegetables. Chinese cabbage scored 91.99, while chard nabbed 89.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But if you prefer one veggie over the other, Keatley says to just pick your fave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;"Choosing between watercress, Chinese cabbage, and chard for their health benefits is like picking which firefighter should lead the rescue—they’re all exceptional at 'putting out the flames' of nutritional deficiencies," he says. "Each of these greens ranks highly on the CDC’s list of powerhouse vegetables for good reason, packing a concentrated mix of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants into every bite."&lt;br data-node-id="15.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Chinese cabbage "delivers a robust profile of vitamins C and K" while also providing about eight percent of your daily dose of folate, which is crucial for DNA repair and cell growth, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Chard, meanwhile, is "equally remarkable, offering a rich blend of vitamins A, C, and K." A single cup of chard provides more than double your daily value of vitamin K, which reinforces bone and cardiovascular health, plus half of your vitamin A, which is vital for vision and immunity. It's also packed with antioxidants to protect against cellular damage and support eye health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;How much watercress should I have a day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You can incorporate a handful of watercress into your diet a few times a week to reap its benefits, Keatley says. "Adding about a cup to meals three to four times weekly can provide significant nutrition without adding many calories," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Keatley recommends working watercress into a spinach, apple, and walnut salad. "Its peppery bite enhances the sweetness of apples and the nutty crunch, making for a well-rounded, nutrient-packed salad," he says. "A splash of balsamic vinaigrette or a drizzle of lemon juice adds brightness to balance the flavors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="21" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More Nutrition &amp;amp; Healthy Eating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You can also add watercress as a topping to soups or sandwiches. It's also delicious as a side, Keatley says: Dress it with olive oil, a sprinkle of sea salt, and a dash of lemon juice for "a quick and elegant addition to the main meal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;However, Keatley recommends alternating watercress with chard (for magnesium), kale (for calcium), and spinach (for iron) to make sure you're getting all your nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;He also notes that watercress' high vitamin K content can interact with certain medications, especially blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-much-watercress-should-i-have-a-day" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;"Vitamin K plays a vital role in blood clotting, so consuming large amounts of watercress (or any high-vitamin K food) can affect how these medications work, potentially decreasing their effectiveness," he says. "For those on blood thinners, it’s essential to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K, rather than drastically increasing or decreasing amounts."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/f54cce49-9e9e-4a1b-a5c1-b7af8ccf5aab_1737125684.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Charlotte Walsh" title="Headshot of Charlotte Walsh" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Walsh is the associate news editor at Women’s Health, where she pitches, assigns, edits, and writes daily pieces on celebrity health and scientific studies.

These games took a lot of energy. But if I play a normal human match, my opponent would also be exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_23373484.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why thinking hard makes us feel tired&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;machine intelligence&lt;/a&gt; can keep running as long as it has a power supply, a human brain will become fatigued — and you don’t have to be a chess grandmaster to understand the feeling. Anyone can end up drained after a long day of work, at school or juggling the countless decisions of daily life. This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mental exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; can sap motivation, dull focus and erode judgement. It can raise the odds of careless mistakes. Especially when combined with sleep loss or circadian disruption, cognitive fatigue can also contribute to deadly medical errors and road traffic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was partly Kasparov’s weary comments that inspired Mathias Pessiglione, a cognitive neuroscientist and research director at the Paris Brain Institute, to study the tired brain. He wanted to know: “Why is this cognitive system prone to fatigue?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians have long struggled to define, measure and treat cognitive fatigue — relying mostly on self-reports of how tired someone says they feel. Now, however, scientists from across disciplines are enlisting innovative experimental approaches and biological markers to probe the metabolic roots and consequences of cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efforts are getting a boost in attention and funding in large part because of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, which afflicts roughly 6 in every 100 people after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, says Vikram Chib, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “The primary symptom of long COVID is fatigue,” says Chib. “I think that has opened a lot of people’s eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib and others hope that a fundamental understanding of cognitive fatigue will help the billions of people who face it from time to time, as well as the tens of millions who carry it as a more extreme and chronic companion. As well as being common in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, debilitating fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS)&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme mental exhaustion can also follow cancer treatment, head injury, stroke or exposure to certain toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatigue is a really big problem,” says Chib. “We really need to figure this out — how to study it and how to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cognitive fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of a chess match, a professional player might rely on well-rehearsed openings. “The first five, six or seven moves can be done without thinking,” says Pessiglione. But when there’s an unfamiliar position on the board, the player no longer has a ready routine. They are “required to think”, he says. The same is true for a driver who turns on to an unfamiliar street. On roads they’ve been down hundreds of times, mental autopilot can kick in. But if they take an unknown route, Pessiglione says, the demands on the brain intensify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is the term that scientists give to this effortful directing and regulating of thought. Over time, as a leading theory goes, maintaining control becomes costly for the brain, and fatigue emerges. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some think it is related to how cells cope when their energy supply is strained; others point to a build-up of toxins from neural activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But researchers tend to agree that the sensation of fatigue is protective — a warning that the brain is nearing a physiological boundary and it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Fans watch a chess game between Garry Kasparov — shown on a TV monitor — and Deep Blue." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;During chess matches in 1996 and 1997, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov grew tired, unlike his opponent, IBM’s Deep Blue computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Stan Honda/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular players across several brain regions might be involved, scientists say. Researchers have found potential links between cognitive fatigue and changing levels of metabolites such as glucose and lactate, neurochemical messengers such as glutamate and adenosine, and a protein involved in learning and memory called brain-derived neurotrophic factor&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Even amyloid-β, a protein fragment associated with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, might contribute by disrupting synapses, interfering with the clearance of glutamate or increasing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But it is uncertain what is a marker and what is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscientist Clay Holroyd at Ghent University in Belgium is among the researchers who favour the toxic-build-up theory of cognitive fatigue. This idea has been gaining traction over the past five years or so, although it’s not yet clear what the waste metabolite is. He likens the sensation of fatigue to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;: both have a role in protecting the body from accumulating damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if a person ignores the sensation at first, he says, there’s little risk of real metabolic harm in most cases. “We have an automatic fail-safe,” he says. “You can work really, really, really hard for a time, but eventually you’re going to need to go to sleep.” Although taking a break from a task can offer temporary relief, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sleep has a much more restorative role&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep, especially slow-wave deep sleep, acts as the brain’s nightly maintenance. It clears out metabolic debris and recalibrates circuits and cells so that they can best use energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seeking better measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, cognitive fatigue has been quantified either by asking a person to report their own levels of fatigue or by detecting a change in their performance on working-memory tests or other tasks. These are not great measurements, scientists say. Drops in performance can be obscured by factors such as motivation, boredom and frustration. Performance can also be offset by training, such as when a chess player automates a sequence of moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reports, meanwhile, are subjective and unreliable. “People are terrible judges of their own fatigue,” says Daniel Forger, a researcher in computational medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who is investigating new ways to assess cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03904-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51809464.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Long-COVID research just got a big funding boost: will it find new treatments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand fatigue, Pessiglione, Chib and other researchers are trying to bridge an understanding of its biochemical workings with how it affects &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The current hypothesis: cognitive fatigue arises from metabolic changes in parts of the brain that are responsible for cognitive control. And those changes, whether resulting from depleted energy stores or amassed waste, alter how brain circuits weigh the costs and benefits of exerting mental effort — nudging decisions towards easier options that are more immediately rewarding&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Pessiglione and his team simulated a workday by asking otherwise healthy participants to spend several hours on either easy or hard versions of the same cognitive tasks. In one task, participants viewed letters appearing one after another on a screen and had to decide whether each new letter matched one a certain number of letters earlier. Recalling whether the letter on screen matched the third letter back, for example, would be much more difficult than recalling whether it matched the first letter back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this simulated workday, participants made choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed ones. Those who had completed the harder tasks were more likely to opt for instant gratification. That preference was also consistent with greater accumulation of glutamate — one of the metabolites suspected to build up with cognitive exertion — in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain region is involved in executive functions, such as working memory and decision-making, and has been found to have lower activity after a hard day of simulated work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Apps, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that the dynamics of dopamine — which interacts closely with adenosine, glutamate and other metabolic players in the brain — might help to explain the connection between neurometabolic strain and the experience of fatigue. Because dopamine enhances the perceived value of rewards, it typically boosts motivation to invest effort. He proposes that sustained effort might cause dopamine levels to drop, leaving people less willing to work for the same pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these and similar lines of research are starting to reveal how levels of these molecules and measures of brain activity align with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, says Chib, is that there is “something happening with the chemistry of your brain” that changes your calculation on whether you should exert cognitive effort. He says that baseline chemistry will differ between people: “You and I might have different concentrations of neurotransmitters in our brain, and that inherent difference could make me feel very tired, whereas you’re able to persist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793258.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First proposed blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome: what scientists think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These, or similar differences in chemistry, might help to explain chronic and other extreme fatigue. In people with long COVID or ME/CFS, a small mental task can feel as intimidating as performing brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ana Lia Tamariz, an artist and health-and-wellness coach in Miami, Florida, who has ME/CFS, simply listening to music or reading a book often requires immense effort. “Sometimes, I cannot read one more word,” she says. “Imagine coming out of anaesthesia from a surgical procedure groggy. Imagine you never exit that state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her, the cognitive and physical fatigue can be hard to separate. Any cognitively demanding task can make her physically drained, she says. And anything physically demanding can leave her mentally spent. Tamariz says she is constantly doing the calculation: “Is this worth my energy?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports the idea that some shared mechanisms might drive both physical and cognitive fatigue, and that the two interact&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “If you run a marathon, yes, there is physical fatigue in your body,” says Apps. “But by God, you’re going to feel all kinds of cognitive fatigue as well from the strain and the concentration that’s required to maintain your performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverse also seems to be true. In a preprint from last year, Chib’s team found that otherwise healthy participants were less willing to exert physical effort after performing a mentally taxing task&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers are studying the roles of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, circadian rhythms and inflammation in cognitive fatigue, as well as the consequences. When the brain doesn’t get restorative sleep, small clusters of neurons can go briefly offline. These local sleep-like episodes can cause momentary lapses in attention and other slips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A trio of newly published papers &lt;em&gt;in The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; highlights growing global evidence connecting ultra-processed foods (UPFs) with poorer diet quality and multiple adverse health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The researchers show that UPFs are rapidly displacing traditional diets worldwide, accounting for up to 60% of daily energy intake in the United States and rising in many other countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The authors call for coordinated policy action — from more explicit labeling to limits on additives — and warn that, without intervention, UPFs will continue to negatively affect public health, economies, and food cultures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts are once again raising red flags about ultra-processed foods, or UPFs. And this time, they're armed with a growing body of data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In November, researchers published a trio of papers in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2825%2901565-X/fulltext" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing a detailed look at how UPFs might impact our health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The first paper summarizes the evidence, showing that ultra-processed foods are spreading globally," the team wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-call-for-urgent-action-as-ultra-processed-foods-replace-global-diets" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Our second paper outlines policy options for governments that wish to address the problem," and the third, they shared, "asks why ultra-processed foods are taking over human diets and how to mobilize a global public health response." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's what you need to know about their findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-are-ultra-processed-foods-defined"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How are ultra-processed foods defined?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers used the &lt;a href="https://ecuphysicians.ecu.edu/wp-content/pv-uploads/sites/78/2021/07/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; to determine which foods are considered UPF, categorizing products into four groups. The first group includes foods that are completely unprocessed or minimally processed. This minimal processing can include measures of food preservation, including the "removal of inedible or unwanted parts, cutting, drying, crushing, grinding, fractioning, roasting, boiling, pasteurisation, refrigeration, freezing, placing in containers, vacuum packaging, and non-alcoholic fermentation." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group two is for "processed culinary ingredients," which include foods that are still close to their natural state, such as oils, butter, lard, table sugar, honey, and salt. The team also mentioned that these substances "are not consumed alone but are used to season and cook group one foods and turn them into freshly prepared dishes and meals." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group three includes foods that contain added salt, sugar, and oil, such as vegetables in brine, fruits in syrup, canned and cured fish, breads and cheeses, and any "commercial food or drink product made from foods in group one and ingredients from group two."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And last up is group four, which represents ultra-processed foods. "UPFs are branded, commercial formulations made from cheap ingredients extracted or derived from whole foods and combined with additives," the team wrote. "Most contain little to no whole food, and are designed to compete with the other three Nova groups … and maximize industry profits." They noted that these UPFs can have "attractive packaging," and often feature "implied or actual health claims, usually made with synthetic materials, concludes the sequence of processes." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; UPFs also include all "carbonated soft drinks; reconstituted fruit juices and fruit drinks; cocoa, other modified dairy drinks, and energy drinks; flavored yogurt; confectionery; margarines; cured meat or fish with added nitrites or nitrates; poultry and fish nuggets and sticks, sausages, hot dogs, luncheon meats, and other reconstituted meat products; powdered instant soups, noodles, and desserts." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-ultra-processed-foods-are-crowding-out-traditional-diets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Ultra-processed foods are crowding out traditional diets &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand global consumption patterns, the team analyzed dietary surveys from 36 countries and identified a clear trend: UPFs are increasingly replacing traditional, whole-food diets. They found that UPFs now account for between 9% of total energy intake in places like Iran and up to 60% in the U.S. The trend also appears to be rising elsewhere, including in Spain, where UPF purchases rose from 11% to 31.7% of food purchases, and in Canada, where they increased from 24.4% to 54.9% in the span of a few decades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-diet-quality-tends-to-degrade-as-upf-consumption-climbs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Diet quality tends to degrade as UPF consumption climbs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not surprisingly, diets high in ultra-processed foods generally have lower nutritional quality. A meta-analysis across 13 countries revealed that people who consumed the most UPFs ingested more sugar, total fat, saturated fat, and calories, while getting less fiber, protein, and essential micronutrients such as potassium and magnesium. The study also found that those who ate the most UPFs had higher intakes of additives, including food coloring and emulsifiers. Interestingly, the researchers noted that in two studies, participants who ate more UPFs tended to eat more quickly than those who ate less.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-upfs-tend-to-increase-the-risk-of-multiple-chronic-diseases"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; UPFs tend to increase the risk of multiple chronic diseases  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers in this &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; report reviewed 104 prospective studies and found that 92 of them showed a positive association between higher UPF consumption and at least one adverse health outcome. This included everything from increased risk of obesity to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease to depression, and even "all-cause mortality." This finding is supported by other recent studies, including one by &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/ultra-processed-foods-early-colon-cancer-risks-study-11856485" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Harvard researchers&lt;/a&gt;, which found a strong connection between ultra-processed foods and adenomas—masses of cells that are precursors to colorectal cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-the-experts-say-we-can-and-should-do-about-it"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What the experts say we can, and should, do about it &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers clearly outlined potential solutions to improve global food relationships. Their paper presented several policy options, including setting limits on certain additives and implementing "mandatory front-of-pack warning labels, which work well to inform consumers and reduce purchasing." They recommended protecting children from UPF advertising on digital platforms, taxing sugary drinks, and using the revenue to subsidize fruits and vegetables for lower-income households, along with "curbing corporate power." As the experts wrote in their statement, "governments could do more to regulate companies' portfolios and monitor and constrain the proportion of sales from ultra-processed foods; strengthen competition policy and consider tax reforms that curb excessive market power." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While federal government regulation hasn't gone this far yet, some U.S. states are already taking baby steps, including California, which &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/california-passes-assembly-bill-1264-ultra-processed-foods-public-school-meals-11808758" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;approved legislation&lt;/a&gt; in September that will ban ultra-processed foods from public school meals by 2035.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, like any study, this one has limitations too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The claims about the health effects of ultra-processed foods are largely based on observational data," Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading, who wasn't involved in the study, said. "Randomised clinical trials — the gold standard in nutrition research — have not given cause for concern: While they have shown that some ultra-processed foods can result in overconsumption, they have also shown that a diet with ultra-processed foods that follows current dietary guidelines is not detrimental to health."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the researchers said they believe their findings are more than enough to keep the UPF conversation moving forward. "Our papers show that without policy action and a coordinated global response, ultra-processed foods will continue to rise in human diets, harming health, economies, culture, and planet," they wrote. The time to act is now." &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Nova Classification &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick cheat sheet on where your food lands on the Nova classification. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, including whole fruits, vegetables, and grains. They can be preserved using methods such as freezing, drying, or vacuum sealing, but they contain no added fats, sugars, or salts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Includes processed culinary ingredients like oils, butter, honey, and salt, or substances typically used in cooking but rarely eaten on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 3: &lt;/strong&gt;Includes foods made by combining ingredients from the first two groups, such as breads, canned vegetables, and cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes ultra-processed foods made from ingredients extracted or derived from whole foods and combined with additives. The researchers noted that they are usually attractively packaged and designed to mimic freshly prepared foods, and frequently carry implied or direct health claims. This group can include everything from sodas to flavored yogurts to cured meats to instant powdered soups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Parents can also be more intentional about challenging sexist assumptions in the home. Not least since, when men show hostility towards women, which has been dubbed "hostile masculinity", it &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has been linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased incidences of violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On a societal level, policy measures can help address these imbalances, such as providing paid family leave for all workers, men and women alike. This has been successfully implemented in several Nordic countries, where a paid "use it or lose it" approach &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210712-paternity-leave-the-hidden-barriers-keeping-men-at-work" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has increased the number of men taking parental leave&lt;/a&gt;. This in turn normalises and values caregiving and with more support at home, helps keep women more closely tied to the workforce, limiting the economic damage. When men take on more care at home, the very idea of what masculinity is can change and evolve over time, to one that includes caring and better supports women, even developing a different sense of what it can mean to be a man, which has been dubbed "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X15576203" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;caring masculinities&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When women are empowered, it benefits all of society, explains Homan, as women in power tend to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10918039/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;invest more heavily in health care, public health, education, welfare and social safety&lt;/a&gt; programmes that can improve the health of the wider population. "Conversely, greater structural sexism leads to reduced public investment in these areas, harming everyone, including men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And finally, openly talking about the consequences of sexism can help raise awareness of the harms involved. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2480" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;There is even evidence&lt;/a&gt; that speaking out about unwanted discrimination is beneficial for mental health, as it can lead to more support. At the same time, however, we need to acknowledge the structural pervasiveness of the issue and that individual action is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPcXV6VU1pNW9vS2NPdjB5Mzh3d3lBbm9KYkk1QXQ5bmctYkxka0ltWlAtbnZ4azMxd3FLMmNYR2hpSF9SUHhVQlEwYWt0MXFNbm5BOGM5YTZ4N3p2MW9pb3JPUWRjRVFMeEJtQzlTT2dZckpTMXpfWjgwcjZOU1ItUFpKeVZIMG5TYS1rQW1oZ00tOVBsNS1YWUtoOWh0VHJ3bVhkcTBvY2ZOQQ</guid></item><item><title>NPR年度最受欢迎自助故事中的实用建议- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/nx-s1-5634757/useful-tips-npr-most-popular-self-help-stories-of-year</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Did you know that foods like walnuts and yogurt support better sleep? That acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers? That the simplest way to lead a happier life is to just ask yourself whether something will &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;make you happy?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are just a few pieces of expert advice from Life Kit's most read stories of 2025. If you're the kind of person who loves collecting useful tidbits of information, read on for more tips on topics ranging from health to relationships. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tuck them away in your noggin — or save them for a rainy day. You never know when you might need them! &lt;/p&gt;   
      
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States. A highway patrol officer explains how drivers should handle emergency scenarios, from extreme weather to aggressive tailgaters. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5178103/road-safety-tips-highway-emergencies" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't speed. Speeding can make it harder to avoid potential hazards on the road, and it can make car crashes more severe, says Hector Carias, an officer with the California Highway Patrol. If someone is tailgating you, "move over one lane and let them pass. There's no reason for you to speed up."&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div id="resg-s1-74725" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your pelvic floor supports organs like your bladder, bowels and reproductive system. Strengthen it with exercises and mantras (like "squeeze before you sneeze") from physical therapist Sara Reardon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5413369/pelvic-floor-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;"Just say no to &lt;a href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/why-you-shouldnt-push-when-you-pee/" target="_blank"&gt;power peeing&lt;/a&gt;," Reardon says. "Sit, relax and let it flow. Relaxing your pelvic floor allows your bladder, which is a muscle, to push the urine out, and that's really how you're supposed to pee. Sit instead of hovering, breathe and chill, and then your bladder muscle contracts."&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div id="resg-s1-67155" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you eat during the day can affect how well you sleep at night. Sleep researchers explain the impact of diet, caffeine and alcohol on sleep health and share a list of sleep-supporting foods. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5366820/5-eating-habits-that-can-improve-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Seek out foods rich in tryptophan. It's an amino acid we get from food, and in the brain it's converted to serotonin and melatonin, chemicals in our bodies that play an important role in sleep, says &lt;a href="https://www.ihn.cuimc.columbia.edu/profile/marie-pierre-st-onge-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Marie-Pierre St-Onge&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition scientist and researcher at Columbia University and a co-author of the cookbook &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Eat-Better-Sleep-Better/Marie-Pierre-St-Onge/9781982198442" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;You can find tryptophan in almonds, barley, brown rice, chia seeds, lentils, oats, pumpkin seeds, salmon, tofu, turkey, walnuts, white beans and yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;      
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When someone says something nice about us, it can make us feel awkward and uncomfortable. Researchers explain the science behind those emotions and make the case for accepting genuine praise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/02/nx-s1-5442506/hard-to-accept-compliments-comic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the comic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Be kind when someone says something nice to you, especially if it's sincere, say social psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.ericaboothby.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Erica Boothby&lt;/a&gt; and behavioral scientist &lt;a href="https://www.xuan-zhao.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Xuan Zhao&lt;/a&gt;. Try to see that the other person has good intentions and is not trying to be fake or critical of you. So, let yourself accept the good, and choose to believe the nice thing.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div id="resg-s1-58985" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refresh your knowledge on safe and effective use of common painkillers with these tips from health professionals. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5254350/advil-tylenol-which-painkiller-take-when" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers, says University of California, San Francisco clinical pharmacist &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/candy-tsourounis" target="_blank"&gt;Candy Tsourounis&lt;/a&gt;. Commonly known as Tylenol, acetaminophen is thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which recommends using acetaminophen to treat fever and pain in pregnant women, says that untreated fever can cause grave harms such as miscarriage, birth defects or premature birth, especially early in a pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550153/trump-rfk-autism-tylenol-leucovorin-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;reports NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Academic and author Tom Bellamy, author of the book &lt;/em&gt;Smitten&lt;em&gt;, explains how to recognize the signs of limerence, a romantic obsession characterized by extreme emotional highs and lows. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/20/nx-s1-5534087/the-science-of-limerence-romantic-obsession" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Turn your daydreams into your "daymares." Often, when you have a crush, it feels good to fantasize about exciting "happily ever after" scenarios. Bellamy says those daydreams can perpetuate feelings of limerence, so you want to turn them into "daymares."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you had a daydream about driving off into the sunset with them, change it," he says. "Maybe they suddenly shout, 'Stop the car! This is a terrible mistake!' And they run off and you're left feeling foolish and ridiculous."&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div id="resg-s1-44348" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People get a lot wrong when it comes to paying for vacations, say travel experts, and that can cost serious cash. Here's how to plan a trip that's safe, adventurous and under-budget. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/25/nx-s1-5231810/5-money-draining-mistakes-travelers-make-when-planning-a-vacation" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If your dream destination is out of budget, look for an affordable look-alike. For example, if you're considering a trip to California's Napa Valley, maybe look into the Finger Lakes region in New York, says travel journalist &lt;a href="https://muckrack.com/brittney-oliver" target="_blank"&gt;Brittney Oliver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're known for their riesling," she says — and the trip will cost you a fraction of the price.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div id="resg-s1-70324" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes reducing your home's energy use can be as simple as opening a window or buying tape. There are easy ways to have a more climate-friendly home and save on energy bills at the same time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5340706/homes-energy-tips-heating-air-conditioning" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip:&lt;/strong&gt; In places that get very hot, you might want to think about installing shades on the outside of your house, not the inside, says &lt;a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/daniel-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Barber&lt;/a&gt;, a historian of architecture and environment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's why. If you have a blind or curtain inside your house, behind your windowpane,  then the sunlight coming in brings the heat inside.&lt;/p&gt;      
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These creative questions are fun to answer and can help reveal people's personalities. Conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker shares her favorites and explains how to come up with your own. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/29/nx-s1-5355077/want-to-cut-through-small-talk-try-asking-a-magical-question" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip:&lt;/strong&gt; "A magical question is a question that everyone in your group is interested in answering" and hearing the answers to, says Parker, who hosts a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIuJLVUv7RZ/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;video series&lt;/a&gt; on the topic on her Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She shares some ideas: What's the weirdest thing you've ever found in your pocket? What topic could you give a 20-minute talk about with no preparation? What's a path you almost took but didn't?&lt;/p&gt;      
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gretchen Rubin, host of the &lt;/em&gt;Happier&lt;em&gt; podcast, explains the secret to happiness — and why knowing your personality type can help you make better decisions about what can bring you more joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5294584/if-you-want-more-happiness-in-life-ask-yourself-simple-question" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Instead of asking yourself what happiness means to you, Rubin says to ask yourself: "Will this make me happier?" &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People usually have a lot more clarity on the answer. Making choices that can make you happier in the long or short run can move you "in the right direction" toward a life filled with more joy and contentment, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane, with art direction by Beck Harlan.

I have worked in outbreak zones, in understaffed hospitals, in field units built out of necessity. I’ve seen firsthand how vaccines transform the trajectory of a disease, a community, and a country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But nothing has prepared me for the exam room conversations I’m having now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the rise of anti-science and anti-vaccine rhetoric has fundamentally changed the relationship between clinicians and patients. It has made routine preventive care feel like walking into an ideological minefield. Increasingly, it is making it harder and sometimes nearly impossible to protect patients’ health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my clinic, I can feel it before I even speak. With approximately half of my patients, when I bring up vaccines, a tension settles into the room. I see the stiffening of posture, the guarded expression, the subtle shift that says: &lt;em&gt;I’ve already made up my mind&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes patients shut down immediately; other times they start asking me a barrage of questions fueled by the misinformation they have been exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not a disagreement grounded in evidence. It is not a conversation between two people weighing risks and benefits. It is a wall — thick, immovable, and rapidly rising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There has always been some vaccine hesitancy. But what we are experiencing now is something different: entrenched, identity-driven opposition fueled by misinformation, political polarization, and deliberate disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no longer: “I’m nervous” or “I am unsure, can we talk through it?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s: “I don’t believe anything you’re about to say.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a physician, this dynamic is devastating. My job is to protect patients. However, when basic conversations about influenza, measles, Covid-19, or hepatitis B become confrontational before they even begin, it limits my ability to deliver safe, evidence-based care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. today, trust in institutions and public health has eroded so profoundly that many people trust strangers on social media more than clinicians who have cared for them for years. Since these narratives are crafted to provoke fear and sow doubt, they stick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians don’t often talk about the emotional toll of these interactions. But it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I find myself feeling nervous and uncertain before routine discussions that should take seconds. I rehearse what I’m going to say in my mind to anticipate potential landmines. I worry about appearing pushy or triggering defensiveness. I try to determine whether the patient in front of me is willing to hear any scientific information at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I should not feel nervous about mentioning a vaccine that prevents cervical cancer.&lt;br&gt;I should not have to brace myself before recommending a tetanus booster. And I should not walk into a room wondering whether decades of training and years of caring for a patient will be dismissed because of something they saw on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet this is where we are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are not abstract to me. I have seen what happens when communities do not have access to them. I have held the hands of patients dying from diseases that vaccines could have prevented, like tetanus, influenza, and hepatitis. I have worked in wards where infections ripped through families simply because lifesaving interventions arrived too late. I have stood in Ebola treatment units and witnessed the tragic devastation of a virus before an effective vaccine existed — and I have seen the countless lives now saved because &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/07/inside-story-scientists-produced-world-first-ebola-vaccine/"&gt;we finally have one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When patients reject vaccines today, they are rejecting one of the most powerful tools we have to keep them safe, not because the science has changed, but because the information ecosystem has.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That should terrify us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are watching measles, a disease the U.S. eliminated decades ago, roar back to the point where we may soon lose our elimination status. We are watching preventable hospitalizations rise, placing increased strain on health systems and physicians still recovering from the toll of Covid-19. And we are watching public health progress unravel because misinformation now spreads faster and more effectively than truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors are doing everything they can, yet many of us feel increasingly exhausted, disillusioned, and isolated. I hear this constantly from colleagues across infectious diseases, primary care, pediatrics, and public health. We are all carrying the same weight and spending our days trying to counter fear and fiction while public trust erodes. The emotional toll is profound — moral injury from trying to protect patients but being unable to break through the disinformation shaping their choices, burnout from debating the facts repeatedly, and sadness from watching preventable illnesses occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians cannot sustain this alone. We cannot compete with the volume, speed, and emotional manipulation of modern disinformation, especially when we are undermined by institutions, politicians, and influencers who benefit from chaos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect both patients and the clinicians trying to care for them, we need action:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger federal communication that is science-based rather than politically driven&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media platforms must de-incentivize disinformation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public health agencies empowered to communicate clearly and consistently&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Political leaders who stop weaponizing vaccines for partisan gain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Training and education for health workers and public health officials on how to engage in effective and informative vaccine conversations with patients and the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians also need protection both emotionally and professionally. We need institutional support for scientific communication and leadership willing to publicly back clinicians when attacks come. Individual resilience is not enough, and no amount of well-being apps or mindfulness can offset the systemic erosion of trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This moment also carries serious medium- and long-term consequences for the medical workforce. The next generation is watching how physicians and public health professionals are being treated. They are witnessing expertise dismissed, harassment normalized, and burnout accepted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It should not surprise us that recruitment is suffering. Infectious diseases &lt;a href="https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/12/nrmp-celebrates-results-for-the-2025-medicine-and-pediatric-specialties-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fellowship match rates continue to fall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/~/link/2d3059dd8f364a3cb1af882b5c10276e.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than 50% of ID fellowship programs&lt;/a&gt; went unfilled in 2025. This is not just a training issue, it is an early warning signal for a future shortage at a time when complex infections, immunocompromised patients, global outbreaks, and antimicrobial resistant are all increasing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a patient shuts down the moment they hear the word “vaccine,” it’s a sign the system has already failed them. When fear wins over evidence, people become more vulnerable to diseases we know how to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when clinicians walk into exam rooms hesitant to even raise the topic of vaccination, we inch toward a public health landscape shaped not by science, but by noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this continues, outbreaks will worsen, preventable deaths will rise, and clinicians will continue to burn out under the weight of trying to protect patients who have been taught to distrust them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not sustainable — and it is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silence got us here. Leadership must get us out.&lt;/p&gt;

A growing group of researchers is now asking whether this long-standing approach may be missing something important. What if the real path to a cure is not to damage cancer, but to coax it into healing instead?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That provocative idea is at the heart of work led by Professor Indraneel Mittra at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is not completely new. In 1986, an article in the &lt;em&gt;New Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; by Dr. Harold Dvorak suggested that cancer behaves very much like a wound that never heals. Cancer and chronic wounds share many biological features, and Professor Mittra argues that, rather than always trying to destroy tumors, medicine should explore ways to help them move toward a healed, less aggressive state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study involving people with glioblastoma, one of the most feared brain cancers, his team reports that a simple combination of two low-cost nutraceuticals appears to support exactly this kind of healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing a Gentle Strategy in Glioblastoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a fast-growing, highly aggressive brain tumor. Even with modern treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, used alone or together, patients typically survive a median of only about 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;BJC Reports&lt;/em&gt;, Professor Mittra and colleagues enrolled ten patients with glioblastoma and asked them to take a tablet containing small amounts of two nutraceuticals, resveratrol and copper. They took this tablet four times a day for an average of 11.6 days before their scheduled brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of ten patients, whose tumors were similarly aggressive but who did not receive resveratrol and copper, served as the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During surgery, the team collected brain tumor samples from both groups. These samples were then examined in detail using microscopy, immune-staining, immunofluorescence and transcriptome analysis to see how the tumors differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyses showed that the nutraceutical tablets had a striking effect on tumor biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dramatic Changes Inside the Tumors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several key cancer markers shifted in a favorable direction in patients who received the resveratrol and copper tablets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Average levels of the protein Ki-67, a widely used indicator of how quickly glioblastoma cells are dividing, were almost one third lower in treated tumors than in untreated ones. This suggests the cancer was growing less aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Biomarkers associated with nine major "hallmarks of cancer" were present in 57% fewer cells in the treated samples.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Levels of six immune checkpoints, proteins that normally prevent the immune system from attacking cancer cells, were on average 41% lower in the treated tumors.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Three markers linked to stem cells, which may help tumors spread and resist treatment, were 56% lower in the treated group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the patients who took the nutraceutical tablets did not experience any side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic nutraceutical tablet potentially has the power to heal glioblastoma," said Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Cell-Free Chromatin Particles (cfChPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might this apparent healing happen at the cellular level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Mittra, the key action involves resveratrol and copper acting on cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) (cfChPs) that circulate in the body. These are fragments of DNA released from dying cancer cells that can worsen the behavior of surviving cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work from his group showed that when resveratrol and copper are combined, they generate oxygen radicals that deactivate or destroy cfChPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers found that cfChPs were abundant in tissue taken from untreated tumors, but were almost completely absent from tissue taken from tumors in patients who had received the nutraceutical tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that dead cancer cells in the treated group were removed through apoptosis, a controlled cell death process, before they could release cfChPs into the surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mittra explains: "The cell-free chromatin particles, fragments of DNA released by dying cancer cells, inflame the surviving cancer cells. This makes the disease more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you eliminate the cell-free chromatin, which is what the resveratrol-copper tablets do, the cancer is subdued."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that with longer-term use, this approach might possibly lead to complete healing of the cancer, effectively turning a malignant tumor into a benign one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Checkpoints and a Low Cost Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable findings from the study is that the resveratrol-copper tablets reduced the activity of several immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoint inhibition has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy, because blocking these proteins can unleash the immune system against tumors. However, current immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs are extremely expensive and can cause significant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the nutraceutical combination used in this study is simple, non-toxic and inexpensive, yet still appears to downregulate multiple immune checkpoints. This raises the possibility of a more accessible way to influence some of the same pathways targeted by costly cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Potential Shift in Cancer Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach to treating cancer has begun to emerge from these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have been trying to kill cancer cells for 2,500 years, since the time of the ancient Greeks, without success," says Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it is time to look at cancer treatment differently and work towards healing tumors, rather than annihilating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course, the number of patients in this study was rather small. However, the results were so striking that I'd fully expect them to be replicated in a larger sample of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe that we may be on the brink of transforming the way cancer is treated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Indraneel Mittra is Dr. Ernest Borges Chair in Translational Research and Professor Emeritus in the Department of Surgical Oncology at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, through its grant CTCTMC to the Tata Memorial Centre awarded to Indraneel Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The reel from @clairemarchant shows Claire attempting to build a bed like a functioning human. But there’s the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, sticking to her mom’s side with the same intensity toddlers get when they discover a new obsession. The second Claire sits down with the instruction manual, Hazel shifts into full supervisor mode — hovering, nudging, checking in, and offering kisses as if emotional support is part of the build process. It’s easy to imagine her thinking, We’re building this as a unit… yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever kisses mom as she builds bed in a team project effort in cute video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip’s already crossed 3.6k likes, which makes total sense; Hazel brings that signature “I’m here to help, but I have no idea how” energy that this breed has perfected. The clip opens with Claire kneeling inside the bed frame, with instructions nearby. While Hazel parks herself just outside the frame, giving big “assistant manager who won’t actually help” energy. When Claire tries to read the manual, Hazel leans down and gently licks the hand holding the frame, as if cheering her on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The on-screen text reads, “When your Golden has to make everything a team project,” and honestly, that’s the perfect summary. Hazel isn’t casually hanging out; she is emotionally, philosophically, and maybe cosmically invested in this build. The video’s voiceover is that of Russell from Up offering to help Carl, which somehow makes Hazel’s earnestness even funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viewers in the comments immediately recognized the vibe. One person wrote about building an entire backyard deck under the intense supervision of their own “shadow.” Another said they’d just moved and assembled tons of furniture; “none of which required zero golden retrievers,” yet their boy insisted on contributing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hazel didn’t understand a word of the instructions, obviously, but she contributed where it counted: morale boosts and kiss breaks whenever Claire needed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/198789-golden-retriever-mom-team-project-bed-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video Shows How Golden Retriever Makes Everything a Team Project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video Shows How Golden Retriever Makes Everything a Team Project&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 07:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOOVZPT09qTS00ZmJBWWpHd21RZ3RGcmd2SEJmUXRKb0JkU2ZYRkhpVTFBbXNfYUVKXzJOV0M1VGllWXl0NEh2dmgwcjREa1hRZ3J1cmU1WXZvcUp4WjVsODBWSi0tTTFuOUNyUzRENkZoMmJHUklJV1ZaWllvZ2N0MzNBaHlQMWVMQUJjMC14bmtIUkV1</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病正在上升。5个降低患病风险的专家提示- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/parkinson-disease-rise-5-expert-160100849.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;An estimated 25 million people worldwide will be living with Parkinson's disease by 2050. - FG Trade/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="editor-note__prefix vossi-editor-note_elevate__prefix"&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small.

We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/advancing-research/our-research/pdgeneration/genetics-behind-pd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Genetics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11091623/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:environmental toxins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt; — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114824/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the chemicals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the chemicals&lt;/a&gt; with which we regularly come in contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said.

Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get enough sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritize consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deep sleep activates the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain’s built-in cleaning system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain’s built-in cleaning system&lt;/a&gt;, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="editor-note__prefix vossi-editor-note_elevate__prefix"&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  We hope these five tips help you reduce your exposure to environmental and chemical toxins associated with Parkinson’s Disease.

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the line, she said, was the head of the fertility department at a Belgian clinic she had visited in 2011 to undergo fertility treatment, which at the time was not available to would-be single mothers in France. After her daughter was successfully conceived, she said, she had never heard from the clinic again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caller told her that the sperm donor she had used to conceive her daughter carried a rare &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/genetics-and-genomics/t-69899904"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; mutation of the TP53 gene, which suppresses cancerous growth. The mutation is linked to a heightened and lifelong risk of multiple &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; — many of which can develop at a very early age. The caller said her daughter had a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, for which there is no cure or treatment. It was, she was told, "urgent" for her to screen her daughter for the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a shock," said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. "I didn't understand anything." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would soon learn that her daughter did indeed carry the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, after the mutation was detected in his samples, the donor had been permanently blocked in October 2023 by the European Sperm Bank (ESB), which had sold the sperm. Though the clinic maintains that it contacted the woman "as soon as possible," it told her she received the call a year and a half after the ESB discovered the mutation because it had migrated its computer system and initially lost her contact details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sperm donor 7069&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated by the EBU Investigative Journalism Network, an investigation by DW and several other European public broadcasters reveals that, for more than 15 years, women in at least 14 countries in Europe and elsewhere were sold sperm from donor 7069. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035217" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035217_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A sperm bank is viewed from the outside: a red-brick building with bikes parked in front"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The ESB exported donor 7069's sperm to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Iceland to Albania and beyond, at least 197 children were conceived with donor 7069's sperm, the investigation shows. It is possible that the number is far higher — the ESB has yet to disclose the total number of children conceived with his sperm. And so doctors are unable to say whether all of them have even been tested at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a rare and potentially fatal genetic mutation was sold to families across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the donor-conceived children have already developed two different sorts of cancer; others "have already died," said Edwige Kasper, a biologist who specializes in genetic predispositions to cancer. She is counseling some of the affected families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, the sperm bank has the obligation to alert all fertility clinics to which it exported gametes of any genetic abnormalities that arise. The clinics, in turn, inform parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet DW and its partners have learned of several cases of families who were never officially informed that their children might be carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'A big frustration'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorte Kellermann, a single mother who lives in Denmark, said she learned about the case in November 2023 from another parent who had used the donor. She told DW and its partners that she had not been contacted by either the sperm bank or the fertility clinic she had used. And, she said, she was aware of other families — single mothers who had used the same donor, and who had connected via a private Facebook group. The former director of the clinic Kellermann had used said he could not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though DW is unable to verify each of the Facebook group's accounts, they are consistent with those of doctors and reports issued by health authorities across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz, who specializes in hereditary cancers, told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, one of DW's partners in the investigation, that several of her patients in Sweden had never been contacted. She said they had only found out about the mutation through media reports. It was, she said, "a big frustration." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035287" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035287_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz sits in her office, wearing glasses, a blue shirt and a lanyard"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Svetlana Lagercrantz and other doctors say early cancer detection is essential to saving lives&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it took a gathering of hereditary cancer experts in 2024 to realize the extent of the problem. Lagercrantz said a French colleague was talking about patients who had inherited the TP53 mutation from their sperm donor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, she said, doctors from across Europe realized that what they had assumed were singular cases were in fact all fathered by one single donor — spanning the continent and even beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It left her "shaken." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lifelong screening&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy concerns, the ESB has so far refused to provide the exact number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035233" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035233_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="plates on a building identify the offices of the European Sperm Bank"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The European Sperm Bank has refused to provide the exact number of donor 7069's offspring&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since we don't know how many women have children with the donor, you keep thinking: But is there one more child?" Lagercrantz said. For her and her colleagues, it is "hard to let go of that thought." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are found to carry the mutation have to undergo regular and lifelong checkups. As cancer is particularly rare in children, she said, symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted when doctors are not aware of the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earlier you detect the cancer, the better the chance you have to cure it," she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs as early as 2020&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESB's website resembles a dating site, allowing potential clients to browse donor profiles and — for an extra fee — hear audio interviews and view childhood photos. Clients can fork over almost €1,000 ($1,165) for a more comprehensive genetic test than the routine tests sperm is required to undergo in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DW and its partners came across donor 7069's online profile first listed as early as 2007: "Kjeld," a tall white man with light brown hair and brown eyes who was listed as an "M.S. Economy Student." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first warning came in 2020, according to the ESB, when the bank received a notification that a child conceived with Kjeld's sperm had been diagnosed as carrying the TP53 mutation. His sperm was placed under quarantine until further genetic testing.​ ​The results came back negative, as the rare mutation occurs only in some of the donor's sperm cells. The donor himself showed no symptoms. And his sperm was returned to the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the ESB was informed of another child carrying the TP53 mutation. A new round of testing found that the mutation was indeed present in a portion of the donor's sperm. This prompted a permanent ban — and phone calls to parents across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No Europe-wide cap on donor offspring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in Copenhagen, the ESB has emerged as a major player in the global fertility trade, claiming to export sperm to countries across Europe and as far away as Afghanistan and Bolivia. In 2023, the ESB, which is owned by the private investment firm Perwyn, made more than 60 million Danish kroners, or about €8 million, in profit, a significant increase from the 35 million Danish kroners that it had made the previous year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Solo parent by choice" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Solo parent by choice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-60456992" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="60456992" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/60450931_605.webp" data-duration="04:34"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_,sd_sor,sd_avc,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_sd_avc.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business is a lucrative and rapidly growing one as more medical procedures become available and women opt to have children later in life, sometimes on their own or with same-sex partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, donors, who typically donate once a week for six to 18 months, receive €80 per donation, the head of a sperm bank told DW. Their sperm is then washed, analyzed and packaged in so-called straws, longish tubes that are frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each straw sells for €1,000. Becoming &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pregnancy/t-64950283"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive and potentially protracted process: Though some women only need one or two tries, many might need 10 or more — and some never manage to conceive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fertility industry is governed by a patchwork of rules and regulations. Some countries place an age limit on treatments or only allow them for married heterosexual couples. Some allow procedures that are banned in other countries. Some allow anonymous donations of sperm and eggs, which others ban. German patients, for example, may travel to Spain for egg donations, which &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/german-doctors-want-human-egg-donations-to-be-legalized/a-49057057"&gt;are illegal in their home country&lt;/a&gt;; same-sex couples from Poland may travel to Germany for treatments they are denied back home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries place legal limits on the number of children born from one single donor. Others, like Germany, do not, but banks tend to follow industry guidelines of 15 families per donor. Though the European Union passed new regulations on medically assisted reproduction and substances of human origin in 2024, these do not include an EU-wide cap on the number of children born to a single donor. There is currently no international database that tracks donors and prevents them from selling sperm to several banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="71835727" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/71835727_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="a magnified image of sperm as viewed through a microscope"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Donor sperm undergoes medical tests, yet TP53 is not included in the routine tests&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: David Spears/Mary Evans/IMAGO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential donors undergo extensive medical tests, and only a single-digit percentage &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/mobile-phones-might-cause-lower-sperm-count/a-67287821"&gt;make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. The process does not include screening for rare genetic mutations such as TP53. Having invested heavily in a donor, sperm banks have an economic incentive to maximize profit by selling each donor's sperm to several families. ​​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its website, the ESB claims to have set a self-imposed cap on the number of families per donor: "The majority of our donors have a limit of 75 families, but in selected markets (the UK, Ireland, Australia and the Netherlands) we also offer donors with a worldwide limit of 25 families." For an extra fee, prospective buyers can limit the number of families; €39,000 buys exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research by DW and its partners shows that the at least 197 children conceived with donor 7069's sperm clearly exceeded the ESB's own stated polices, as well as national limits in some cases. In Belgium alone, 53 children were conceived using the donor's sperm,​ ​despite national laws that set a limit of six women per donor. This has prompted investigations by Belgian authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-74839704" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="74839704" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/74821788_605.webp" data-duration="26:04"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronted with the findings, the ESB wrote: "We are deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor. They have our deepest sympathy." The ESB "tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately," the ESB wrote in its statement, "we have identified that the limits for how many families a donor can be used for have been exceeded in some countries both in the specific case regarding TP53 and in other cases. This is partly due to inadequate reporting from the clinics, non-robust systems and fertility tourism." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her laboratory in central Berlin, Ann-Kathrin Klym did a double take when she heard the number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. It is, she said, "enormous." Klym heads the laboratory at the Berliner Samenbank, a sperm bank that, with its 10 employees, is a minor player compared with the ESB. Klym showed DW the bank's storage room: big, bulky containers filled with liquid nitrogen, which freezes the sperm. When she removed a lid to show the small straws with frozen sperm housed in each, whitish-grey nitrogen gas swirled out of the tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035269" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035269_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="gloved hand pulls tube, or straw, of semen from a container featuring several such tubes"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Sperm is stored in liquid nitrogen. &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klym said her bank limited donors to 15 families and asked them to sign a declaration that they had not sold sperm to another bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People conceived with donor sperm and their parents are calling for Europe-wide and indeed global caps on the number of children born to one donor. Spenderkinder, an association of donor-conceived children in Germany, told DW that it advocates for a global cap of six families per donor, as well as a global registry of donors. That would also make it easier to find and contact families in a timely manner should sperm banks become aware of diseases and mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'I feel enormous guilt'&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother in France who received the call back in June has since learned that her now-teenage daughter did inherit the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, she and her daughter continue to grapple with what the diagnosis will mean: a lifetime of regular checks and the constant fear of what they might reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she harbored "absolutely no ill feelings" for donor 7069, whose sperm had been sold to scores of families across the continent by the European Sperm Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, she said, he had not known that he was a carrier of the mutation: "He is not to blame." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she said, "I feel enormous guilt — to know that because you chose to conceive that way, you have passed on something that is potentially life-threatening." It is, she added, "very, very hard." &lt;/p&gt;
