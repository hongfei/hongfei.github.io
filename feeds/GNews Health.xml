But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus probably influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr Richard E Shope, a professor at the Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105km) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; parks and wildlife, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency had been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she said that it was not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths do not harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家开发能够解码内部语音的大脑植入物-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality analysis and expert insights, complemented with our award-winning Weekend Print edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ</guid></item><item><title>您需要了解的关于抗癌HPV疫苗的信息- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBzQWdUM2NPdG9NdmVDLVF1V1NYTGlncmtiVzZDUms1VGR0QzJtejNxdXZCcUlWOS1lNnNtcGhzR1hwNWp4ZzhDZ3BXakU0Zkh4b2FPUFNtWHp6VERXdTA1RXBwYTVPNjJwVzNfT3dRX09yaFRRSUlpSUpjX0RyNVnSAYQBQVVfeXFMUGk1YWt1bFNNQmlnczRvSTZFMjdlTjhyS2d3QkxoMlliNml2Y00tWlRGaXJsVXRBeVp3MGlHcmRFSzJFRTN0c2l1UTM3T01ZNjdrMFVYLUVlZ05Hd0Z4SXhVMTNmMXl3d0VSb0tUaEhfRnR6U1B6RmdNU0lqYzRnT1ptbmEz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Imagine if there were a vaccine for breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer or any of the most well-known cancers that sicken and kill so many people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Every year, there are an estimated 48,000 new cases of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, or HPV, in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/hpv-associated-cancers.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00083b6niz3pu3hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000a3b6nxvkzkvyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." target="_blank"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000b3b6n2zpoaf1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000c3b6nkwr3k2vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000e3b6nicln2hpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000f3b6nd7wx69ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000g3b6ng92ih8oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective is the HPV vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000i3b6ndflqdt1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: When is the vaccine recommended to be given?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000j3b6n23gqfa3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;months later.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000k3b6nwpd81413@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000l3b6n3dkpm22u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published in the journal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" target="_blank"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000m3b6nzp3svi53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000o3b6niehszijp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000p3b6nrbfixupz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

He called on the journal to “immediately retract” the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see no reason for retraction,” Dr Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy’s piece, which was not submitted to the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies – especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before,” Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. “I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy had a number of criticisms, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions – including those with the highest levels of exposure – and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact, he said, its design was based on a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180331/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study led by Matthew Daley&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was no control group because in Denmark only 2% of children were unvaccinated, which was too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data was available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data was not released under Danish law, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals of Internal Medicine site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, “they do not invalidate what they found, and there’s no evidence of scientific misconduct”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYllINkJWN2FTaXRtOWtSNTBuZ0ViRWRUYnp0MVhXbnhINVZ6bUhPUUlZTWRkM0xMWFJ0SV9xdnNjQXZWelFBY2FHbjM4ZkRkdlhBcFREc3d0V3l2RWw5UzltVzJ0eDI1OTBBbVJ1WTRWajlpTGZFeHdkZkJBYU9KMGNBTWQ1UElrMWNTaERtQktiNmxZ</guid></item><item><title>两种致命癌症的新疫苗在临床试验中显示出前景- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNOWRnWm9PWFE2c0ZKdVlNTHNGRTl3OXVyd1JRa29vNVpOcGpVNUNmZml5SEotckd0TWFNb19GaFBQLVBXWlhKOVZBX0FMNUdZZnZMRXl3ZVFFaFJrWHQySzctSzE2NjVuNHlTT0ZNUk5jNGRWTTZGN3NmOUc1RV80Q21SMU9YSXlrcDdaRXhDc1puWGZ4WFk4aXNvZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

These mutations are linked to 93 percent of pancreatic cancers and 50 percent of colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coupled with a delivery system that takes the vaccine's active agent straight to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;, the treatment is designed to precisely target parts of the immune system where a variety of immune cells are held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-diets-can-slash-cancer-risk-by-up-to-45-large-study-finds"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Can Slash Cancer Risk by Up to 45%, Large Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting advance for patients with KRAS-driven cancers, particularly pancreatic  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171262" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, where recurrence after standard treatment is almost a given and effective therapies are limited," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical oncologist Zev Wainberg, from the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was tested on 20 people recovering from pancreatic cancer and five people recovering from colorectal cancer.

For cancers this aggressive, those are all impressive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed that patients who developed strong immune responses to the vaccine remained disease-free and survived for much longer than expected," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the people who participated in the study, there was a median relapse-free survival of 16.33 months and a median overall survival of 28.94 months, both way beyond what's normally expected &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-prognosis"&gt;in cancers like these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these results even better is that ELI-002 2P is what's known as an 'off-the-shelf' vaccine, which means it's a standard treatment that doesn't need to be personalized for each person (a process which takes time and expertise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional trials and testing will be necessary to fully evaluate the risks and benefits, but considering the high recurrence and mortality rates of pancreatic and colorectal cancers, there's strong evidence here that this vaccine could add years of health to people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also saw positive signs of the vaccine training the immune system to fight other types of cancer mutations too, so there's the potential for it to be even more useful in efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;improve treatments&lt;/a&gt; going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting KRAS has long been considered one of the difficult challenges in cancer therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg. "This study shows that the ELI-002 2P vaccine can safely and effectively train the immune system to recognize and fight cancer-driving mutations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It offers a promising approach to generating precise and durable immune responses without the complexity or cost of fully personalized vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03876-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s pretty normal. In fact, up to 29% of people report feeling the urge to go after sipping a cup of coffee, according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “Coffee can cause diarrhea in some people,” Dr. Ravella said. “The caffeine can stimulate the gut to contract more quickly than it normally does, so food moves through faster and isn’t absorbed as well.” The acidity of coffee can also worsen the symptoms of some digestive disorders, such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20496948/6-weird-signs-you-have-acid-reflux/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acid reflux;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;. Other caffeinated foods and drinks, including tea and energy drinks, could have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fotograzia - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a few too many during a night out (or in!), you may wake up with an upset stomach the next morning. “This is often a symptom that accompanies a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a22789047/hangover-cures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hangover;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said. “Alcohol is an irritant. Your gut may not agree with drinking a large amount.” Booze also speeds up digestion and pulls water into your digestive tract, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/diarrhea-after-drinking-alcohol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;—hence the liquid stools when you’re hungover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;marina200707 / 500px - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dairy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/documents/NICHD_MM_Lactose_FS_rev.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, up to 50 million American adults may be lactose intolerant and could benefit from limiting their consumption of dairy or cutting it out altogether. If your stomach goes rogue when you eat milk, cheese, or yogurt, you may be one of them. “Common symptoms, which begin about 30 minutes to two hours after consuming foods containing lactose, may be diarrhea, nausea, cramps, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20472936/best-remedies-for-gas-and-bloating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gas, and bloating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gas, and bloating&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Image Source - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wheat, Rye, and Barley&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluten—a mix of proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley—can cause diarrhea and bloating for up to 15% of people, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/go-with-your-gut-4-facts-about-gluten-intolerance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwestern Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwestern Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping track of any GI symptoms you experience after eating bread, pasta, and grains or cutting out these foods to see if your symptoms disappear will help you find out if you're one of them. “If you think you have gluten intolerance, it’s important to see a gastroenterologist to make sure you don’t have celiac disease,” Dr. Ravella added. For people with this disorder, gluten can do serious damage by causing the body to attack the lining of the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;apomares - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Condiments and Salad Dressings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store-bought condiments, dressings, and sauces might contain traces of gluten in the form of ingredients like malt vinegar or wheat starch to help thicken the texture and add flavor, said &lt;a href="https://celiacdiseasecenter.columbia.edu/about-the-center/celiac-disease-center-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of nutritional medicine in the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University. Try preparing your own dressings and sauces at home if you have a gluten intolerance, or carefully read the ingredient labels at the store to avoid any hidden triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jeff Greenberg - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-FODMAP Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. They’re a group of carbs and sugar alcohols that can be tough to digest, especially for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Dr. Ravella said, leading to gas, bloating, and diarrhea. A &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-FODMAP diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; may help improve symptoms, but should be monitored by a dietitian, as it requires you to cut out certain foods rich in vital nutrients. According to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, High-FODMAP foods include dairy, wheat, beans, lentils, artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, garlic, apples, cherries, and peaches, while foods low in FODMAPs include eggs, meat, rice, quinoa, potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, pineapple, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Thanasis - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-Fiber Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber gets your digestive system moving, which is a good thing—but sometimes it’s a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; effective, Dr. Shah warned. Fiber binds with water, which can help prevent constipation but may also have a laxative effect if you consume too much at once. Plus, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/fiber-and-lactose" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCSF Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCSF Health&lt;/a&gt;, eating a lot of insoluble fiber (the type found in nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and whole grains) can speed up digestion, leading to watery stool. That's not to say you shouldn't be eating plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25922606/high-fiber-low-carb-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;—just be sure to increase your fiber intake gradually until your stomach adjusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jordan Lye - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spicy Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can eat jalapeños like they’re candy, while others feel their stomach churn at the mere sight of a chili pepper. “Each individual is unique when it comes to tolerating spicy foods,” Dr. Ravella said. “Spicy foods can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, causing food to move more quickly through the gastrointestinal tract, which results in loose stools.” If you don’t eat spicy food often, she added, you’re more likely to feel the burn (and the potential digestive side effects) when you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;by JBfotoblog - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast Food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need motivation to skip the drive-thru window, consider that greasy takeout grub can be hard on your gut. “In general, all fats can be harder to digest, but the worst culprits are the fats in greasy, fried foods typically found at fast food restaurants,” Dr. Ravella said. “You’re less likely to have issues when eating healthy fats from whole foods, like avocados.” Indeed, a recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/11/1838" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that fast food consumption was associated with an increased risk of having inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, making issues like diarrhea that much more likely to occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Cavan Images - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Packaged Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like fast food, processed and packaged foods from the grocery store often contain lots of the hard-to-digest ingredients listed above. Be sure to read nutrition labels and ingredient lists carefully, and be on the lookout for gut-irritating and hard-to-digest ingredients like sugar substitutes, dairy, gluten, or FODMAPs.

And if you’re experiencing any of these challenges, here are expert-backed strategies to help improve your sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sleeping And Waking At Atypical Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though often seen as simply being a night owl, there’s actually a strong neurological overlap between ADHD and circadian rhythm disruptions like delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People with ADHD often experience a delayed release of melatonin, making it harder to feel sleepy at conventional times,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brentwoodtherapycollective.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Chelsea Sarai" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.brentwoodtherapycollective.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Chelsea Sarai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, clinical psychologist and founder of the Brentwood Therapy Collective. “Combined with difficulty transitioning between tasks and regulating internal cues, their sleep-wake cycles naturally shift later and later, often without them realizing it.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain of someone with DSPS is wired to come alive at night, which makes it challenging to match typical daily routines. A way to gradually shift one’s sleep schedule earlier is by getting exposure to natural light in the morning to help reset the body’s internal clock. “In the evening, reducing blue light exposure and maintaining a consistent wind-down routine can reinforce those shifts,” Sarai said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Difficulty ‘Shutting Off’ The Brain At Night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feeling physically tired but mentally alert can lead to long nights awake, and growing sleep debt. “A hallmark of ADHD is difficulty regulating attention, not just focusing when needed, but also knowing how to mentally disengage,” Sarai said. “At night, when external distractions fade, the brain suddenly has space to process everything that’s been pushed aside during the day. This often leads to a surge of racing thoughts or mental ‘noise’ that makes it hard to wind down and fall asleep.” These thoughts can resemble anxiety, but Sarai notes they’re not always anxious — they might be creative ideas or hyperfixations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be realistic about how long it takes to fall asleep and create a wind-down routine to support it. “It could look like writing down all the thoughts in one’s head before bed as a way to honor those creative thoughts and trust that you will get back to them at a more appropriate time,” Sarai said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Trouble Waking Up Despite Adequate Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trouble waking up despite getting enough sleep is often brushed off as laziness, poor self-discipline or even a sign of depression. But in many cases, it can be attributed to having a delayed circadian rhythm and the ADHD brain struggling to shift from sleep to wakefulness, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Zishan Khan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Zishan Khan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and regional medical director at Mindpath Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the morning can also lead to grogginess, poor motivation and difficulty activating for the day,” he added. He suggests regulating the sleep-wake cycle by implementing consistent bedtimes and wake times, even on weekends, and using visual cues or alarms that gradually increase in volume or light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Using Screens To Fall Asleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those with ADHD often turn to screens to calm a restless mind. “The sensory stimulation — visual, auditory or narrative — can help distract from intrusive thoughts or anxiety, making it easier to drift off,” Khan said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For some, screens even mirror the level of internal alertness they’re used to, which paradoxically helps them settle. But because screens suppress melatonin and delay sleep onset, even if someone falls asleep while using one, their sleep quality may still suffer from continued stimulation or disrupted sleep cycles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support better sleep, try gradually replacing screen time with low-stimulation options like audiobooks, white noise or guided meditations. “Establishing a 30- to 60-minute wind-down period before bed is crucial, ideally involving non-screen activities that still provide sensory regulation, such as dim lighting, gentle music or tactile tools like weighted blankets,” Khan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Bedtime Procrastination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delaying bedtime despite knowing it’s time to sleep is often tied to poor time perception and difficulty shifting away from preferred activities. “People with ADHD may hyperfocus on an enjoyable task late into the evening or delay sleep because it represents the end of their ‘free time’ after a demanding day,” Khan said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In kids and teens, this can be mistaken for defiance. A consistent, rewarding bedtime routine with built-in cues and transitions can help. “Visual timers, reminders and positive reinforcement can help signal the winding-down process,” Khan said. “For those with ADHD, it’s key to build in extra time for this process, as it often takes longer than expected to shift gears.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.

These disruptions can prevent the brain from cycling through all the important stages of sleep, especially deep and REM sleep, leading to grogginess, reduced focus and memory, and less impulse control the next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you wake up at night, avoid checking the clock or using screens, which can increase alertness. Instead, Moshfegh suggests practicing stimulus control: if you’re awake for 15 to 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, dim-light activity like reading or stretching until you feel sleepy. “This helps recondition the brain to associate the bed with sleep, not wakefulness.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Oversleeping On Days Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleeping in on days off often reflects an attempt to make up for late or inconsistent bedtimes during the week. “Without external structure, they revert to their intrinsic rhythm of going to bed and sleeping in later,” Moshfegh said of those with ADHD. “Oversleeping on weekends leads to social jet lag, a mismatch between biological and social clocks.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can make it harder to fall asleep Sunday night and leave you tired at the start of the week. To keep your sleep on track, stick to consistent wake-up times and get morning light, either by going outside or using a light therapy box, within 30 to 60 minutes of waking. “This light acts as a strong cue to anchor your internal clock and reduce daytime sleepiness,” Moshfegh said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Most people with polio do not feel sick or suffer minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. In rare cases, polio causes permanent loss of muscle function (paralysis) and can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4O5MCYS4NEWNBYO73YEENY5VI"&gt;Besides getting vaccinated, the CDC urged travelers to wash their hands regularly and avoid contaminated water and foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GM33ZYCKQ5GMPBR4J4VPWIVKIY"&gt;“Good hand washing practices can help prevent the spread of this disease. Because the virus that causes polio lives in the feces (poop) of an infected person, people infected with the disease can spread it to others when they do not wash their hands well after defecating (pooping),” the CDC said. “People can also be infected if they drink water or eat food contaminated with infected feces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

group," says Mary Fewtrell, a professor of paediatric nutrition at University College London. "You've got to make sure that the infant and the child get enough of the nutrients that they need to grow and develop properly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Younger children have a high requirement for energy micronutrients, and as a result "animal-sourced foods are a good option because they provide all of those nutrients", Fewtrell says. "If you just give them plants, they're very high in fibre. It fills them up, and then there's a risk that they may not then be able to consume enough nutrients because the nutrient density can be very low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Fewtrell has co-authored &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/723" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522007341?via%3Dihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vegan and vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; children who don't supplement are at risk of being deficient in Vitamin B12, iodine and iron. These nutrients are more readily available in animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You could say, well, OK, if they didn't get the nutrients they need, it might have a short-term effect and you could remedy it.

                There's a growing consensus among researchers on how many daily steps are needed to improve health.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;From pricey wearable devices to your phone, it has never been easier to track your daily physical activity, or lack of it. And if you're like many Americans — and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" target="_blank"&gt;spend 9-plus hours&lt;/a&gt; sitting everyday — chances are you could probably stand to&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213518585/so-much-sitting-looking-at-screens-can-we-combat-our-sedentary-lives" target="_blank"&gt; take a few more steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But just how many should you aim for if you want to live a longer and healthier life? New research suggests 7,000 is a good target.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have made big strides in the science of step-taking over the past decade, gathering tons of data.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And no surprise, they find the more you move, the less likely you are to die from cardiovascular disease and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, they've also concluded that the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/29/727943418/do-you-really-need-10-000-steps-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;widely-cited target&lt;/a&gt; of 10,000 steps is not rooted in solid science — it grew out of a Japanese promotional campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, a number of studies have now landed on a new number to keep in our heads as we trudge through the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;7,000 steps tends to be the range where there seems to be diminishing return on investment for increasing more steps," says &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/melody-ding.html" target="_blank"&gt;Melody Ding&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ding is the latest researcher to dive into the evidence, as part of an effort to update the physical activity guidelines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her team reviewed data collected from more than 160,000 adults around the world on the link between step count and a variety of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among their findings: Taking 7,000 steps per day was associated with nearly a 50% lower risk of dying compared to the bare minimum of 2,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; also showed the chance of developing cancer fell by 25%, type 2 diabetes 14%, cardiovascular disease 25%, symptoms of depression 22% and dementia 38%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Ding says there were still &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvements for those who exceeded 7,000 steps, but overall they saw "diminishing returns on investment," meaning the added health benefits across the population become smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It definitely doesn't do harm if you go beyond 7,000," she says, "So for anyone who's already doing 10,000 and more, there is no point of going back, but for the folks who are finding it harder to get there, 7,000 could be a really realistic target."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research underscores that, on the lower end, even a modest jump in steps can have a major impact on your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, simply jumping from 2,000 to 4,000 steps in a day was accompanied by nearly a 36% lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work from Ding's team reflects a growing consensus in the scientific literature that around 7,000 steps could be a reasonable target for the public. (There is some variation in the exact number depending on the study.) &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/about/directory/amanda-paluch" target="_blank"&gt;Amanda Paluch&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783711" target="_blank"&gt;published two meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; on step count and health, has found a similar range as this latest study, though her work suggests the step targets may also vary with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were seeing that older adults did not seem to need as many steps compared to younger adults," says Paluch, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specifically, Paluch's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the decreased risk of dying appeared to plateau between 6,000 to 8,000 steps for people in their 60s and older, versus 8,000 to 10,000 for younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says this latest study is one of the first to consider a broader array of health outcomes than just mortality and cardiovascular disease, but cautions some of the results, such as those related to cancer, depression and dementia, are still somewhat "preliminary" because they're based on only a few studies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have also tried to pin down whether speed makes a difference. Here, the new &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study could not make any definitive conclusions, in part because there are various ways to measure intensity and differences could simply reflect better overall fitness and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We actually don't see an association once we consider the total number of steps," says Paluch, who has also looked at this question. "So, essentially, the total number of steps, regardless of how fast you're walking, seems to have a benefit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal government's current &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/PAG_Advisory_Committee_Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; don't actually recommend a daily step target. Instead, they focus on time, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/php/guidelines-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommending 150 to 300 &lt;/a&gt;minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week for adults, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/william-erle-kraus" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Kraus&lt;/a&gt;, who worked on those guidelines, would love to see steps included the next time they are updated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Because they're objective measures that anyone can get off their phone, right?" says Kraus, a cardiologist whose lab studies exercise and health at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says ultimately both approaches to measuring physical activity reflect the same thing  — the amount of energy being burned up through movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the more energy expenditure that you consume with physical activity, the greater benefit you get," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And because the point is to get physical activity – and expend energy – it doesn't have to be just steps. Kraus says you can translate one mile of walking into one fifth of a mile swimming, or five miles cycling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Melody Ding at the University of Sydney says she likes to think of movement in the same way as diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just like we need a balanced, healthy diet, it's important for us to have balanced physical activity, training throughout the week as well," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In other words, get those steps, but also make time for mobility and strength training. All of it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you are counting steps, Kraus emphasizes that the evidence pointing to roughly 7,000 steps a day should not discount the value of doing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; steps, even if the upsides that have been studied so far become incremental above that number.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everybody wants to know how little I need to do. That is the wrong question," he says, "Anything is better than nothing, more is better than less."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What's more, the calculations appear to change when you factor in how much time people spend sitting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He cites &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27475271/" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that suggests&lt;/a&gt; people need to aim higher than 7,000 or even 10,000 if they spend eight hours in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you can get 13,000 steps, you can get rid of all the negative risks that are associated with sitting, " he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked—the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including "Frankenstein bunnies," "demon rabbits" and "zombie rabbits." But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; that causes &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cervical+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rabbit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

This study suggests a depletion of a natural element, and how restoring that balance could potentially impact all the major hallmarks of the disease — the plaques, the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh4731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tangles&lt;/a&gt;, and cognitive function itself,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parulekar said that these findings could potentially lead to new ways to both treat and detect Alzheimer’s disease, but in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like starting a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you start early, it can prevent heart disease. But even if you’ve already had a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, starting that same healthy plan can still help you. It won’t undo the past damage, but it will make your body stronger and help slow down future problems. Similarly, lithium seems to make the brain healthier and more resilient. So, it could be used as a treatment to protect the brain cells that are still healthy and slow down the progression of the disease in people who already have it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/g.-peter-gliebus/2730213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Peter Gliebus&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a neurologist, and director of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gliebus, who was not involved in the recent study, said his first reaction to its findings is one of cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings indicate that lithium exhibits a substantial impact on brain health and may mitigate the early molecular alterations associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study underscores the potential of lithium replacement therapy as a preventive or therapeutic intervention. This discovery holds a promise as it presents novel avenues for addressing the disease at its earliest stages, potentially slowing or even halting its progression,” Gliebus explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These findings have the potential to contribute to the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in the future,” he continued. The study shows lithium deficiency as an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, potentially serving as a biomarker for early detection. Measuring lithium levels in the brain could enable the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing the disease.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, the therapeutic application of lithium orotate, which circumvents plaque sequestration, demonstrates promise in reversing or preventing pathological alterations in animal models,” Gliebus added. “If these findings are validated in human studies, lithium replacement therapy could emerge as a viable treatment option, particularly for individuals experiencing early cognitive decline or at elevated risk for Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPNkhxTUtXYl9TZ2l0QVRmSG0tWUxTdU5ISW04dDY4N1pDeFZydXdGbWJLdk5EZGpra29JbzNoUEJyRWVGcjV3MFFYUVBvS20tZEJvVG10UWhoSmZXYW5CcEVZM0wzMUxIb3Z3N0pHdEhQVEhadk0yalJ2T2lUeGpVTjhrT0l1RW1OZUtlRG0xRFNVTTFPLXFmZHp3bXN5bVI5OFliRA</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州，有“角”的兔子被称为“弗兰肯斯坦兔子”。’原因如下-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 02:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c</guid></item><item><title>1800万美国人遵循的肮脏习惯与惊人的精神分裂症激增有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 18 million Americans who use cannabis daily have drastically increased their odds of developing schizophrenia, a serious mental disorder that can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The grim findings come from a new report by the Canadian Medical Association Journal which revealed that patients needing hospitalization because of cannabis-related health problems were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms could range from severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13482157/People-ancient-viruses-DNA-prone-depression-study-reveals.html"&gt;psychiatric symptoms&lt;/a&gt;

That's roughly one in every 200 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 76 percent of those who do experience these symptoms for more than 24 hours end up needing emergency care - sending their chances of developing schizophrenia skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schizophrenia is treated with a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antipsychotic drugs, like risperidone and olanzapine can help manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions by balancing brain chemicals. Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients cope with symptoms and improve their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 18 millions Americans report using cannabis products on a daily basis (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for regular cannabis users who haven't developed mental health problems, study authors said there is one definitive way to reduce their risk: stop using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, the report warned that continuing to use cannabis after an initial episode of psychosis led to an increased risk that the symptoms would return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using cannabis, especially high-potency products with more than 20 percent THC, can cause some people to experience severe nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rapid heart rate, chest pains that mimic a heart attack, or fainting can also occur and require an urgent trip to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdosing on THC, particularly from consuming edibles or using vapes, can lead to extreme confusion, agitation, or a loss of coordination, all of which can increase the risk of a serious accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among users with pre-existing mental health conditions, cannabis-related health problems can include worsening symptoms of anxiety or depression, such as severe mood swings or suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis’ status in the US has been complex for years, with recreational use legal in 24 states and Washington DC, and medical use allowed in 38 states as of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it remains a Schedule I drug federally, classified as highly dangerous with no accepted medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden administration proposed moving cannabis to Schedule III in May 2024, recognizing its potential as a medical treatment, but a January 2025 hearing was canceled, leaving the decision to the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:42:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc</guid></item><item><title>官员：鳕鱼角游泳运动员感染了可能导致“食肉”疾病的罕见细菌- Boston.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOeFloOHFVekwxVzdzMDhseWZxMFhfYzZiS0hOSi1DdUtZLU1ZeXdwNXFEajNRYzVKR283WmRyaG0yVGNPTTdvbTdsc3kzR05vbmtQdWhlZHAtR1Bya2VXbTlVbXdrWU9CaVI3UjdMZTRBUi04eHQ2c3hDaEhkdEhIRU5DVHpDYV9TMHk3WWFaNnFGbG1Qazl3WjhvU1pFaGh4R1ZvQjhDY2xwTDVocmJrZnczekdYcVBiQ1RyUmVWay1lN3g0d0lQQnZ6ZS1ITWRSd1ZQS3p3Rl_SAeABQVVfeXFMTUY3dUJxNldPQkpQbHBHaGR3SDdra0lVUEVSdzFEYzJhMXk5WU8tdGRpNVFSZXdkQnRHVy1RSm03ZjBYSGc5WXliUXBJUEt5cF8wYmlFWHBwTlVOYlk3bkVUT2ZsRzlKREVxTEJSWXhCYkdJYnFsVkg2elhraTFxWVRoNVpSWXdibWk2WnNnT05xWDlpUTNUSDQ4U2hGUFVJX3czaDd0OWxxNGNxOEptUGdPRTZEMkdMM3kzTEpMYXl3OXZVZFZveWJaX0FheGZzZ2c1LXlGZmZscHp5cWpEdUY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="content-well content-well--article" role="main"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts public health officials issued a warning Wednesday about the presence of a rare and potentially dangerous bacteria in the state’s coastal waters after a swimmer contracted an uncommon infection on &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/cape-cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vibrio vulnificus infection, from Vibrio bacteria, was identified last week in an “older individual” who went swimming with an exposed wound at Old Silver Beach in Falmouth, Falmouth and Barnstable County health officials &lt;a href="https://www.falmouthma.gov/1579/Vibrio-vulnificus"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Silver Beach remains open, the Cape officials said, noting that the infections from the bacteria remain “extremely uncommon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cape Cod’s beaches are an important part of our economy, culture, and community,” Scott McGann, health agent for the Town of Falmouth, said in a statement. “By taking a few simple precautions, residents and visitors, and particularly anyone who is vulnerable or immunocompromised, can continue to enjoy them safely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to monitor bathing water for Vibrio bacteria, according to Falmouth officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;state health officials&lt;/a&gt;, there have been seven confirmed cases of Vibrio vulnificus in Massachusetts in the last several years, including four who were likely exposed in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from the bacteria are more common in warmer waters along the Gulf Coast, according to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, most infections from Vibrio bacteria result from people consuming shellfish containing the bacteria, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone exposed to the bacteria can get an infection, but immunocompromised people or those with a chronic illness, young children, and pregnant people are at greater risk from developing severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vibrio bacteria normally live in warm, salt or brackish waters along the Atlantic coast,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “Heat waves and above-average water surface temperatures create favorable conditions for Vibrio bacteria to grow, making May through October generally the peak season for these bacteria. People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Vibrio infections can lead to the “flesh-eating” disease called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which results in the death of the flesh around the infected wound, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms of a Vibrio infection include fever, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have an open wound that has been exposed to warm, coastal waters are advised to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection for seven days and are advised to seek medical attention if they develop fever, chills, dangerously low blood pressure, blistering skin lesions or any redness, pain, swelling, warmth, discoloration, or discharge at the site of the wound,” state health officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent wound infections from Vibrio bacteria, health officials advise staying out of coastal waters or using a waterproof bandage over any open wounds. People with open wounds should also avoid handling raw seafood, and any wounds should be washed with soap and water after coming into contact with coastal water or raw shellfish, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re really seriously considering not doing COVID vaccines this year,” said Laura Kittross, public health program manager for the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission, which coordinates with 18 Western Massachusetts municipalities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy’s open skepticism of vaccines and his recent decisions that include changing guidelines on who should get COVID vaccines have state officials and public health professionals questioning whether they can continue to rely on what used to be a smooth-running system. In response, Massachusetts officials are exploring creating an alternate vaccine policy, which could include an unprecedented collaboration with neighboring states to replicate some of the work federal health agencies&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;typically perform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“At this moment we can’t always look to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for the guidance we received previously,” Dr. Robbie Goldstein, the state’s commissioner of the Department of Public Health, said during a DPH-hosted panel Wednesday that focused on vaccination. “This is a little bit of building the plane while we fly it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discussion was eagerly awaited by health providers throughout Massachusetts who say keeping up with vaccine recommendations is difficult enough without conflicting messages from Washington. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Pediatricians are overwhelmed and really looking for guidance,” said Dr. Everett Lamm, cochair of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Immunization Initiative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Typically, a CDC advisory panel every June&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends vaccines for seasonal spikes in flu, RSV, and, more recently, COVID. Under Kennedy, that process has been haphazard. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/"&gt;he fired&lt;/a&gt; every member of the committee, and replaced them with a smaller group who generally have less experience with vaccines but share some of his political positions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;An HHS spokesperson said Kennedy considered the previous version of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, as a rubber stamp that failed to critically evaluate scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints on ACIP,” the HHS statement said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The spokesperson did not reply to questions about the delayed COVID shot recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new ACIP committee members recommended &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; that thimerosal, a preservative, be eliminated from all vaccines. The mercury-containing compound is used in just 4 percent of flu doses in the United States but has long been associated, falsely, with autism. The panel’s decision to give credence to a debunked conspiracy theory alarmed health experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think the level of trust for information coming out of the CDC right now is somewhere between negative one and zero,” said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota vaccine expert who participated in the forum Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For local authorities such as Kittross, the delay hinders efforts to protect people in one of the state’s least vaccinated regions. By this time last year, groups such as the regional planning commission would have begun ordering roughly 2,000 COVID vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While Berkshire County’s lower inoculation rates are in part due to a streak of vaccine hesitancy, Kittross said, it is also a consequence of limited access to medical care in a rural area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think it’s really difficult for people here,” she said. “You don’t walk past a CVS on your way to work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It isn’t too late to order COVID vaccine, she said, but the clock is ticking, and at roughly $120 a dose, it’s a cost local health departments cannot afford to foot without a guarantee insurers will reimburse them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many of the state’s 351 local public health agencies face the same uncertainty, said Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Alliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Many are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;making decisions about ordering vaccines until they know there will be insurance coverage,” she said. “If there isn’t, they will be unable to order.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hospitals, too, are waiting to learn whether their workers will be required to get COVID shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s time to preorder COVID vaccines, and we don’t even know who will qualify for COVID vaccines in the fall,” said Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The website for the CDC advisory panel notes a meeting is expected to be held in August or September. If it does end up recommending COVID vaccines, providers would have time to obtain doses for the coming winter, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The confusion and changing guidance from the federal government prompted Governor Maura Healey to &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf"&gt;propose legislation&lt;/a&gt; in July to give the state more leeway in determining which vaccines are covered by its&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Vaccine Purchase Trust Fund, which funds free inoculations for children. Right now, the fund can support only vaccines recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts is in discussions with Connecticut, Maine, New York, and Rhode Island to coordinate vaccine recommendations without input from the CDC panel, public health officials said. While in the planning stages, states would likely rely on advice from national professional societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease Society of America, to provide coordinated guidance to public health and medical providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, an initiative run by Osterholm of the University of Minnesota called the Vaccine Integrity Project is gathering reams of information on vaccines to help professional societies make recommendations. He acknowledged it will not be able to replicate in total the work of the CDC advisory committee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That was a pretty seamless system in terms of assessment,” &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Osterholm said. “I would just say that it’s our loss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other health experts said it is important participating states coordinate recommendations, both to bolster public trust and increase the likelihood insurers will cover vaccines without federal approval. Each state giving its own vaccine recommendations would cause chaos, experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s OK for us to tweak the language a little bit but it’s not OK for each of us to have a different recommendation,” Goldstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It is unclear, though, if insurers, which are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC panel, would do the same for those  suggested  by regional public health collaboratives. In a statement, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Massachusetts’ largest private insurer, said it did not rely exclusively on CDC recommendations to determine what vaccines it would cover. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We strongly support vaccine access and view it as a critical part of public health and preventive care,” Blue Cross said in the statement. “When deciding what vaccinations to cover, we examine the published evidence as well as national guidelines from expert bodies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein said other insurers have been open to relying on vaccine authorities other than the federal government. It saves insurers money to prevent costly illnesses in their customers, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;MassHealth, the state-run Medicaid program, said in a statement that it is able to cover vaccines not recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy has in many ways reshaped the federal public health apparatus to reflect his skeptical, and in some cases unproven views on vaccine safety and efficacy. The CDC lifted COVID vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women and this month Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/"&gt;canceled $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in federal funding for research to create new mRNA vaccines. MRNA vaccines protected millions of people during COVID and can be produced quickly, making them a potentially lifesaving resource during another pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet even if Massachusetts can establish a vaccine policy independent of Washington, the fracturing of what used to be a consensus among public health authorities could worsen the country’s already significant undercurrent of vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think we’re already seeing that it’s impacting vaccination rates,” Goldstein said. “National rhetoric has increased vaccine hesitancy on all types of vaccines.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

				&lt;p&gt;The risk for West Nile virus is now considered “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities, state public health officials warned Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-health&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAspK-_4iPAxWVFFkFHQ6RIWcQFnoECCAQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1Nt9w5EPciyZ4g-9AUvB"&gt;Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; said the level of West Nile virus is now considered high in Acton, Bedford, Billerica, Boston, Brookline, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, and Newton, based on mosquito samples taken from those communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes of the year were confirmed on June 17, and since then 168 samples have been detected across Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester counties, DPH said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[West Nile virus] findings in mosquitoes have accelerated rapidly over the last several weeks,” State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “We are now in the peak time for transmission of mosquito-borne disease to people and it is important for people to know that so they can take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no human cases of West Nile yet this year, but a goat in Lunenburg was diagnosed with the illness. Nineteen people in the state contracted the illness last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t experience symptoms, but some can develop headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and body aches. Most recover on their own without medical assistance, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to Boston health officials&lt;/a&gt;. But, people who are over the age of 50 or immunocompromised are at risk of developing severe illness from West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased risk level for West Nile virus in Boston is a reminder that protecting yourself and your families from mosquito bites is important,” Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s Commissioner of Public Health, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Residents should take precautions like using mosquito repellent and avoiding outdoor activities from dusk to dawn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus isn’t the only mosquito-borne illness public health officials are urging residents to protect against. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/23/mosquitos-in-central-mass-town-test-positive-for-eee/"&gt;also been detected&lt;/a&gt; in mosquitoes in the state this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials said Belchertown, Bridgewater, Carver, East Bridgewater, Easton, Granby, Halifax, Hanson, Lakeville, Middleborough, Pelham, Plympton, Raynham, Taunton, Ware, and West Bridgewater are considered at moderate risk for EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no confirmed human cases of EEE so far this year. In 2024, there were four human cases, with one fatality, and three animal cases of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both West Nile virus and EEE pose risk to the people in Massachusetts,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “The weather remains warm and somewhat humid, which increases mosquito activity. I encourage everyone to take measures to protect themselves: use mosquito repellent when outdoors, wear long sleeves and pants, and be aware of peak mosquito hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using insect repellent and avoiding peak mosquito biting hours (dusk to dawn), officials are urging residents to take steps to protect their homes and animals by draining standing water and installing or repairing screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE and West Nile virus in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County officials reported its 10th  confirmed animal rabies case of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On
Wednesday, staff with Franklin County Animal Services said they have been
working to make sure infected animals are managed safely, and that the
community is aware of positive cases in the area. Officials said they work
closely with Franklin County Health Department to make sure rules for
quarantining and isolation of animals are being closely followed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve
already doubled the number of confirmed rabies cases in Franklin County this
year, more than all of 2024, and this season is not even close to being over,”
said Scott LaVigne, Franklin County Health Director.   &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Six
of the 10 cases involved skunks, which has been consistent with previous years. Officials said this year has also
included two raccoons, one fox and a bat. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone
that comes into contact with an infected animal or believes they have been
exposed should seek medical attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies
is nearly 100% fatal in humans once you show symptoms of infection, so we
strictly follow the guidelines,” LaVigne said. “Today, a series of four to five shots is
sufficient to prevent rabies in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Pet
owners should also protect their furry loved ones by making sure they are up to
date with their rabies vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“In
nearly every rabies case this year, where domestic animals were exposed, some
pets had never had a rabies shot,” said Jerry Jones, Interim Animal Services
Manager. “That’s a conversation no one wants to have with a family.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
offered tips to best limit pet’s exposure to rabies:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets against rabies and keep the vaccinations current.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pets inside. Supervise pets outside and keep dogs on a leash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed pets outside. Pet food and mulch attract wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed wildlife, feral cats, or feral dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News has a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/avoid-strange-animals-and-other-tips-to-minimize-rabies-risk/17685299/"&gt;guide online&lt;/a&gt; with tips to minimize the risk of rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
advise calling 911 to contact Animal Services if they see any animal showing
rabies symptoms. People should keep a safe distance away from the animal but
watch out for where the animal is until Animal Services Officers arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/franklin-county-tenth-rabies-case-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dogs
and cats are required to have an updated rabies vaccination. If a pet is not
vaccinated or is due for a vaccine, pet owners are advised to contact their
veterinarian. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County Animal Shelter is also offering a vaccine event on Saturday, August 23,
from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. The cost for a rabies vaccine is $15. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For
livestock and other pets, owners should contact their veterinarian for rabies
vaccination information and prevention. &lt;/p&gt;

and growing numbers are being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), confirm the wider potential benefits of drug treatment and could help patients decide whether to start medication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Having ADHD means the brain works differently to most other people's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Symptoms can include difficulties concentrating and sitting still, having high energy levels and being impulsive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite the surge in people asking for help, the disorder is not becoming more common. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c720r1pxrx5o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Last year a BBC investigation found long waits for assessment in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People are only diagnosed if the symptoms cause at least a moderate impact on their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most commonly prescribed drugs, called stimulants, help manage everyday symptoms but there has been limited evidence of longer-term benefits for people's behaviour, while well-publicised side-effects, such as headaches, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping, have sparked debate on their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This BMJ study was based on 148,500 people aged six to 64, with ADHD in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some 57% started drug treatment and, of these, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/methylphenidate-adults/side-effects-of-methylphenidate-for-adults/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin)&lt;/a&gt;, was prescribed, to 88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;suicidal behaviour -

diagnose and treat ADHD can lead to self-medication with alcohol or other drugs, poor mental health, injury, and incarceration," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Too many people with undiagnosed ADHD end up in the criminal justice system, where their condition may remain undiagnosed and untreated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ian Maidment, professor in clinical pharmacy at Aston University, said the study "adds to our understanding of the potential benefits of these drugs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he said the

People with ADHD are also disproportionately represented within the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that for many patients, medication can help alleviate hyperactivity, impulsivity and the inattention. But there has been more limited evidence on whether these improvements translate into benefits in everyday life, at a time when the increasing number of people being diagnosed has fuelled a debate about the possibility of “overdiagnosis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The number of prescriptions being issued in England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/11/adhd-prescriptions-in-england-have-risen-by-18-each-year-since-pandemic#:~:text=ADHD%20prescriptions%20in%20England%20have,deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder%20%7C%20The%20Guardian" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest study, which the researchers say is the largest and most rigorous of its kind, used Swedish national registers from 2007 to 2020 to examine the effects of ADHD drug treatment in 148,581 individuals aged six to 64 years with a new diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team used a technique called target trial emulation, which aims to apply the design principles of a clinical trial to existing medical records through the use of strict inclusion criteria, follow-up timeframes and the use of statistical techniques to compensate for the fact that people were not randomly assigned to “treatment” or “placebo” arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Zheng Chang, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and senior author of the research, said: “It’s now considered one of the most rigorous methods for analysing observational data. However, since we don’t have the real randomisation data it is not bias-proof.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among people with recurrent events, there were statistically significant reductions linked to all five outcomes, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj-2024-083658" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the paper in the British Medical Journal reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When clinicians discuss the possible use of medication with families, oftentimes there is not a focus on what are the risks if you don’t treat,” said Cortese. “If left untreated, there will be unfortunately some risk. Now we have evidence that medication can reduce this risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Adam Guastella, of the Children’s Hospital Westmead Clinical School at the University of Sydney, said: “Such benefits have been shown repeatedly in previous studies, but the large sample size, use of a national registry, and more sophisticated analysis give greater confidence in these results that findings aren’t explained by something else other than medication use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People should know that if ADHD medications work for them and their child, that there will likely be many other positive impacts on life from treatment. Such effects will not work for everyone and there is still a need to understand why many individuals benefit from ADHD medication and some do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPRi02SXgwYTl0aE8ydDdTMUMtMHhtV0EzZDJZOVBFQVhrdklOUDdfb09lTWdFamRoUHpBdFhrR1NFZjJaRHJxbVpCcHhoQjJvQlFZeEZzVEVSTmRBYWJHZGhPVXJfSVh2bmt6X0xIUWlDRXNTRkF3NkRHMEVsOHNZOWphcFhhblc0WlRmVFVZNlJGZjI3aWpfQUI4amRXMmZzRFNfaFlVZE90VGtmYTB4MkR5cFAzRmpDbVhqcV9oaw</guid></item><item><title>美国国立卫生研究院以缺乏公众信任为由取消mRNA疫苗合同- The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNVHpIUU1zZG1YVHpvdF9pcGZOT0MwU0RRWmVmdzJFMG1jZEhlMTRmeVcwOEZTQXFwYW1RSklaNS1rOHE5ZDV6bnBNYm8wOEtUNm5hblF2cTA2dl9ockx1Zy1GZnhHZVk5UU9nUGxvTlpZSmFOekV0Nl9xMmZrMnRnUUNmaWVIZ9IBiwFBVV95cUxPeXlCdnRhNXNJNFViODg2NHY4WHEyUjRXZHgzTUZwQnAyNGkzdlgyXzllbzh2b1RaQU52bnN6c2ZRY2VXa09JSHpLS09IdmxTNjlzM2RDX0tiNXpLdWY2YXlHZTBKMC1HR21ic3JFOU1yQ2lncjR6aVgyV3F6dHR2cW5RTmRnSnRwNDkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests vegetarians have a 12% lower overall cancer risk compared to those who eat meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegans saw the greatest benefit, with up to a 24% lower cancer risk overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest reductions were seen in stomach, lymphoma and colorectal cancers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetarian diets, unlike typical Western diets, generally tend to be packed with fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes—all foods loaded with compounds that may help reduce cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the connection between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian diets and cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains a topic of debate, research on less common cancers is still limited, even in large studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored whether vegetarian diets might offer protection against a wider range of cancer types, not just the more common ones. The study tests the idea that vegetarian diets, compared to nonvegetarian diets, could show &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-to-prevent-cancer-11758515" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protective benefits for less common cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and the results were published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was conducted using data from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort, which enrolled participants across the United States and Canada between 2002 and 2007. The participants were volunteer members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in North America. Many Seventh-day Adventist members follow a vegetarian or plant-based diet, allowing for a large subject pool of people who follow those dietary patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 95,863 participants were part of the study. After excluding participants with preexisting cancers, extreme or unreliable BMI or dietary data, missing demographic information and those living outside areas covered by cancer registries, the final analytic group included 79,468 participants. Enrollment involved completing a detailed questionnaire by mail, which included a validated food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits over the previous year. Researchers further validated the data through 24-hour dietary recalls conducted by phone in a subgroup of 1,100 participants and by examining dietary biomarkers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were categorized into five dietary groups based on their eating habits: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegans, who avoided all animal products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lacto-ovo-vegetarians, who consumed dairy and/or eggs but no meat or fish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7677248/pescatarian-diet-plan/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pesco-vegetarians&lt;/a&gt;, who included fish in their diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-vegetarians, who ate meat or fish less than once a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonvegetarians, who consumed meat or fish at least once a week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the purposes of this study, vegetarians were defined as those in the first three categories, while semi-vegetarians were excluded from the main analysis due to their small numbers and unclear classification. Cancer cases were identified by matching participant data with cancer registries across the United States and Canada.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To ensure the results were as accurate as possible, the study adjusted for various factors that could influence cancer risk, like age, gender and race. For each cancer type, the study included adjustments for relevant risk factors based on existing research and guidelines, ensuring a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between dietary patterns and cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that vegetarians generally had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study-11682870" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to nonvegetarians, with the exception of a possible slight increase in risk for myeloma. Overall, vegetarians had a 12% lower risk of developing any type of cancer and an 18% lower risk for medium-frequency cancers, such as melanoma, thyroid and pancreatic cancers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For specific cancer types, vegetarians showed significantly lower risks in several areas: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stomach cancer risk was reduced by 45%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lymphoma risk was reduced by 25% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lymphoproliferative cancers risk overall were reduced by 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorectal cancer risk was reduced by 21%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings suggest that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian diets may offer protective benefits&lt;/a&gt; against certain types of cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For all cancers combined, vegans had the lowest risk, with a 24% reduction, followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians with a 9% reduction and pesco-vegetarians with an 11% reduction. For medium-frequency cancers, vegans again had the lowest risk, with a 23% reduction, followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians with an 18% reduction and pesco-vegetarians with a 13% reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For specific cancers, younger vegans (age 65) had a 43% lower risk of prostate cancer, but this protective effect was not seen in older vegans (age 85). Younger vegans also had a 31% lower risk of breast cancer, while older vegans showed a similar trend, though the results were less precise. For lymphomas, older vegans had a 56% lower risk, while younger vegans showed no significant difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some limitations to consider. One major challenge is the small number of less common cancers, especially among vegans and pesco-vegetarians, which makes it harder to draw strong conclusions. Another limitation is that the nonvegetarian group in this study consists of health-conscious people who already eat less meat than the general population, making it harder to see big differences between groups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study only measured participants’ diets and other factors at the beginning and didn’t track changes over time. Lastly, like all observational studies, there’s always the possibility that other unmeasured factors could influence the results, making it hard to apply these findings to the general population. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on this current study, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; can be a practical and potentially powerful way to support your health and lower your risk of certain cancers. While you don’t have to go fully vegan to see benefits, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17189/why-a-vegetarian-diet-is-good-for-your-health-and-the-health-of-the-planet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;adopting more vegetarian habits&lt;/a&gt; into your diet may make a difference when it comes to cancer risk reduction.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat more plants but aren’t sure where to start, here are some simple, practical tips to help you get going:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small&lt;/strong&gt;: Try one meatless meal a week, like “Meatless Monday.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Plants the Star&lt;/strong&gt;: Build your plate around vegetables, beans or whole grains instead of meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;: Try plant-based versions of your favorite dishes, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252610/szechuan-tofu-green-bean-stir-fry/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;veggie stir-fry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7917086/quick-walnut-tacos/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walnut tacos&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Up&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep frozen veggies, canned beans and whole grains on hand for quick, easy meals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Try plant-based proteins like tofu, tempeh or chickpeas in place of meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the potential health benefits of vegan and vegetarian diets, particularly their association with a lower risk of certain cancers. By analyzing data from over 79,000 participants in the Adventist Health Study-2, researchers found that vegetarians, especially vegans, had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-start-now-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11748558" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduced risk of cancers like colorectal&lt;/a&gt;, stomach and lymphoma compared to nonvegetarians.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study has its limitations, such as small sample sizes for less common cancers and the observational nature of the research, the findings suggest that incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet could be a meaningful step toward better health.&lt;br&gt;

To do so, he asked ChatGPT for an alternative to salt, or sodium chloride, to which the AI chatbot suggested sodium bromide, a compound historically used in pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the journal noted that doctors were unable to review the original AI chat logs and that the bot likely suggested the substitution for another purpose, such as cleaning, the man purchased sodium bromide and used it in place of table salt for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, he ended up in the ER with paranoid delusions, despite having no history of mental health problems. Convinced that his neighbor was poisoning him, the man was reluctant to even accept water from the hospital, despite reporting extreme thirst. He continued to experience increased paranoia, as well as auditory and visual hallucinations, eventually landing him an involuntary psychiatric hold after he tried to escape during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What was happening to the man?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors determined that the man was suffering from bromide toxicity (or bromism), which can result in neurological and psychiatric symptoms, as well as others experienced by the man, including acne and cherry angiomas (bumps on the skin), fatigue, insomnia, subtle ataxia (clumsiness) and polydipsia (excessive thirst).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other symptoms of bromism can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, tremors or seizures, drowsiness, headache, weakness, weight loss, kidney damage, respiratory failure and coma, according to &lt;a href="https://www.icliniq.com/articles/vitamins-and-minerals/bromide-toxicity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iCliniq;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;iCliniq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bromism was once far more common due to bromide salts having been used in everyday products. In the early 20th Century, it was used in over-the-counter medications, often resulting in neuropsychiatric and dermatological symptoms, according to the study's authors. Incidents of such poisoning saw a sharp decline when the Food and Drug Administration phased out the use of bromides in pharmaceuticals between the mid 70s and late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The man was treated at the hospital for three weeks, over which time his symptoms progressively improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man landed in the hospital after taking dietary advice from ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;USA TODAY reached out to OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, for comment on Wednesday, Aug. 13, but has not received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The company&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:provided Fox News D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; provided Fox News D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:i;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gital&lt;/a&gt; with a statement, saying, "Our terms say that ChatGPT is not intended for use in the treatment of any health condition, and is not a substitute for professional advice.

While the study's authors noted that they couldn't know exactly what the man was told without the original chat log, they did receive a suggestion for bromide as a replacement for chloride in their tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a speciﬁc health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," said study authors Dr. Audrey Eichenberger, Dr. Stephen Thielke and Dr. Adam Van Buskirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;AI carries the risk of providing information like this without context, according to the doctors. For example, it is unlikely that a medical expert would have mentioned sodium bromide at all if a patient asked for a salt substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Thus, it is important to consider that ChatGPT and other AI systems can generate scientiﬁc inaccuracies, lack the ability to critically discuss results, and ultimately fuel the spread of misinformation," according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/13/man-hospitalized-chat-gpt-diet-advice/85646650007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Man hospitalized after taking ChatGPT diet advice, study says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Man hospitalized after taking ChatGPT diet advice, study says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:12:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1NRWpwZWw5OExlbzdMek5McVVPdHMzaWF4ZzJRZHZiaEM3YXVkeDBoMEhJSGZvaDhJRVJpYTdCTGV1enBFTkJ2aXNReEFOOU1KMU0yQXdQX0Rud3RrR0wxT1I2Y3paNHU5WVRKNUVRUWxDZGZhZXdyOQ</guid></item><item><title>在密苏里州证实可能与滑水有关的罕见脑食变形虫感染- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQV0FpSmlZOGZkQm9ESFFVTUpFWjI0bjdEUWY1MXVHbG04MEg5QU5BbklJMWdXbTBTbmY2NnlRYnVqVllhaWU4cDZHV2NFYUlVYmotQktENFhtTFVNOGVQWUdpbDIySi1QSWRYUE5ONklyYmR3dnRxVmxVU3ZUeUQtVTlTNWRfa2hGUFoxMNIBkgFBVV95cUxPdEkzRkNuMWhveWlQT1pkOGxyOE82cUtpZk11MFJBaW5CT19UMFdQaUliRTljUS15dVJ4WjFuYVZfcks1NGYzTjBaOV91aWlOQkVqZHRGa1JUQzN2NGpSWHhpcWNpaEZKQTJQNGFsMW9pQ2M2TUx3QUlhSHZSeHlBeGo4UF8tenZXTnZieHhHR3hMUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person in Missouri has been hospitalized after contracting a brain-eating amoeba, possibly after water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks, state health officials said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who was not identified, is being treated in an intensive care unit for a confirmed Naegleria fowleri amoeba infection, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said. Public health officials are still investigating the source of the infection, but the health department said the patient became ill days after they were at the lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two public beaches open to visitors at the Lake of the Ozarks State Park, according to the park's website. The health department did not specify which beach the patient had gone to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Naegleria fowleri organism is common in warm freshwater, the infection — called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM — is rare, health officials say. It occurs when water is forced up the nose and is able to cross into the brain, which can happen during &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;recreational freshwater activities&lt;/a&gt;, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1962 and 2024, there have been 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.&lt;/p&gt;

The South Carolina Department of Public Health said it was the first known case in the state since 2016. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jaysen-carr-south-carolina-brain-eating-amoeba-awareness/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Jaysen Carr's family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later spoke publicly about their son's death, saying they "do not want this to happen to anyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of infection, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; suggests holding your nose or wearing a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into freshwater or keeping your head above water in hot springs. Signs of infection include nausea, vomiting, fever, a severe headache, stiff neck, seizures, altered mental state and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing contaminated water or from someone else who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;

The test results were discovered on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials warn that rabies is a "deadly disease caused by a virus that can infect all warm-blooded animals, including people." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is spread mostly by wild animals, but unvaccinated cats and dogs may also become infected and spread the virus," officials said. "The rabies virus lives in the saliva and brain tissue of infected animals. Rabies can be spread by scratches from infected animals or when infected saliva comes into contact with open wounds, breaks in the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.)." &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterford Animal Control offers the following tips to avoid rabies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refrain from feeding or approaching any wild or stray animals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on their rabies vaccines &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit your pets unsupervised time outside &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information and questions, contact Ledge Light at the Health District at 860-448-4882, or Waterford Animal Control at 860-442-9451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPa3hSekR3TWM3dzV2dGktZ04wUmlxa1JaeGtLQlNpY1JrZWd1RmN5ZzFOYUxEaWdWd1ZuNVpPeFFjZEJpN3J5c0FmY3hlZGVoLUM5TEs3cklZSDllc2Y4N3pEWWNSbVc5TUFQSDQzeml5NDVzUkFYV0lYTTk3aDhTdEhEb2V0eDZZdzhrM2tqRVlhUjVxbEHSAbABQVVfeXFMTUdJRUtVcFpTclNwVjlYSVRMLUZoN1c2WExpb0pjVXhXZ3RSM1RqQVhiVTdTQ085LWhMWVU5TERsT2xlLWN5NXAwWldnQkthZWpDM05Qd2tmVWRkX0haUlp0c1pxSy0yT0drWmlPQzJNbGJ3cmtqNEhEMW01Y29tRlp2TU1VcXBUSnVDRXNXNnNLczNnRjdDeFhkU2J4ZVFWMVZ6MnliQUx4a1h1VlQ4bkc</guid></item><item><title>为什么科罗拉多兔子会长出触手和角？ -《丹佛邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9JQ0h0THFjOFZ1bjNTak5UQ1BKQWZzY1RYMzkxTFBsVUN5em5uOUlSRzlSZHNKWG5WTG9GNE4xWVNpaGZCdVdsdjRhMkRobHdodkpNN0RKMGFTMDJQSF9waVhldnoxR09Menl5TFJfdUhoLU9kVDkzMkJWWdIBgAFBVV95cUxPY19kZ042ZHBfQXc1NEhfWGJsT2piZWRVN2ZEQ241eklKTm9WR0ViRWxwVS1WLXh2bU9SZ2puVTJvVl93YWlDM2EwU1NXcWo4QmduZ3FiM25YRFJBVXl5SldEeWZCWVhKZnZtOGtXUmw2ZE8zdmQyUFVIQkV6M2Uzeg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbits with tentacles in northern Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s not really a better way to sum up recent photos and headlines about &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/science/frankenstein-bunnies-with-head-spikes-invade-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cottontail rabbits spotted around Fort Collins&lt;/a&gt; with long, dangling growths on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as concerning as they appear, the virus that causes the dark, wart-like growths is relatively common and usually not anything to worry about, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/tag/colorado-parks-and-wildlife/"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths are caused by &lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/diseases-of-research-animals-dora/rabbits/rabbit-shope-papilloma-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rabbit or shope papilloma virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is spread between cottontail rabbits through direct contact or biting insects such as fleas and ticks, Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shope papilloma virus can’t spread to humans or other pets, although both should avoid rabbits and other wildlife, Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials have received a handful of reports of the virus since &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Denver’s 9News&lt;/a&gt; published a photo and story of the odd virus last week, which spread to dozens of other local, national and international news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waxy papillomas are mostly made up of keratin and don’t have any negative impact on rabbits unless they interfere with their ability to eat or drink, and most rabbits recover from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbit papilloma virus can spread to pet rabbits and is more severe in domestic breeds, so pet owners should seek veterinary treatment if their animal gets sick, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is found in cottontail rabbits, especially during summer months, when there is higher rabbit density and insect activity. While CPW has received around a dozen reports of sightings over the last week, Van Hoose speculates that there probably aren’t that many cases of SPV, but rather, many people are likely seeing the same group of infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no risk of virus transmission to humans or other animals, though the CPW recommends that humans and pets should still stay away from and not interact with infected rabbits if they cross paths. However, the CPW also notes that domestic rabbits, if they are housed outside, could contract the virus from infected insects or rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottontail rabbit with SPV growths, photographed in Minnesota.

A person may be able to spot if this is a problem if they notice the rabbit doesn’t seem able to hop properly, Lindstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you find a dead rabbit on your property, regardless of whether it is visibly infected or not, Lindstrom notes that it is safe to wear gloves and handle the animal yourself if you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:08:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxNend2NnQ0T01GR0JETHNOSDA3Z1dHZUdFa0kxdUVpM2M5UWdxeGF5cG5SaFVPSUYwM1gtek5WOG54OGx5b1dfYVBzOUpubXFPY1dCQmRGaG1yUFRNSy1RaEdBdEhHOU5ua04zaEJsX2FnZXpuTzFTVDdYRUlCMHQ3TEo1UWM2ZDMxZWFqNG0xOXYyT2dzV192cnlJYWxRY2czWmhQYWZRV08tOURIQVpiWEI5ZDFEWVRYQlM1amZES0pYOVBhZ3dsT2FGY096SjNBOHp0Z0dWSUJxQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子说，医生驳回了他患有食管癌的1个迹象- TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNW5XWTBsOXlJR09Edkp0ckRmYnNiNXB2eVdiUmxZRW5mSndlTHpybDU4cHludURQclJfallkaEpCd2dzQnc3d3dTU1JvT09SNGRfX3pBNGZqM0J0OFJsdWlUYm1ua0lSTEZCRURhVWFrYndkYmwxRjdMOHl4aFlRS2o4WVpLSFVfaWfSAVRBVV95cUxQSE1IZ3FQank1cHgzYVpJd21HMEZtcC1KZEpJcE9uQTFnVkh2LWZ2TFcwdTMwQjBGZlQzTzVCVHZkaHU2Q3ZIT0h5d0I5NlY1dHhvbWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84b3b6" class="body-graf"&gt;After three stressful years, Mark Sevillano Jr. felt like his life was falling into place. At the start of 2024, he began working out at the gym three days a week and eating healthier foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d628b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt better and just when I started feeling better, I … couldn’t really swallow my food comfortably,” the 41-year-old from Santa Fe Springs, California, tells TODAY.com. “I felt like it almost would get stuck in my throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-224efc" class="body-graf"&gt;He’d “chug” water, and that often helped the food move through his esophagus. After two months, his symptoms worsened, and he visited a doctor, who reluctantly ordered a swallow test for Sevillano. Before he could undergo the exam, he visited the emergency room, where he learned he had esophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8096b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have never imagined that I had any cancer, let alone esophageal cancer,” he says. “I’ve never even said the word esophagus. It was not on my radar at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5eed91" class="body-heading"&gt;Transformation Leads to Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c242c" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2021, Sevillano's 11-year marriage ended in divorce, and the dad of two was stressed. At the same time, he was in college completing his teaching degree. By 2024, he had graduated from college and finally began to feel settled as he regularly attended the gym, ate healthy foods and ran a few 5Ks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d472f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“'I’m healing,'” he recalls thinking. “I was losing a little bit of weight, but I thought it was because of my new lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-013643" class="body-graf"&gt;Soon after, his swallowing problems began. At first, drinking a lot of water helped. But after two months, swallowing became even more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79db28" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have to literally pound my chest with my fist to help break down the pathway to allow my food to go down,” Sevillano explains. “That was so odd now that I think back on it. But at the time I thought, ‘Oh, I need a little extra help to digest my food.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-3226a1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2198"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

But his primary care doctor “didn’t sound too concerned” because Sevillano was young and there was no family history of cancer. Still, Sevillano asked for a swallow test — which his mother, who is a nurse — told him to request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f197f" class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘We’ll schedule a swallow test in the future. I’m not too worried about it,’” Sevillano recalls. “Looking back on it, I was like, ‘Wow, there are so many red flags.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478db3" class="body-graf"&gt;He scheduled the appointment for several months later. But his swallowing “got progressively worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32444d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I couldn’t even swallow liquid anymore,” he says. “It would sit in my throat, almost like a drain that is clogged up, and it’s filling up with water. You need to unplug the drain. It felt like that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b66a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano visited the emergency room and, at first, the doctors were “perplexed” by his swallowing difficulties. But they conducted bloodwork and even had him undergo a CT scan. At about 4 a.m., his blood test results returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384f1b" class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) said, ‘Hey, to let you know your bloodwork came back great and the next thing we’re waiting on is your scan, and I’m sure that’s going to come back great as well,’” Sevillano recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98e5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;Less than an hour later, the doctor returned with a grim look on his face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0800c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He said, ‘Unfortunately, we got your scan back and we found a mass in the center of your chest, in your lower part of your esophagus,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24277" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, he didn’t realize doctors sometimes interchangeably use mass and tumor, so he wasn’t too worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If he would have said, ‘You have a tumor,’ I would have freaked out a little more,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e4a6b" class="body-graf"&gt;He stayed in the hospital to undergo tests, including a biopsy. But when doctors attempted it, they struggled to pass the scope through all the inflammation in his throat. Though they tried a smaller scope, the sample they removed wasn’t enough to determine if it was cancerous. Still, they released Sevillano from the hospital, and he ran a 5K two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-399ccd" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano's doctors scheduled a second biopsy. But before that happened, he became very ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-501a5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“(This) is where I almost died,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22fcb5" class="body-graf"&gt;As he waited for the new biopsy and maintained a liquid-only diet, Sevillano became tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf6dd" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body just didn’t feel right,” he says. “I started to feel light-headed, almost as if I’m going to faint.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c647a" class="body-graf"&gt;He rested on the couch and began “convulsing,” and “shaking and shivering.” After he put on a coat and a hat to warm himself up, his mom noticed he was too pale. They returned to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed him with sepsis, a potentially fatal overreaction in the body to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70055a" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body was shutting down and they had to pump me with any type of antibiotics to fight the infection that was rapidly going through my bloodstream,” Sevillano says. “For the next four days, I was fighting and trying to get the infection out of my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6625b5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1708"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

For the most part, chemotherapy caused exhaustion, brain fog and some neuropathy, but after the fourth round, he “started actually vomiting black stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1820a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was still awful,” he says. “I took it like a champ. But I think it could have been worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad08db" class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery took place in October and was intense. Doctors removed six inches of his esophagus, which is about 10 inches long in total, and a strawberry-sized tumor. Doctors used his upper intestine to create a new esophagus connected to his remaining organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-002461" class="body-graf"&gt;“I went in with a smile on my face and said, ‘OK, let’s do this. Let’s take this tumor out,’” Sevillano says. “When I woke up, I had maybe eight tubes in my side, in my face. I was in severe pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-135236" class="body-graf"&gt;After recovering in the hospital for several days and undergoing more tests, Sevillano returned home. About a month later, he underwent one more round of chemotherapy. Doctors recommended that he have another three, but he felt overwhelmed by his prior chemotherapy and treatment and elected to stop. Since his surgery, there has been no evidence of disease. He will undergo regular scans for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fdd406" class="body-graf"&gt;“I had my six-month check-up scan and that came out with no detection of cancer,” he says. “I went to the beach and celebrated six months of being cancer-free.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-be8da9" class="body-heading"&gt;An Increase in GI Cancers in Young People &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a38087" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano is part of a trend of young people being diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers, which include colorectal, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal cancers. These diagnoses are increasing faster than any other type of cancer in adults under 50, according to a review published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2836671" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46c06a" class="body-graf"&gt;While colorectal cancer cases in young people have increased the most, pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancer diagnoses are also on the rise, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gastrointestinal-cancers-are-rising-dramatically-people-50-rcna219104" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The latter three do not have a screening test like colorectal cancer does, making them harder to diagnose early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2730a5" class="body-graf"&gt;While more research is needed, the cause of all gastrointestinal cancer in young adults could be the same.

Much like Sevillano’s doctor dismissed his early concerns about swallowing, many young people find their doctors downplaying their concerns because they’re not considering gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50. That could contribute to diagnosis in later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89df83" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeing is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey, told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c81391" class="body-graf"&gt;Though Ng said it’s possible that GI cancers in younger people “may be biologically different and more aggressive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a02dd2" class="body-heading"&gt;‘My Spirit is Not Broken’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf32" class="body-graf"&gt;After so many months of not being able to eat normally, Sevillano still struggles with getting enough nutrition.

                        &lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — Arizona wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about potential health risks wild coyotes could pose to domestic animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing has confirmed that canine distemper is circulating among coyotes within residential neighborhoods and parks, &lt;a href="https://www.azgfd.com/2025/08/12/canine-distemper-reports-rise-in-maricopa-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illness is a highly contagious viral disease that infects an animal’s respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. While humans aren’t vulnerable to it, the disease can be fatal for both domestic and wild animals, especially canids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tuesday announcement from AZGFD said it has been receiving a rising amount of reports of sick or disoriented coyotes within the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to protect dogs from canine distemper from wild coyotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department urges pet owners to keep their animals up-to-date on their vaccinations. Dogs should also be kept on a leash and kept far away from wild animals, especially if they show red flags of canine distemper, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of fear toward humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appearing sick or disoriented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stumbling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seizures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canine temper can spread from wildlife to domestic animals through direct contact, shared food or water sources and airborne droplets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZGFD urges people to avoid approaching or touching wildlife, refrain from feeding them, supervise pets outdoors and report any sick or dead animals to 623-236-7201.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-news/dog-owners-urged-to-vaccinate-after-valley-sees-distemper-diagnoses/2946916/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Several local nonprofits&lt;/a&gt; operate low-cost clinics that offer distemper vaccines for pets.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention estimates that there are 80,000 yearly cases of the vibriosis in the United States, with 52,000 coming from eating contaminated seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most vibrio infections lead to mild gastroenteritis. Vibrio vulnificus is the variant with the high mortality rate tracked by the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wound and bloodstream infections of vibrio vulnificus have the severe symptoms, with the bacteria killing one in five people who are infected. Those with pre-existing conditions or recent surgeries are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How many vibrio vulnificus deaths, cases this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Aug. 4 incident marks the second death in &lt;a href="/story/news/local/2025/07/31/inspection-report-explains-issues-at-troubled-pcb-marine-park/85422398007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsherald.com/story/news/local/2025/07/31/inspection-report-explains-issues-at-troubled-pcb-marine-park/85422398007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bay County&lt;/a&gt; this year from vibrio vulnificus. It also was the Florida's fifth death related to the bacteria this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;So far in 2025, 16 people have contracted vibrio vulnificus across the state. In just Northwest Florida, there was one case in Okaloosa County, one case in Walton County, and two cases in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How are most cases contracted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When infections do occur, they typically come from eating raw seafood infected with the virus, or entering water with an open wound. Exposing a wound to raw seafood, such as when shucking an oyster, can also cause an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sanitary sewer overflows, leaky septic tanks, heavy rains, and disturbance of underwater sediment are also linked to higher concentrations of vibrio vulnificus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Rising surface water temperatures from climate change also might allow the bacteria to become more prevalent in colder climates. Cases have been found as far north as New York and Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus thrives in water temperatures between 68 and 95, but can grow in temperatures up to 105, according to the FDOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Panama City News Herald</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQRTk1U1BoallqbDBieE5Ob0xhUVYta2JZNHA3MEtmS0JuNFRlM25iNlZYSUZmSTlKNGpWSHJCZkhJMUhnWUM1OG5aeWlIaWEwQ01jeW0tN2RQV1V6Nng1NExZQ092X1Rrc3JnMXFyLTl3NUhJWE5jb1lwSFBQMExkWUVvUzVjdFp4bXdvMGxCbmM3cG4wNW9PQzhLNlF4M2hKSXhNazdFWXBpSzdEcGFjYlptSlltV1dkRi1LQ1lKSGdNUEhKZmdRNzVhUWhCdw</guid></item><item><title>在Ozarks湖之旅后在密苏里州居民中发现的大脑食用变形虫- KSDK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxOemoxRHVVY3M0NXR5ZHNKbGg0QlA1UzVPRk5JUmdhTml6MTM3SnJraDZSMnYzWHlndUltMFI5R0JQN1FzSlRxQkt1aUxfT29ETndsTGpDcW9mN25zM29DUkgtRkhyMVA1RzlLay1VV2F5SXAtRGxxMGMtLWtxT0ItMFBvaFFFMlZIVk1Jd1k1cmx0d0FESkl4aTQzZlVBcHY1ekFRNUt6TGdubTV5aUhIQm5URC1aUzZVRFN2YXQxNFlPUXdRUHR1dTM2S3RUakNoaWo2ZmFWdFBsNm5SNTdva3B6aFFOWC1Ea0dQTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The deadly infection has been historically rare, but as climate change heats up waters and worsens flooding, research shows cases could become more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — A Missouri resident is in intensive care after officials confirmed they had contracted a rare and deadly infection after swimming at the Lake of the Ozarks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

The amoeba can cause a deadly infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is naturally present in warm freshwater and is often found during the summer months, but human infection has historically been extremely rare, health department officials said. There have only been 167 reported cases of the infection in the United States between 1962 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time a Naegleria fowleri infection was &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/ea19a071-5c03-495c-9b62-69db69078d4e/missouri-dhss-confirms-case-of-rare-brain-infection#:~:text=Naegleria%2520fowleri%2520is%2520a%2520microscopic,care%2520unit%2520of%2520a%2520hospital." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;confirmed in Missouri was in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The only other confirmed case in the state was in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The source of the patient’s exposure is currently being investigated by public health officials," officials said. "While not confirmed, preliminary information implies the patient may have been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days prior to becoming ill. Recreational water users should assume that &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is present in warm freshwater across the United States; however, infection remains very rare."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other suspected cases of PAM are being investigated in Missouri at this time, according to the department. 5 On Your Side reached out to the Centers for Disease Control for additional comment, but it deferred to Missouri health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Naegleria fowleri infections have historically been rare, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; warns that warming temperatures and increasingly frequent floods caused by human-induced climate change are making infections occur more often.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, which is outside the livable range of competing microorganisms, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; research published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in the waterways through flooding, creating the perfect storm for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — The local health department has elevated the risk of contracting West Nile virus to “high” after the city recently recorded three cases of the virus, Chicago’s first human cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three patients are between 40 and 80 years old, live on the Northwest or South sides and all contracted symptoms in late July or early August, according to a news release from the Chicago Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads only through infected mosquito bites. One in five people develop fever or flu-like symptoms — but most won’t feel sick, according to the health department. One in 150 infected people over 60 years old get severely ill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a higher proportion of mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus than usual this year,” Chicago Public Health Commissioner Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige said in a statement. “The best way to protect yourself from West Nile virus is to avoid mosquito bites and take measures to stop them from breeding around your home.” &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The health department has sprayed insecticide in nine community areas over the last two weeks and will be back at it Wednesday in Forest Glen, Norwood Park, Mount Greenwood and Beverly. On Thursday, it will spray insecticide in East Garfield Park, Near West Side and North Lawndale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spraying — done from trucks — begins at dusk and runs through 1 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health department recommends Chicagoans take caution with Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellant, trimming grass and weeds and dumping away standing water in their yards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chicagoans should also check screens, windows and doors for holes and wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. People who are immunocompromised should consider staying indoors. &lt;/p&gt;

The company was developing an RNAi-based therapeutic for H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu. RNAi is short for RNA interference and refers to small pieces of RNA that can shut down the production of specific proteins. The approach has been well studied, and several RNAi-based drugs are on the market. The first was approved in 2018 to treat nerve damage caused by a rare disease called hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The contract cancellation came as a surprise to Tiba, which received a stop-work order on August 5 that did not reference the wind-down of BARDA’s mRNA vaccine development activities. “Our project does not involve the development of an mRNA product and is a therapeutic rather than a vaccine,” said Jasdave Chahal, Tiba’s chief scientific officer, via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Government contracts often include specific milestones that contractors must achieve to receive funding and move forward with their projects. Tiba says its project had met its goals so far and was near completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Also among the canceled contracts was a $750,000 award to Emory University to convert an mRNA-based antiviral treatment for flu and Covid into an inhaled, dry powder formulation. The project did not involve the development of a vaccine. “Unfortunately, we don’t have much insight to offer on the grant cancellation,” Emory spokesperson Brian Katzowitz told WIRED in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The cuts are consistent with Kennedy’s desire to deprioritize research into infectious diseases, although &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493544/rfk-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;experts have warned&lt;/a&gt; that the cuts could leave the US more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Despite its scaling down of RNA-related infectious disease research, the administration has expressed enthusiasm about some non-Covid research involving mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In January, shortly after taking office, President Trump announced a joint venture by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank called Stargate to invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure. At the time, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison talked up the potential for AI to make personalized mRNA-based vaccines for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In an &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/"}' href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;August 12 op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in The Washington Post, National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya acknowledged the promise of mRNA. “I do not dispute its potential. In the future, it may yet deliver breakthroughs in treating diseases such as cancer, and HHS is continuing to invest in ongoing research on applications in oncology and other complex diseases,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Unlike his boss, Bhattacharya says he does not believe the mRNA vaccines have caused mass harm. But he says the reason for stopping mRNA vaccine research is because the platform has lost public trust—a rationale that deviates from Kennedy’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Yet mRNA may be more accepted when it comes to treating very sick patients with genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Earlier this year, regulators at the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-baby-received-a-custom-crispr-treatment-in-record-time/"&gt;greenlit a customized gene-editing treatment&lt;/a&gt; for an infant named KJ Muldoon with a rare and life-threatening liver disease. Created in just six months, it uses mRNA to deliver the gene-editing components to his liver. It was the first time a customized gene-editing treatment was used to successfully treat a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In June, FDA commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/interactive-and-social-media/fda-direct-podcast"&gt;praised the achievement&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a data-offer-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967"}' href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;his podcast&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “kind of a big win for medical science,” and at an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/workshops-meetings-conferences-biologics/cell-and-gene-therapy-roundtable-06052025"&gt;FDA roundtable&lt;/a&gt; Makary said the agency will continue to facilitate the regulatory process for these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers behind the custom gene-editing treatment plan to use the same approach for more patients and recently met with the FDA about a clinical trial proposal. “The FDA was very positive about the proposal and effectively gave us the green light to proceed with our work,” says Kiran Musunuru, professor for translational research at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team has another meeting with the FDA in a month or two to discuss extending the platform concept beyond a single disease or single gene to a broader group of disorders. “We’ll see how that goes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:07:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPMTdYTE84RFRvcUtKamNmZWhlM1AtWGFQM3k1MFZLMkNybkVILVRIUVZodXFXSGc3VXlGZkJCYXZGdVNkak5FcnV4UjVVTG41RU4yZHRQMDlTXzVCcGxMZVdLT3gxMHppRFVoTWNlSGdKMjZsdEQzOXA3dUVxZ2NLdmFwNi16UGRKV1ZzREpn</guid></item><item><title>并非所有超加工食品都对您有害...研究揭示了实际上使您更健康的八种食物-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-small"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Daily Mail journalists select and curate the products that feature on our site.

They undergo multiple rounds of manufacturing, with factories infusing cheeses, cured meat, potato chips and more with additives that would never be found in the average household kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-056570a0-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report recently revealed that Americans get &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14977481/americans-half-diet-cancer-causing-foods-report.html"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their daily calories on average from highly processed foods. Kids and teens got about two-thirds of their calories from these foods from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF-heavy diets have been linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;a laundry list of maladies&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-05665b01-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05665b00-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined in April that for every 10 percent more ultra-processed food added to a person's diet, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14655757/researchers-reveal-number-americans-killed-ultraprocessed-foods-us.html"&gt;risk of dying early&lt;/a&gt; from any cause jumped by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They further found that one in seven of nearly 1 million premature deaths in the US could be tied directly to ultra-processed foods like meats, candy, ice cream, and even some seemingly healthy salads and breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are the same. Some UPFs, like frozen veggies, canned tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and Greek yogurt, are healthy swaps because their processing, including freezing and canning, preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part of the appeal of UPFs is their accessibility. They are generally cheaper than unprocessed chicken, fresh fruit, and organic vegetables. They help families keep their grocery costs down and get dinner on the table quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts argue that families do not have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for convenience. Canned low-sodium beans, frozen vegetables, and breads with a short ingredients label can be swapped out for some less-than-healthy pantry and freezer staples packed with sodium and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Foods like pepperoni, chicken nuggets, syrup-packed canned fruit, frozen dinners, candy, store-bought breads, chips, and ice cream are classic ‘red flag’ ultra-processed foods—packed with additives, excess sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPFs are difficult to avoid in the average American grocery store. They make up about 70 percent of the inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a study out last week: ‘Most of the foods containing industrial additives are also high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although the additives are part of the issue, the main problem is that children and adults in the United States eat excessive amounts of nutritionally poor UPFs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term ‘ultra-processed foods’ is an umbrella term that encompasses those items that have been pumped with preservatives, artificial colors, filler ingredients, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, not all UPFs are harmful,’ the AHA added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads are of better diet quality, have been associated with improved health outcomes, and are affordable, allowing possible inclusion in diets.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being ultra-processed, some of the best swaps for what most would consider 'junk food' contain fewer additives, including preservatives and colors, less added sugar, and lower sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen veggies and berries, canned tomatoes, whole grain bread, and unsweetened Greek yogurt all qualify as processed foods because they undergo innocuous, and in some cases beneficial, processes. These include flash-freezing, canning, mechanical straining in the case of yogurt, and enrichment with vitamins in whole grain bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-7eaeb250-786a-11f0-ad6d-4bfd60e95792"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freezing vegetables preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45vFm1t"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain low-sugar yogurts have been associated with improved health outcomes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45Nnoc5"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UPFs typically have long ingredients list including hard-to-pronounce chemicals, artificial colors, and added sugars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows percentages of calories consumed from ultra-processed foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, most UPFs on store shelves also contain more saturated fat, sodium, and sugar, all red flag ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cured and processed meats such as pepperoni and chicken nuggets, canned fruits in syrup, frozen meals, candies and some breads, potato chips, ice cream, and more, are examples of ‘red flag’ foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options,’ the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists recommend people swap out red flag foods with UPFs that include beneficial ingredients like whole grains, beans, yogurt, or nuts, as well as fortified cereals, whole-grain breads, or plain yogurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have been linked to better heart health compared to UPFs loaded with synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grain breads are full of fiber that reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.

said: 'Binge gaming may signify an initial phase in the progression of IDG and other severe social, physical and mental health issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added other risk factors may lead to the development of the disorder like attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study has revealed binge gaming is linked to poor mental health in children and teens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, the latest government figures show 91 per cent of children and young people between three and 15 years old play video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gaming disorder has even been labeled as a health condition by the World Health Organization (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, a study found that teens who spend more than two hours a day scrolling on phones or tablets doubled their risk of developing anxiety and quadrupled their chances of becoming depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged screen time, particularly passively scrolling or ‘doomscrolling’, led to heightened anxiety, depression, aggression and impulsiveness among adolescents who took part in a nine-month study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroscientists said 45 per cent of the 12 to 17-year-olds they studied, who had no prior mental health conditions, experienced psychiatric symptoms that needed further medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research comes amid a growing mental health crisis in Britain’s schools, with NHS data showing more than a fifth of eight to 16-year-olds had a probable mental health problem in 2023, a rise of 7 per cent since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13972829/video-games-better-workout-mind-exercise-research-shows.html"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have found that video gaming can have benefits—with one claiming it can be a better workout for the mind than physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, researchers found gamers scored better on memory, attention and reasoning compared to those who did not play video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged screen time led to heightened anxiety (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile moderate-level exercise of 150 minutes per week, in line with NHS guidelines, didn't boost memory and thinking skills, despite improving memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13757513/Playing-video-games-BENEFITS-mental-health.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;with 97,000 participants found the often misunderstood hobby, gaming, had a positive impact on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Japanese researchers revealed owning a game console and playing games helped participants improve their wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, participants who played video games for over three hours a day did not enjoy the same benefits, which suggests the problem may lie in binge gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in one study, researchers found those who played video games for three or more benefits a day performed better in cognitive and memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They undergo multiple rounds of manufacturing, with factories infusing cheeses, cured meat, potato chips and more with additives that would never be found in the average household kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-056570a0-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report recently revealed that Americans get &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14977481/americans-half-diet-cancer-causing-foods-report.html"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their daily calories on average from highly processed foods. Kids and teens got about two-thirds of their calories from these foods from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF-heavy diets have been linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;a laundry list of maladies&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-05665b01-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05665b00-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined in April that for every 10 percent more ultra-processed food added to a person's diet, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14655757/researchers-reveal-number-americans-killed-ultraprocessed-foods-us.html"&gt;risk of dying early&lt;/a&gt; from any cause jumped by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They further found that one in seven of nearly 1 million premature deaths in the US could be tied directly to ultra-processed foods like meats, candy, ice cream, and even some seemingly healthy salads and breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are the same. Some UPFs, like frozen veggies, canned tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and Greek yogurt, are healthy swaps because their processing, including freezing and canning, preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part of the appeal of UPFs is their accessibility. They are generally cheaper than unprocessed chicken, fresh fruit, and organic vegetables. They help families keep their grocery costs down and get dinner on the table quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts argue that families do not have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for convenience. Canned low-sodium beans, frozen vegetables, and breads with a short ingredients label can be swapped out for some less-than-healthy pantry and freezer staples packed with sodium and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Foods like pepperoni, chicken nuggets, syrup-packed canned fruit, frozen dinners, candy, store-bought breads, chips, and ice cream are classic ‘red flag’ ultra-processed foods—packed with additives, excess sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPFs are difficult to avoid in the average American grocery store. They make up about 70 percent of the inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a study out last week: ‘Most of the foods containing industrial additives are also high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although the additives are part of the issue, the main problem is that children and adults in the United States eat excessive amounts of nutritionally poor UPFs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term ‘ultra-processed foods’ is an umbrella term that encompasses those items that have been pumped with preservatives, artificial colors, filler ingredients, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, not all UPFs are harmful,’ the AHA added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads are of better diet quality, have been associated with improved health outcomes, and are affordable, allowing possible inclusion in diets.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being ultra-processed, some of the best swaps for what most would consider 'junk food' contain fewer additives, including preservatives and colors, less added sugar, and lower sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen veggies and berries, canned tomatoes, whole grain bread, and unsweetened Greek yogurt all qualify as processed foods because they undergo innocuous, and in some cases beneficial, processes. These include flash-freezing, canning, mechanical straining in the case of yogurt, and enrichment with vitamins in whole grain bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-7eaeb250-786a-11f0-ad6d-4bfd60e95792"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freezing vegetables preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45vFm1t"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain low-sugar yogurts have been associated with improved health outcomes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45Nnoc5"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UPFs typically have long ingredients list including hard-to-pronounce chemicals, artificial colors, and added sugars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows percentages of calories consumed from ultra-processed foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, most UPFs on store shelves also contain more saturated fat, sodium, and sugar, all red flag ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cured and processed meats such as pepperoni and chicken nuggets, canned fruits in syrup, frozen meals, candies and some breads, potato chips, ice cream, and more, are examples of ‘red flag’ foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options,’ the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists recommend people swap out red flag foods with UPFs that include beneficial ingredients like whole grains, beans, yogurt, or nuts, as well as fortified cereals, whole-grain breads, or plain yogurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have been linked to better heart health compared to UPFs loaded with synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grain breads are full of fiber that reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Beans and nuts serve as the ideal protein-packed snacks, and unsweetened yogurt balances the body’s gut microbiome and improves overall gastrointestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grace Derocha, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.realsimple.com/ultra-processed-foods-that-are-actually-healthy-11788918"&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The science recognizes the complexity—UPF is a broad category, and context matters.
