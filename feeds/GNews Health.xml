    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga33wa000x26qk2ln65ozc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga36es00003b6q0q3zz96x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00063b6qoxtsjogv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00073b6qy4l2my4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00083b6qgd1j2wq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1,700 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" target="_blank"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00093b6qr7dihq3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/#:~:text=Measles%20has%20been%20officially%20%E2%80%9Celiminated,in%20any%20year%20since%201992." target="_blank"&gt;elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000a3b6qlaa7utcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000b3b6qwtafrmxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiga3vog000d3b6q2gr86dbd@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="schools-and-small-brush-fires" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Schools and ‘small brush fires’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3jso00043b6qckj4phgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000i3b6qbawnqgp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000j3b6qlzs1dz9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000k3b6q61dm2560@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000l3b6qpzhz0kxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000m3b6qhxyk6e7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000n3b6qsruyqipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000o3b6qqzud3coy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to &lt;a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/features/your_health/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccine-requirements-worry-public-health-experts-in-south-carolina/article_86dc5de0-926f-11e7-93ba-47e9fd2cff5f.html" target="_blank"&gt;data published by The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000p3b6qun5f5de4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000q3b6q9193chwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga468r000g3b6q5pf52q9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000x3b6q5pbnc7a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-autism-baseless-new-guidance-website/" target="_blank"&gt;have been ignored by health authorities&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000y3b6qq7ywua7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000z3b6q527u4zv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout 2025, he has made other &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;misleading or unsupported statements&lt;/a&gt;. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100103b6q0pvgj7y9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100113b6qe8w7teoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100123b6q64jecj7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100133b6qttzl3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100143b6qdiyzl3m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100153b6q3knudvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s covid vaccine outreach efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100163b6q0ka46bda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100173b6ql0oy4ya7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100183b6qrf88mi38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/families/schoolhealth/dashboard.php" target="_blank"&gt;MMR vaccine rates have declined&lt;/a&gt; among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2022-02-01/missouri-senate-rejects-governors-pick-for-health-director-over-support-for-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;rejected a public health director&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100193b6qeqfo9dcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001a3b6qhndyynvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for covid vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001b3b6qjen4zuuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001c3b6qpn1lp3r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001d3b6q9j0s60a2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001e3b6quhnp6psb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001f3b6qegm2z0ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

What is the meaning of all this, what is life? Why am I here, given that I haven’t signed a consent form to be alive here and now, so what’s this all about, really?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too was tortured by these deep questions as a young student in philosophy, and used to ponder them standing in front of a cast of Rodin’s statue in the grounds of the Hôtel Biron in Paris. I guess I was looking for something, the meaning of all this. Since then, and after drinking so much coffee that I could flood a city with it, I still haven’t got an answer. And yet, one day, something happened: a breakthrough, or perhaps an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="A bronze statue of a nude man seated, leaning forward, his right elbow placed on his left thigh, with the back of his right hand supporting his chin in a posture of contemplation, surrounded by green hedges and a stone building backdrop" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="ld-image-block" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1440px) 60vw, 880px" srcset="https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=384&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 384w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 640w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=750&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 750w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=828&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 828w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 1080w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 1200w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 1920w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 2048w, https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto 3840w" src="https://images.aeonmedia.co/user_image_upload/4561/insert-vc-thinker-flickr.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;format=auto"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-image-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thinker&lt;/em&gt; in the grounds of the Musée Rodin, Paris. Courtesy &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vorn/389491280/in/photolist-AqfbU-br2wHT-br2w1k-37unXH-Yvo6P4-br2x4g-37ukfr-nC2ove-6wgDm-dvZCz-dvZB4-a2XQze-2yoJP6-dvZxB-dvZwQ-4oM2h4-37z18q-dvZFT-dvZyp-6HYDkV-dvZzk-37uobK-dvZAu-2o6bzdr-37jidn-dvZzZ-7jZFn2-dvZJT-U2aGBW-nuJKkC-fowXJ-dvZKm-V8Nz4Z-2o66vcz-8V4ZjB-dvZwq-dvZzF-dvZyS-dvZBw-aGJntH-dvZKV-dvZJo-dvZGN-4oR5kY-dvZJ2-dvZEM-2o6bz1Y-dvZC8-7E4VTf-f5a1u1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VC/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I went back to &lt;em&gt;The Thinker&lt;/em&gt; as I had so many times when younger: he was still there, still thinking, holding his head as if all those deep, heavy thoughts had transformed his skull to stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for the right angle to take a selfie, a miracle happened: I got hungry. Partly because of the heat, partly because I’d had just one black coffee in the morning, the head of Rodin’s &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt; started tilting and melting, and the massive weight of his &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; became visible to my mind. It was as if the statue was slowly liquefying and transforming into a vegetal living thing, something like a salad, or perhaps a cucumber? Something fresh anyway, something that I could have eaten on the spot. And then some questions popped into my head: did the Thinker like cucumber salad? Where did he grow up? Did he prefer summer or winter? White wine or red? Where was he from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that moment I realised I had got it all wrong. I was so obsessed with his thinking brain that I had ignored his toes – not to mention the rest &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;of him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;rains are highly fashionable. A very common belief is that the human mind and cognition lie in the head, within the confines of a spongy greyish organ called ‘the brain’ encased within skull and skin. While I was looking at that &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt;’s head, with my stomach protesting, I realised I had completely dismissed his body. I was obsessed with understanding his mind, and my mind via his brain, but I completely ignored the rest of him. Like the great majority of scientists and philosophers throughout history, I too was putting cognition into the head and forgetting about the body, treating it as something that got in the way of pure cerebral thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a philosopher hadn’t been my only dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d decided to study philosophy after becoming a frustrated musician. My parents, God bless them, considered that singing opera and playing piano were cool ways to impress the visitors, but wouldn’t lead to a career. Now they regret their decision not to allow me to take a musical path. When visitors politely ask what their daughter is doing for a living and they reply: ‘She’s a philosopher,’ the visitors look puzzled as if needing an extra explanation: ‘Yes, but what exactly is she &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;?’ My parents can’t say ‘she’s &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;’ because that would make them look silly, and they are extremely proud and reasonable folks. Now, if I were a musician, well, that would have been way simpler. Everyone gets what &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;musicians do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt a modern fascination with the thinking brain as the fundamental basis of human cognition. But why? Is this the only entrance point that allows us to understand who we are and what human cognition is? Here I propose another angle. While neurons are indeed fascinating, their complex activity is only part of the story of human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, brains are part of the body, and bodies are made of cells and many other constituents, some of which are not literally &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt;, like our unique DNA is. There are many ‘Brain and Body’ research institutes around the world, but no ‘Liver and Body’ institutes. Why is that? It’s because we think the liver is (part) of the body. But why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body? There’s no evidence that the brain is made of a different kind of ‘physical stuff’ from the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a shift in focus from neural to cellular processing to highlight the fundamental role of cells in constituting biological self-organising systems such as the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he journey of understanding who we are, scientifically and philosophically, starts traditionally with a thinking guy – yes, it’s usually a guy, a solitary male genius – sorting out the mystery of the Universe from within his ivory tower. Yet, the journey of who we are as living beings starts way before, when a couple of cells start negotiating energetic resources with some other bunch of cells in the depths of a womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a philosopher/frustrated musician/cognitive neuroscientist, I now give academic talks all over the world, and one of my favourite things to do is to say the following line while carefully scanning the audience for their reactions: ‘You have all spent time growing inside another person’s body.’ Most of the time, people’s eyes widen as if some big mystery has just been revealed to them. Some nod their heads, others seem perplexed or in denial. But surely these smart academics know that babies don’t just drop from the sky or pop out from cabbages? As adults, we all know that we have been babies ourselves, and that we have all developed inside another person’s body. Why is this biological and scientific fact so difficult to recognise for our intelligentsia? Why are we so obsessed with minds, with pure self-conscious minds, while forgetting about bodies, and specifically about the other body that carried and fed our own one? Just think about it: long before being these lovely adults with hopes and dreams and failures, drinking coffee, paying taxes, and reading fancy books and articles online, each of us spent some time as a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;single cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more mind-blowing: all human beings gradually develop from cells to a human body &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; another human body. Pregnancy is a universal human fact that concerns everyone, not just a few of us. All cells of the human organism originate from a single cell, the zygote, are closely interconnected, mutually influence one another, and operate in synchrony to achieve common goals – maintenance of homeostasis and constant adaptation to changes of the surrounding environment. This means that we arrive into this world not on a solitary rock dropped by some mastermind, but as living biological creatures deeply dependent upon and connected with another living body. And then we need others to take care of us for quite some time before we can find a rock to sit on and think about deep things like the meaning of life or quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;For that Thinker to contemplate the meaning of life, he has to self-regulate his humble internal bodily states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand minds, we need to grasp first how we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; minds. We need to start with the cells that compose our humble toes before zooming into the mystery of the brain. Why? Because our cells solve the biggest and most urgent problem of this great and mysterious adventure called life without a brain, and before we had a brain: how to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are living creatures. Living creatures are self-organising biological systems whose bodies constantly perform the humble yet essential, basic task of keeping track of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-related information-processing to secure survival. In short, this means that your body works for you even when &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/two-billion-humans-are-doing-something-bizarre-right-now-sleeping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;you are asleep&lt;/a&gt; or under anaesthesia: your heart keeps beating for you, not for someone else. This also means that all bodily processes have &lt;em&gt;the self&lt;/em&gt; at their very core, simply because they obey the universal drive governing all living systems which is: &lt;em&gt;don’t die!&lt;/em&gt; Self-preservation is fundamental. But because our body is a living system governed by the basic law of self-preservation, this means that all our experiences are necessarily embodied &lt;em&gt;self-&lt;/em&gt;experiences. In perceiving and experiencing the world, we ‘smuggle in’ our own fundamental self-survival goals. This is something we share with cats and worms and viruses. Whether this is also something we share with artificial systems is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodily experiences are thus necessarily connected to biological self-regulation (or homeostasis) and self-preservation. For example, a penguin can survive in very cold temperatures, while humans can’t. Every organism has a set of optimal states it has to maintain in order to stay alive. If you are too cold, or too hot, or you need to go to the loo, or you are hungry and dream of salads, then you can’t think properly and solve complex abstract problems. For that Thinker to be able to contemplate the meaning of life on a rock, first he has to successfully self-regulate his humble internal bodily states. In short, the body is life – it is the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of human existence. If one is alive, one is experiencing through one’s body, even when asleep, even under anaesthesia. And this very simple idea is crucial for redefining how we understand cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;et’s forget for a moment the Thinker, static and isolated on his pedestal, and go back to the growing or developing thinker. How did she get there in the first place? What is this thinker made of? Is she hungry or upset? All these questions may seem silly or irrelevant for the noble question ‘What is cognition?’ but here I suggest that, actually, it’s quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the neurons work and how we get from neurons to minds, we first need to get back to square one, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381002100043X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; how we get from cells to selves.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Jean de Calan, © and courtesy &lt;a href="https://collections.musee-rodin.fr/page/dessins/66615bc8b358e62d33dee7bd?v=mosaic&amp;amp;s=domaine&amp;amp;so=desc&amp;amp;pgn=39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Musée Rodin, Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence from neurobiology and biochemistry suggests that cognitive categories such as ‘sensing’, ‘memory’ and ‘learning’ can be applied non-metaphorically to the behaviour of simple organisms such as bacteria. Previous work on ‘basal cognition’ questioned the prevailing idea that only brains (ie, collectives of neuronal cells) have the ability to ‘cognise’ or ‘learn’. Rather, non-neural cells and simple organisms may also be &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived&lt;/a&gt; as active, primitive ‘cognisers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of cells must cooperate toward the production of one ‘embryo’ – achieving specific goals in their navigation of anatomical morphospace. But if the blastocyst is cut into pieces, each fragment self-organises its own embryo, resulting in monozygotic twins, triplets and so forth (which may or may not be conjoined). Thus, each cell is some other cell’s ‘external’ neighbour, and the collective must dynamically decide where the embryo ends and the outside world begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;brain yet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a dynamic and complex self-organising system such as the human body needs to be able to play a double poker game, so to speak, to survive and potentially reproduce. First, it must successfully maintain sensory states within certain physiologically viable bounds. Second, it must flexibly change these states to adapt to a volatile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose you are a cell within a self-organising biological system called the human body and you are obsessed with survival, like all sensible living creatures are. You don’t have a brain yet, no neurons at your disposal, but you still need to survive somehow. What do you do? How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a brain yet? It’s a major puzzle that Nature had to solve via billions of years of trials and errors. And she &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;did! How?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we need to answer the following question: which is the basic system at the organismic level that tells your cells which one is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; cell, and which one is not? The world is full of signals, and disturbing noise. You have to have some sort of filter that allows you to focus on what is vital for you and to dismiss or fight back against what is not good for you. That’s the job of the immune system. For adaptive biological self-organising systems such as the human body, immune cells develop before neurons, in order to take care and keep track of one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theory I propose here considers all bodily cells and their complex interconnections as being fundamental for cognition, not just neurons. Among our cells, the immune system plays a very special role, working in tandem with the neural system to help us build the ‘self’. The brain is usually considered &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/the-brain-has-a-team-of-conductors-orchestrating-consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the conductor&lt;/a&gt; of the orchestra playing the concertos of your mind. I disagree. Nature invented a maestro way more discrete, less showy and dazzling perhaps than the brain and its sparkling connections, but older and very efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he metabolic self-regulation and the immune system are fundamental components of organismic self-organisation in humans. It comprises a cellular network capable of distinguishing between self, non-self, missing self, and aberrant self, including misplaced cells and aberrant intracellular and extracellular molecules. In addition, the immune system also regulates the nervous system, behaviour, metabolism and thermogenesis, and takes part in the fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neuroimmune tandem acts as key ‘fact-checker’ for all incoming information relevant for self-survival. From the body’s perspective, there is no such thing as perceptual time off or ‘blackout’ (except when one is dead). The body needs to keep track of one’s ‘self’ information all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being fundamentally a bodily system, the brain needs to carefully orchestrate and align its neural processing with a complex network of other types of cellular processing, particularly the immune system, to ensure the organism’s survival and to allow it to continue to have viable interactions with the world. Importantly, this idea was already present in the pioneering &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1878127/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of Francisco Varela and colleagues who spent quite some time working on the immune system in relation to cognitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before neurons get off the ground, your immune system needs to be clever enough to tell which cell is ‘self’ and which one is not. If, for some reason, your immune cells get tricked and let a virus in, say, then that may be the end of our Thinker, and no contemplation of the meaning of life on a rock will be possible afterwards. Life happens way before, at the bodily, cellular level, without our explicit awareness. And life happens to us without our permission, so to speak. None of us chose to be alive. It simply happens to us. It happened to my cat, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Simon too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we begin examining and introspecting the human mind and its mysteries systematically, as a scientific and philosophical endeavour, inevitably we are adults and hence we question the world from &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; adult perspective. In doing so, however, we may blindly use an adult-biased lens, which prevents us from capturing fundamental aspects of our minds. This observation seems trivial at first sight, yet &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it is not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do not pop out like Athena from Zeus’ head, or like the Thinker from Rodin’s hands. Rather, we are gestated, born, developing, decaying, and eventually dying. In real life, only at very rare occasions can one afford to stop and think like Rodin’s character, solitary and isolated on a rock. In real life, one needs to move, to interact, to change, to fall, to get up and fall again. Most of the time, we need to think on the fly while acting and interacting with the world and others. Also, we are rarely alone, and we are never just abstract minds, we are deeply embodied creatures, driven by hunger and longing to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is this piece about how eating salads and connecting with your mother is more important than thinking? In a way, yes. You can exist without thinking, but you can’t exist (for very long) without eating or connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly: one can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing. Experiences come to the surface of being through the body, and not through the minds, or some sort of homunculus sitting in our heads, trying to ‘make sense’ of a world he doesn’t see, because the world is hidden in the black box of the scalp. We don’t perceive the world through some sort of inner solitary lens situated in our heads. We perceive the world through every single cell of our body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because human bodies first develop within another human body, at the beginning of our life, we perceive the world literally through another body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;This is what thinking is for: dealing with the messy jungle of life rather than the clean space of chess-playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pregnancy, (at least) two immune systems need to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-pregnancy-is-a-biological-war-between-mother-and-baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;negotiate the exchange&lt;/a&gt; of resources and information in order to maintain viable self-regulation of nested systems. The relationship, and the interactions between the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; self-organising systems during pregnancy may play a pivotal role in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understanding&lt;/a&gt; the nature of biological self-organisation per se in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was traditionally assumed that the placenta and the fetus are non-active immunological organs – largely depending on the maternal immune system – recent work suggests a more complex picture. The placenta and the fetus represent an ‘additional immunological organ which affects the global response of the mother to microbial infections,’ as the physiology researchers Gil Mor and Ingrid Cardenas &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367629/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. The type of response initiated in the placenta may determine the immunological response of the mother, impacting the pregnancy outcome. The placenta represents an active immunological organ, highly responsive to foreign pathogens. For example, it has been shown that the placenta functions as a regulator of, rather than a barrier to, the trafficking between the fetus and the mother. Both the fetus and the placenta present an active immune system that has a direct effect on the way the mother responds to the environment. Importantly for our discussion here, the placental-immune system creates a pregnancy-friendly protective environment while still being fully operational and able to defend the mother and fetus against infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is always a collective decision and a collective endeavour. If this is so, then why are we focusing on solitary brains and high-level cognitive abilities such as chess-playing to understand cognition? The radical claim here is that a creature with neurons only cannot develop, act and survive in the wild. And, ultimately, this is what thinking is for: successfully dealing with the messy and unpredictable jungle of life rather than with the clean and predictable space of chess-playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;erhaps all those modern obsessions about thinking and neural models of cognition were built to raise high the ceiling of our pure minds protecting us from the impure, messy and constantly dying and birthing cells of our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we are experiencing and cognising the world with every single cell in our entire body, not just the maestro brain? All our humble bodily cells participate in the making of our experiences and cognitive processes, and not just the ‘noble’ neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this really mean that we need our whole body to think? Surely I can cut off my toe, say, and still think? So what exactly is meant by saying that cognition is not in &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt; and that I need the whole body? However, the really important question is: was your body ‘dumb’ before you had a brain? If so, how did you manage to survive without neurons? Who did the smart heavy lifting of information-processing for survival, to allow brains to grow properly in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that famous Rodin sculpture was supposed to represent not a philosopher, but a poet – &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-fractal-consciousness-of-dantes-divine-comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dante, the author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;. The artist represented the poet sitting at the door of the Inferno and other worlds, contemplating &lt;em&gt;the space in between&lt;/em&gt;, the border, the passage between life and death. Perhaps what Rodin was trying to show us was that the meaning of all this lies not hidden inside one’s head, but in what lies &lt;em&gt;in between &lt;/em&gt;us, the world, and others. And here I say that this fascinating ‘in between’, for which we don’t have a word in our Western societies yet, starts already in the womb, with the placenta, the mysterious messy bridge that brings life to life through another’s living body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQVl1aks5MG0zR05WVF9zVnBEZDN1U1BCR1BTN29JQW55S3JXNmZENS1zRlctWkNZM3VmdzZRWHZrRUk2bTRGekhXUDk2UmxGS3MzT19JRjBoVlVNbEM2QzloaHJCTWRsX1ozRW1JZ2dQZmZzN0ZOZ0NVSi0tQWFQc19SS1Q</guid></item><item><title>基因疗法为患有致命“泡泡男孩病”的婴儿提供了治疗方法-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/27/well/bubble-boy-disease-gene-therapy.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:00:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOVkpWVjF1UVBFbDBNbmU5ajU3NDItTXk5bzZkdFFoZnZ2clhCVEwtWUhDNW5vX0lxdE9Ga2VCOG16YUZ6bkswVWZRUGNZcFJ4bDBwMjdJaTlLdUNYc0pTSmhYTV84aGR3V1haNzh4UnVreU5ZR1VGZ2dGa09JNTcwOWF3</guid></item><item><title>科学家将老化的血液干细胞恢复到小鼠更年轻的状态- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-restore-aging-blood-stem-cells-to-a-more-youthful-state-in-mice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Deep within your bone marrow, a specialized set of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; is busy pumping out &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-origins-of-our-blood-are-not-what-we-thought-mouse-study-suggests"&gt;new blood cells&lt;/a&gt; to sustain your body. As we age, these &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"&gt;hematopoietic stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (or HSCs) become less productive, affecting our immune system and increasing our risk of conditions like anemia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have found a way to rewind the clock in aging HSCs, which could potentially help to treat age-related blood and immune deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most of our cells, HSCs contain tiny compartments known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"&gt;lysosomes&lt;/a&gt;. These are the cells' recycling centers, where complex molecules like proteins and lipids are sent to be broken down into smaller, reusable parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/embryo-like-blood-factories-could-one-day-supplement-donations"&gt;Embryo-Like 'Blood Factories' Could One Day Supplement Donations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that many of the problems that arise in elderly HSCs are due to lysosomes gone haywire, as revealed in a new study by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US and Paris Cité University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stem cell&lt;/a&gt; biologist Saghi Ghaffari led experiments in mice to find that the lysosomes in the HSCs of elderly mice were extremely acidic and downright dysfunctional. HSCs collected from old mice were in overdrive, ramping up the cell's glucose metabolism and messing with the way the cell activates and uses genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hyperactivity is the opposite of how young HSCs behave: They are renowned for their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.09.029"&gt;quiescence&lt;/a&gt;, a reversible pause button that grants cells a period of stability and longevity by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.16472"&gt;avoiding stress and DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible. Quiescence also makes young HSCs more potent blood cell producers when re-awakened than aged cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghaffari and team were able to 'quieten' the distressed, elderly lysosomes in old HSCs with a chemical named &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Concanamycin-a"&gt;concanamycin A&lt;/a&gt;, which returned their pH and activity levels to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By removing the HSCs from mice and treating them with the chemical before returning the cells to their owners, the tissue's ability to produce new blood cells increased eight times over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their lysosomes stabilized, old stem cells began to behave more 'youthfully', too. Their ability to regenerate improved, and they resumed blood cell production in appropriate ratios, reversing the old HSCs' tendency to reduce the immune system's efficiency by producing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V100.4.1302.h81602001302_1302_1309"&gt;more of certain cells&lt;/a&gt; than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings reveal that aging in blood stem cells is not an irreversible fate. Old blood stem cells have the capacity to revert to a youthful state; they can bounce back," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By slowing down the lysosomes and reducing their acidity, stem cells became healthier and could make new, balanced blood cells and new stem cells much more effectively. By targeting lysosomal hyperactivity, we were able to reset aged stem cells to a younger, healthier state, improving their ability to regenerate blood and immune cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elderly HSCs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2012-0033"&gt;aren't highly suitable candidates&lt;/a&gt; for stem cell transplants, but the stem cells treated with concanamycin A appeared rejuvenated and were successfully transplanted in an animal model, suggesting a similar &lt;em&gt;ex vivo &lt;/em&gt;treatment could be used to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-key-to-creating-blood-stem-cells-may-lie-in-your-own-blood"&gt;improve the success&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/turns-out-that-bone-marrow-isn-t-the-only-place-in-our-body-we-make-blood-cells"&gt;human stem cell transplants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, further testing will be needed as the study only focused on how this all works in the cells of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lysosomal dysfunction emerges as a central driver of stem cell aging," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting this pathway may one day help maintain healthy blood and immune systems in the elderly, improve their stem cells for transplantation, and reduce the risk of age-associated blood disorders and perhaps have an effect on overall aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.10.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ingredient which is found in a number of plants, though it has been described as the nearest thing to 'natural Ozempic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to a 2022 review of 18 studies, a berberine supplement resulted in reduced body weight, BMI, fasting blood glucose and LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It works by increasing insulin production by activating bitter taste receptors in the intestines, which decreases body weight and lipids, increasing GLP-1 in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A daily cup of green tea could make all the difference, according to the study (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wheat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Wheat protein hydrolysate is a protein which is derived from wheat when broken down and it contains high amounts of amino acids and peptides, which can lower blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It does this by releasing GLP-1, which can also help to reduce hyperglycemia according to past studies, say the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermented green tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's said that fermenting tea with a culture of bacteria and yeast, which can form kombucha, can make a drink which 'mimics' Ozempic. This is because of compounds that are found in green tea particularly, primarily epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant known for its inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A 2018 study &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464618302470"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that this can even stimulate GLP-1 release if taken with caffeine, after a study on mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A cup of green tea alone can enhance methods of treating diabetes, with a daily dose can help to stimulate characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 03:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOUUowQmNmOTEySjc3eHBwamF3R3g4djhtR245cUhGT2p4U1JFM2FYNW5JV0toVUxybG95ZDdmemF3QWlfNHVjV1phNWN3c2VkQTB3TzF4U1Z2LThQS2VSOEdoM0s2NkJoc25jTXhRREZqRXdiZHl1bHJrcFRqalI4LTB4R3ltTElKVnIzTkFOMTN2N1hDYV9YU2VKXzlBaGc4</guid></item><item><title>忘记药物：血糖专家揭示预防2型糖尿病的日常家庭习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/forget-medicine-blood-sugar-experts-reveal-daily-home-habits-to-prevent-type-2-diabetes/articleshow/125582096.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the secret to protecting your family from Type 2 diabetes was not found in a clinic but in your everyday routines including your dinner table, your evening walks, even your bedtime habits? Doctors say that prevention begins long before medication does and often with the simplest moments like moving together, eating better, sleeping well and learning to hit pause on stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world continues to experience one of the fastest rises in type 2 diabetes, Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran, Consultant - Internal Medicine at Rela Hospital in Chennai, note in an interview with the Times of India, “Even young individuals are prone to develop Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The current scenario is such that no age is safe anymore. Diabetes now affects teenagers, young adults and even children.” While genetics play a major role, he asserted that the contributing factors apart from genetic susceptibility are consumption of junk food, not eating on time, physical activity, childhood obesity, stress and lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts insist that small, daily lifestyle habits can reduce this risk dramatically.

A major &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-016-4079-0" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2016 pooled analysis published in Diabetologia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that even 150 minutes of brisk walking per week lowered Type 2 diabetes risk by up to 26%. The researchers found, “Higher levels of total physical activity were associated with a significantly lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this can be as simple as evening walks, cycling together, weekend swimming sessions or short dance workouts at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Managing screen time: Digital discipline for all ages&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman warned that excessive screen time, in both children and adults, creates a cycle of inactivity, overeating and disrupted sleep. “Too much screen time promotes an inactive lifestyle and encourages irregular eating and sleep patterns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global research confirms this. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6688457" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2021 study in the Journal of Diabetes Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that prolonged screen time was directly associated with higher BMI and poorer glycaemic indicators in adults. The researchers revealed, “Longer screen time was significantly linked with obesity and increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman recommended simple screen-time discipline strategies that include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting a daily limit to use phones if not for educational purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid screen time while eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace casual screen times with reading books and other activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a no-screens-one-hour-before-bed rule as it disturbs your sleep time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress management: Protecting both mind and metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress significantly affects blood sugar. Dr Sundararaman explained, “Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which raises blood glucose levels.

The study established, “Higher cortisol responses were associated with an increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman advised healthy stress-management habits that families can adopt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 minutes of daily deep-breathing or guided meditation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritising consistent sleep (7–8 hours)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily “unplugged” family time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open communication without digital distractions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition: Small swaps that make a big difference&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran emphasised how dietary patterns shape metabolic health from childhood onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Minor changes in lifestyle, especially food choices, play an important role in preventing diabetes.

			&lt;p&gt;Can tattoos protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, or do they make things worse? A new study I conducted with colleagues suggests there may be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that people with tattoos had a 29% higher risk of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183256" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; often linked to ultraviolet (UV) exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tattoos did not appear to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma, another type of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/skin-cancer-1260"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; related to UV damage. Although both cancers share a common cause, they arise from different cell types and differ in severity, with melanoma being far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/could-a-tattoo-raise-your-risk-of-skin-cancer-twin-studies-suggest-a-link"&gt;Could a Tattoo Raise Your Risk of Skin Cancer? Twin Studies Suggest a Link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattoos are a powerful form of self-expression and a cornerstone of modern identity. In Sweden, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckaf178/8323409"&gt;around one in three adults&lt;/a&gt; is tattooed, showing how body art has moved firmly into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite their popularity, scientists still do not know whether tattoos have any impact on health, or how any potential effects might unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists are now trying to answer these questions. The work is challenging because people who choose to get tattoos often differ from those who do not in ways that can influence health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty is that most health records do not note whether someone is tattooed, which means long-term patterns are hard to study. Without this basic information, it becomes difficult to know whether tattoos themselves play a role in health or whether differences are driven by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma both develop slowly and are relatively uncommon, which makes long-term research challenging. Following large groups of tattooed and non-tattooed people for many years would be expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-025-01326-6"&gt;So our team used a different approach&lt;/a&gt;. We started with people who had already been diagnosed with cancer and looked backward to see who had tattoos. This type of research, known as a case-control study, is an efficient way to detect potential associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden maintains high-quality national registers that record information on health and demographics. From &lt;a href="https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/statistics-and-data/registers/national-cancer-register/"&gt;the National Cancer Register&lt;/a&gt;, we identified everyone aged 20 to 60 who was diagnosed with melanoma in 2017 or squamous cell carcinoma between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included 2,880 melanoma cases and 2,821 squamous cell carcinoma cases. For each case, we selected three comparison people of the same age and sex from the Total Population Register, who had not been diagnosed with skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then sent questionnaires to all participants, asking about tattoos, including decorative tattoos, permanent makeup and medical tattoos, as well as their size, location, and age at first tattoo. This allowed us to establish whether someone had been tattooed before or after developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,695 people took part in the melanoma study (1,598 with melanoma) and 6,151 in the squamous cell carcinoma study (1,600 with that cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with tattoos were 29% more likely to develop melanoma compared with those without tattoos. The risk increase seemed to be highest in those who had tattoos for more than ten years, although the numbers were smaller in this group, so results should be interpreted cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For squamous cell carcinoma, tattoos made no difference. The results were consistent across analyses, suggesting no link between tattoos and this type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found no evidence that larger tattoos increased risk. This was unexpected, since larger tattoos contain more ink and therefore more potentially harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that tattoo ink does not remain confined to the skin. The body's immune system treats it as a foreign substance and transports some ink &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28900193/"&gt;particles to the lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles can stay there long-term. While we do not yet know whether this causes harm, it could potentially lead to chronic inflammation, which has been linked to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation may be measurement error: people tend to overestimate tattoo size. Future studies using more precise measures may help clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle and confounding factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study unique is the range of lifestyle factors we could consider. We included data on sun exposure (both occupational and recreational), tanning bed use, smoking, education level, marital status and household income. We also factored in skin type, pigmentation, age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These details matter because they can influence both who gets tattoos and who develops cancer. For instance, people who spend a lot of time in the sun may be more likely to have tattoos and to develop melanoma. Accounting for these differences reduces bias and strengthens confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research, this issue is known as confounding. If &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/confounding-factors"&gt;confounding factors&lt;/a&gt; are not properly controlled, they can distort findings and lead to misleading conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djaf235/8239343"&gt;US research&lt;/a&gt; suggested that large tattoos might even reduce the risk of melanoma, but that study did not control for key factors such as skin type or UV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may therefore reflect behaviour rather than biology. For example, people with large tattoos may avoid sunbathing or tanning beds to protect their body art, which would naturally reduce UV damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-linked-to-increased-cancer-risk-scientists-warn"&gt;Tattoos Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do tattoos cause skin cancer? The simple answer is that we do not know yet. Our results suggest a possible link between tattoos and melanoma, but one study is never enough to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to explore potential biological mechanisms, such as chronic inflammation, and to examine how different types of ink or colours might interact with UV exposure. The composition of tattoo pigments varies widely, and many contain compounds that can break down into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833639/"&gt;harmful by-products&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight or laser removal treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have tattoos, there is no need for panic, but awareness matters. Continue to protect your skin from UV radiation just as you would otherwise: use sunscreen, avoid excessive tanning and check your skin regularly for new or changing moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlight the need for long-term monitoring and better data collection on tattoos in health records. With tattoos now common worldwide, this is an important public health issue. Continued research into the biology of tattoos and their long-term effects will help ensure that people can make informed choices about their bodies, their art and their health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266809/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Up to 10% of asthmatics have severe disease and, in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial findings, published in the the Lancet Respiratory Medicine and presented at the British Thoracic Society winter meeting, also showed that tezepelumab significantly improved asthma symptoms, lung function and overall quality of life. During the study, two-thirds of patients did not have any asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, prof David Jackson, who is a respiratory medicine expert at King’s College London and asthma services clinical lead at Guy’s and Royal Brompton hospitals, said: “As tezepelumab also suppresses allergy-related symptoms and improves chronic rhinosinusitis as well, the results are particularly exciting for patients with severe asthma who suffer with both upper and lower airway symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/asthma" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Asthma&lt;/a&gt; + Lung UK, said: “This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s vital that research into new types of treatment continues, but we know current funding for lung health research is on life support, despite lung conditions remaining the third biggest cause of death in the UK.

&lt;div class="tdb-block-inner td-fix-index"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) acknowledged Wednesday that the controversial &lt;a href="https://monseyscoop.com/outrageous-robocall-rockland-county-sends-unauthorized-measles-alert-misusing-hatzolohs-name/"&gt;measles-related robocall sent to thousands of Ramapo residents did not match the message previously discussed with Hatzoloh of Rockland&lt;/a&gt;, despite the two organizations having coordinated on a general vaccination reminder ahead of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCDOH said it had worked with Hatzolah on crafting a notification, but “the message that was agreed upon was not what was ultimately sent out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We regret how it played out,” the department added, noting that officials are reviewing the incident “to ensure it does not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsey Scoop reached out to Hatzoloh, which said they appreciate the county’s clarification and “hope to work together going forward to ensure the right messaging is communicated to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county also reminded residents that free measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations will be available next week through the RCDOH Mobile Vaccination Van:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, December 2&lt;br&gt;
10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
Rockland Kosher Supermarket, 27 Orchard Street, Monsey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccines are also available at local healthcare providers, including Refuah Health and Sun River Health, or by calling the Rockland County Department of Health at 845-364-2497 or 845-364-2520.&lt;/p&gt;

Utah experts advise a radon test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think about family history, genetics, or age when they think about Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those factors are well known, researchers are now studying whether long-term exposure to certain environmental conditions may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those conditions is radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas found throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah health and environmental experts encourage residents to pay attention to radon levels in their homes, especially because radon exposure builds slowly over time and can go unnoticed for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test kit at &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_top" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon forms naturally as uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It moves upward and can enter homes through small openings in foundations, basements, crawl spaces and utility gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon has no color, taste, or odor, so homeowners cannot detect it without a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the [Envionmental Protection Agency](Envionmental Protection Agency), long-term radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has a higher radon potential than many other states due to its unique geology. Recent data shows that almost half of all Utah homes have elevated radon levels, underscoring the importance of routine testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do we know about Alzheimer's risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients are 65 and older, and the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. Genetics, family history and certain heart and blood vessel conditions may also contribute to increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Beaunitta Van Wyk/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say about radon and cognitive health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to study whether long-term exposure to radon may affect neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671130/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Environmental Health Perspectives found evidence that ionizing radiation may contribute to cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's. The authors noted that these effects may accumulate over many years of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because radon exposure is preventable, Utah residents have an opportunity to reduce one potential environmental risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is simple. Families can order a free test kit from &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_mid" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why radon testing matters for Utah families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Utah homeowners who test their homes are surprised by their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon has no symptoms and no noticeable signs, homes with elevated levels often appear completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is straightforward. UtahRadon.org provides free test kits to all Utah residents. The test only takes a few minutes to place in the home and is then mailed to a certified third-party laboratory for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If your home tests high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels can be reduced by installing a mitigation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are installed by certified professionals and are designed to continuously vent radon from beneath the home to the outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most installations are completed in a single visit and begin lowering radon levels immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is invisible and odorless, but it is measurable, and homeowners have control over their exposure. Testing allows families to understand their risk and take action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test by visiting &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_bottom" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

New research suggests simpler physical therapies can give stronger relief with fewer risks for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of thousands of patients points to knee braces, warm water therapy, and structured exercise as top options for knee arthritis. These approaches work without adding new drugs and help people climb and walk with less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-osteoarthritis-and-pills"&gt;Osteoarthritis and pills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with osteoarthritis, a joint disease that slowly damages cartilage and limits movement, are told to manage pain with pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 528 million people live with osteoarthritis and roughly 365 million have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/"&gt;knee involvement&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Yuan Luo, a rehabilitation specialist at the First People’s Hospital of Neijiang in southwest China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo’s research focuses on comparing non drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis to help patients avoid unnecessary medication side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with knee arthritis rely on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547742/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/a&gt;), medicines that reduce inflammation but can harm the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs also raise concerns about kidney stress and heart problems when used for long periods, particularly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of NSAID use in people over 60 found higher rates of serious gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney injury among regular users. That work also tied long term NSAID exposure to more cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-study-did-differently"&gt;What this study did differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of testing one treatment at a time, Luo’s team compared many therapies at once. They used a network meta-analysis, a method that combines results from many trials, so treatments can be ranked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the comparison, researchers pooled 139 trials that tested 12 non-drug options for knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those trials examined laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, taping, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, and several exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined standard rating scales that scored pain, stiffness, and day to day function. Those scores let them estimate which options worked best overall without letting any single small study dominate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions,” said Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-braces-shift-the-load"&gt;How braces shift the load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A knee brace for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is usually a rigid or semi rigid device that wraps around the joint. By changing how body weight passes through the knee, the brace can take pressure off the worn compartment and reduce irritation of sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical research on unloader braces, rigid supports that relieve pressure from one side of the knee, shows clear short term pain relief. Several trials also report better function and longer walking distance when people use these braces consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overview of 14 brace studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6028281/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that many users experienced better overall quality of life while they wore the device. The authors also found early signs that bracing could delay knee replacement for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braces have drawbacks, including bulk, skin irritation, and the hassle of wearing them for hours per day. Real world studies suggest many people stop using their brace or wear it only briefly, so comfort and fit can influence success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-water-and-exercise-matter"&gt;Why water and exercise matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrotherapy involves guided exercise in warm water that supports body weight and lets joints move with less impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955208/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of aquatic exercise programs found that water based sessions reduce pain and joint dysfunction for people with osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those benefits were especially clear for participants who struggled to tolerate land based workouts because of pain or poor balance. In Luo’s ranking, hydrotherapy rose to the top when a combined arthritis score was used, capturing gains in pain, stiffness, and daily function together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits reports from pool programs that work with older adults who have knee arthritis. In warm water, they can practice balance, strength, and walking drills without the sharp jolts they feel on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land based exercise also remains a central part of care for people with knee osteoarthritis. Walking, strengthening, simple balance drills, supervised sessions, and support for weight and self management are all strongly recommended in major clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What this means for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ranking supports a model where braces, exercise, and hydrotherapy sit at the center of long term care. In that approach, medications are used carefully as add ons, not the automatic first line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these physical treatments shift load, strengthen muscles, and retrain movement patterns, they aim at causes of pain rather than only numbing signals. That focus on mechanics and strength can matter more than short courses of pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International bodies now encourage combinations of non drug and drug therapies tailored to each person with knee symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibiofemoral bracing and structured exercise sit among the most strongly endorsed options for painful knee osteoarthritis. Practical care plans often layer a brace for high demand activities with regular supervised exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pool time when available and short courses of medication during symptom flares are added instead of escalating straight to injections or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-to-learn-about-osteoarthritis"&gt;More to learn about osteoarthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/womans-knee-pain-caused-by-the-presence-of-gold-threads-in-her-joints/"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt; can ask their clinician whether an unloading brace or a supervised exercise program is appropriate for their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also ask about referral to aquatic therapy when their balance, weight, or other conditions make land exercise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about brace fit, how many hours to wear it, and which exercises are safe help tailor treatment and may improve comfort and adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific goals, such as hiking, kneeling, or climbing stairs for work, can guide which therapies deserve the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still need longer studies that follow brace users and exercise participants over several years. Those trials could reveal whether these approaches delay joint replacement and remain cost effective as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo and colleagues also note that combinations of therapies, such as bracing plus hydrotherapy, could prove more powerful than any single option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust trials of those treatment packages are still rare, so the best mix and timing remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0324864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:58:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNajRIdXFPeTNSZUEzYlRBdWhrbE01bDVWMWdNZXBmUWg3QzhIYmQ0YVNET09kNkYwdkR6d2F2X2UtR3MybUlQM2JrczFBcE5kOFU2dzg2MGlmODU0YlluVTZJVDYxQWJiVnJXNGZpV3Z0blFoX0x2Nm56YV9wOU92R2Q3QjZfdDVyZEdlWTNrekJNc2h1SVN1dHh5VU5wTHh3bE5HQ0hHOVI</guid></item><item><title>2026年推出的狗用抗衰老药？ FDA支持的药物须知|《印度斯坦时报》-《印度斯坦时报》</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new anti-aging pill for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/us/most-popular-dog-breed-of-2025-in-us-its-not-golden-retriever-101758291889420.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="dogs"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; that has the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fda" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;'s backing and is reportedly close to getting approval as well, several &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/regulating-social-media-for-children-101763999954648-amp.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="social media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; posts have claimed.

While the news of the pill has begun to do the rounds now, the company had shared an update about it in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;LOY-002, our program bringing longevity to dogs of almost all sizes, has also earned its formal FDA acceptance for reasonable expectation of efficacy (RXE),” the company announced in a blog post.&lt;/span&gt; The company noted there were two more primary FDA requirements for conditional approval. These are manufacturing and safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company had noted that it had extensive date supporting both and expressed a hope to have completed regulatory requirements by the end of 2025. This would make the FDA-approved longevity drug, which has been called anti-aging pill online, a reality for millions of dogs in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;WQHT or Hot 97 noted, “Loyal, a biotech company, has been developing a medication aimed at slowing aging in large-breed dogs, and early results indicate it may add more healthy years rather than extending the more fragile stage of life.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So far, the outlook is promising: a pilot study involving 48 dogs reported no adverse effects after three months of taking the drug,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“The longevity space is crowded right now, and for good reason. We all want to figure out how to get more happy, healthy years for our loved ones — especially the furry ones,” Celine Halioua, founder and CEO of Loyal had said in a June 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/health/new-longevity-drug-for-dogs-could-extend-your-pets-life/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the New York Post. In February, Halioua had said on X, “Loyal’s drug for senior dog lifespan extension drug LOY-002 has completed its FDA efficacy package (RXE). We are on track to hopefully bring the first longevity drug to market *this year*.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How the anti-aging pill for dogs work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Loyal, LOY-002 is a caloric restriction mimetic. This means, it delivers the benefits of caloric restriction through a drug, thus creating a situation where there is no weight loss or appetite suppression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This comes after a study showed that calorie-restricted dogs lived ~2 years longer that other furry fellows, and saw a delayed onset of cancer and osteoarthritis.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This pill will be for ‘senior’ dogs, Loyal noted, and they stated they're pursuing FDA approval for use in dogs 10 years and older and who weigh at least 14 lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着诺如病毒病例的增加，以下是关于今年传播的知识—以及如何保护自己- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55e861" class="body-graf"&gt;A nasty, highly contagious virus is spreading across the country ahead of the holiday season — and it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cold-and-flu/flu-season-just-beginning-doctors-are-already-high-alert-rcna245148" target="_blank"&gt;the flu&lt;/a&gt;

Between August and November 2024, there were 235 reported norovirus outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96bef7" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 153 outbreaks during the same time period this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ec07" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the same level of illnesses will continue into 2026, but outbreaks are expected to keep rising, Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-182ed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have three years of data to kind of show that we have this strong seasonal pattern,” she said. “But I can’t say right now how big of a peak it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2b81" class="body-graf"&gt;A CDC spokesperson said the agency is closely monitoring the norovirus season, which is most common from November to April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aef629" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC tracks norovirus through voluntary reporting from clinical laboratories and health departments, but doesn’t currently monitor for norovirus through wastewater, which may be a reason its tracking doesn’t match the WastewaterScan data. People may be sick, but not go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2725b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bidwell said wastewater is an “unbiased way of looking at what is happening in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a409e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what to know about norovirus and its spread this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d5e34" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus variant becoming more dominant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aabe29" class="body-graf"&gt;For over 30 years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" target="_blank"&gt;norovirus outbreaks have been dominated by one strain&lt;/a&gt;, GII.4. Last year’s outbreaks were &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank"&gt;overwhelmingly caused&lt;/a&gt; by the variant GII.17, making up around 75% of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c987" class="body-graf"&gt;The GII.17 strain has become more prevalent in several countries, including the United States, through the 2020s. The rise of GII.17 may explain why the 2024 spikes and this year’s spread started earlier in October, instead of winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b60133" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said a combination of factors may have led to GII.17’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-033782" class="body-graf"&gt;“The two possibilities is that something in the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or there were changes in the population that a larger proportion were susceptible,” he said. “And probably it’s a combination of both. But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ea117" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Craig Wilen, associate professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at Yale University, said GII.17 may not actually be more transmissible, but many people probably have less immunity to the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-463d92" class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably the GII.17 last year was so effective at infecting so many people because we had significantly less immunity to that virus, since it was different enough from viruses that we’ve previously been infected with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to say how this year’s norovirus season will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28da7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Atmar said either variant has a “50/50 chance” of dominating this year, but doesn’t expect the same level of illnesses as last year because of “increased immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-82a035" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus symptoms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1eb627" class="body-graf"&gt;Norovirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious&lt;/a&gt;, human-only disease. Norovirus outbreaks can happen anywhere and cause around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;20 million infections&lt;/a&gt; a year. It’s responsible for over half of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-089da0" class="body-graf"&gt;It spreads from person to person through vomit or feces drops that end up in peoples’ mouths. It can also spread through coming in contact with contaminated food, water or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419a39" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;main symptoms &lt;/a&gt;are diarrhea and vomiting, earning it the name “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-treatment-guide-effective-methods-protection-rcna185872" target="_blank"&gt;two-bucket disease&lt;/a&gt;.” Other symptoms include fever, stomach pain and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac533" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea may require medical attention for older adults, young children and people with weakened immune systems, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4a90c" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually start within 12 to 48 hours after exposure and last for a few days. Someone can still spread the virus for more than two weeks, even after symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-687185" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect against norovirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus is notoriously difficult to kill. &lt;/a&gt;It’s difficult to wash away and can survive temperatures up to 145°F.

&lt;p&gt;For almost 30 years, GNN has been busting global media’s 24-hour gloom and doom cycle with the premise that bad news doesn’t have to sell, and good news isn’t rare at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case-in-point for this outlet’s publishing mission is a &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; recently released on Our World in Data that showed how bad news events like murder and terrorism are extraordinarily over-covered by American media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, homicide receives approximately 4,300% more media coverage than its share of deaths across the American population every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put differently, if every death in America was reported on, news stories on homicides would be fewer in number by a factor of 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study the same is true for terrorism—by a staggering 18,000 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relying on Media Cloud, an open-access platform for media analysis, the team behind the study analyzed news headlines covering the 12 most-common causes of death in America, plus homicide, drug overdoses, and terrorism, as these were perceived by the authors to receive an outsized share of media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then gathered news stories from three of the largest news outlets in America: the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the news website of Fox News. Their criteria was set to ensure the stories focused on these causes of death as the topic, rather than in passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heart disease and cancer accounted for 56% of deaths among these 15 causes, but together they received just 7% of the media coverage,” the study team, consisting of Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, found and wrote in their presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rare—but dramatic—events such as homicides and terrorism received more than half of all media coverage,” despite together representing less than 1% of all deaths in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_226012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226012" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-226012" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1024x677.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-326x215.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-768x507.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-696x460.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1068x706.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-636x420.jpg 636w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-530x350.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License.jpg 1135w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226012" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;– credit, Ritchie et al on CC-BY License&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug overdoses were also overrepresented—by 4-times their share of mortality events in the American population. Suicide was overrepresented by 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nearly six-in-ten Americans still see international terrorism as a critical threat to the United States, despite the domestic impact on the US being relatively low for two decades,” the authors write. Indeed, terrorism killed just 16 Americans last year, about half the number of Americans killed in &lt;a href="https://www.thedoanlawfirm.com/elevator-accidents-can-cause-significant-injuries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;elevator accidents&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not thinking twice about climbing into a rickety elevator, than you probably shouldn’t overly worry about terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAK THE BAD NEWS CYCLE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Instead of ‘We Are What We Eat,’ the Science of Kindness Says ‘We Are What We See’ in Daily Life" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/science-of-kindness-says-we-are-what-we-see/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Instead of ‘We Are What We Eat,’ the Science of Kindness Says ‘We Are What We See’ in Daily Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t appear to be down to a conspiracy in media, but rather because American reporters are just following the absolute basics of ‘storytelling’. Heart disease and cardiovascular events kill 2,000 Americans every day, so the headline would be the same as yesterday’s and the day before that, with little variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dramatic event like a plane crash or a gun battle in an American downtown area, has eye-witnesses, dramatic recounting, and enough individual details to make a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE POSITIVE HEADLINES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Five Top Headlines that Showcase the World’s Progress in the Climate Fight" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/top-five-2023-headlines-that-showcase-world-progress-on-climate-crisis-renewables-emissions-evs/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Five Top Headlines that Showcase the World’s Progress in the Climate Fight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritchie, Acisu, and Mathieu write that the vast majority of news consumers cite a motivation to be better informed, and to keep track of what’s happening in the world, as the reasons for their attention to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s clear that the number of news stories on a topic doesn’t actually reflect the overall state of a society, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking it does, and feel depressed because you’re led to believe life is full of malicious, despairing savagery.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many cancer doctors hope that tests like Galleri, which are sometimes called &lt;a href="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;“liquid biopsies,”&lt;/a&gt; will transform cancer care by detecting the earliest signs of malignancy, enabling treatment before the disease becomes deadly. They are part of an accelerating effort to find cancer earlier and earlier, through blood tests as well as new techniques and artificial intelligence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The goal is to take the same energy and skill that has been deployed to develop treatments for cancer, and put it to work at finding cancer early enough to stop it in its tracks, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How do we move from a reactive model where we are only picking up cancers when they declare themselves?” she said. O’Donnell is leading &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/clinical-trials/24-070" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of the Galleri test, recruiting 1,000 people at high risk for cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today, 70 percent of cancers have no screening test. People can be screened for cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and, for heavy smokers, lung. Other tumors often grow without symptoms and are discovered when it’s too late to effectively treat them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The path to catching more cancers early is fraught with challenges. To be most effective, screening has to do more than just detect cancer: It has to find the right cancer at the right moment. When a test turns up cancer so indolent it was never going to harm the patient, it only sows fear and can lead to needless procedures. When it finds a cancer that is so aggressive there’s no stopping it, its value can be limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You really want a screening test that finds the cancer and leads to the patient not dying,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, a noted expert in cancer prevention and control at Johns Hopkins University, who has consulted for GRAIL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When Burns White, 66, of Randolph, returned from the jazz festival, she was not immediately concerned. She’d been told that more often than not, a positive result from Galleri proves to be a false alarm. Her primary care doctor told her not to worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the result was pretty specific: It said cancer might be lurking in her breast, esophagus, and stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So Burns White consulted with doctors from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she works in community outreach and engagement. Two years ago, the hospital launched its &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/early-detection-interception" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Early Detection and Interception&lt;/a&gt;, which works with patients at high risk of cancer, those who receive troubling results from liquid biopsies, and others who learn of hard-to-interpret abnormalities from tests done for another purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White endured an endoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure involving threading a tube with a camera down her throat. The result was good news: no cancer of the esophagus or stomach. It would be a different story for breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A mammogram she had taken a few months before had detected masses — but they looked benign. The results of the GRAIL test “pushed us to look closer,” said O’Donnell, of Dana-Farber. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White underwent another set of mammograms, followed by MRIs and biopsies of both breasts. Doctors told her she had triple-negative breast cancer, a form that can be difficult to treat but that was still at an early stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Multicancer blood tests eventually will “change the face of early detection for cancer,” said Timothy R. Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But they still need more work because, while they catch some cancers at an early stage, others are missed, he said. And even a screening tool that saves lives can have costs: follow-up testing and sometimes needless treatment, as well as “the psychosocial costs of having to go through all of this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Recent preliminary &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/presentation/list?q=Galleri" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;results from the largest study of GRAIL’s Galleri test&lt;/a&gt; showed its promise and limitations. Galleri found many types of cancer for which there is no screening test, and 92 percent of the time it correctly identified where in the body the cancer originated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test was administered to 36,000 people aged 50 and older. Among the first 25,000 analyzed, Galleri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found a “cancer signal” in 216 cases — and cancer was confirmed in 133, about 60 percent. That compares favorably with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq#_80_toc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt;, said Megan P. Hall, vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL; she cited data showing that when a woman is called back for a follow-up mammogram, only 4 to 5 percent turn out to have cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were more false negatives than true positives — 196 people were told the test found no cancer but went on to develop it within the next year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, even though its purpose is early detection, nearly half the cancer cases the test found were already advanced. That’s because advanced cancers shed more DNA and are easier to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The endgame in early detection may come down to better defining who is most at risk and thus most likely to benefit from screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, pancreatic cancer is almost always detected at an advanced stage. But it’s so rare that it would make no sense to screen everybody. Researchers are looking for ways to identify a subset of high-risk people who would benefit from screening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/24/metro/ai-predict-pancreatic-cancer/?p1" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;deploying AI&lt;/a&gt; to comb through the medical records of millions of patients, looking for patterns common among those who went on to develop pancreatic cancers, such as changes in blood chemistry or more frequent doctor’s visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Dana-Farber, researchers have identified one possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer: muscle loss. By studying blood samples from people who developed pancreatic cancer going back years before their diagnosis, and also looking at CT scans, researchers led by Dr. Brian Wolpin and Dr. Michael H. Rosenthal found evidence that the pancreas starts to falter, performing its key functions less well, long before any tumor forms. This weakens the body’s ability to absorb proteins in the diet, causing it to break down muscle. But many factors can cause muscle loss, so further study is needed before these measures can be put to use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors are working on a warning system for lung cancer. An AI program called Sybil scanned thousands of chest X-rays of people who were later diagnosed with the disease and learned the patterns seen before someone develops cancer in the lung, said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director of the &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/cancer-early-detection" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“My vision for 25 years from now,” said Dana-Farber’s O’Donnell, “is that when you go to your primary care physician’s appointment, they say, ‘This is your risk score, and here are the screening tests you need.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who calls himself a “healthy skeptic” of cancer screening, would like to see the opposite: “If you want to lower the burden on patients,” he said, “develop the test that tells people they’re at low risk for cancer and [can] stop worrying about it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for Burns White, she’s happy with how the Galleri test played out for her. Once her breast cancer was diagnosed, she underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Today, a little over a year since her diagnosis, she continues to take a medication aimed at eradicating the remaining cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through it all, Burns White continued to work, taking off only a few days for the surgery. She expects her treatment to end in mid-December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I remain strong and optimistic,” she said, “and grateful to have had access to treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Instead of starting when joint pain becomes noticeable, the disease quietly builds over many years. RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that leads to inflammation and damage in the joints.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to new research, people who are at higher risk for RA undergo major changes in their immune system well before symptoms surface. Their bodies are already engaged in an unseen autoimmune struggle during this early, silent period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multi-Institution Study Maps RA's Hidden Early Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Allen Institute, CU Anschutz, University of California San Diego, and the Benaroya Research Institute worked together to uncover these early immune changes. Their findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, offer the most detailed view to date of how RA takes shape. By charting immune activity in individuals at risk, the team showed that the disease process is already underway long before joint problems are noticeable. These insights may help guide earlier intervention and possibly prevent disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, we hope this study raises awareness that rheumatoid arthritis begins much earlier than previously thought and that it enables researchers to make data-driven decisions on strategies to disrupt disease development," said Mark Gillespie, Ph.D., assistant investigator at the Allen Institute and co-senior author with Kevin Deane (CU Anschutz), M.D./Ph.D.; Adam Savage (Allen Institute), Ph.D.; Troy Torgerson (Allen Institute), M.D./Ph.D.; and Gary S. Firestein (UC San Diego), M.D. The research followed individuals with ACPA antibodies over seven years. These antibodies are well-established biomarkers for those at risk for RA. During the study, the team uncovered previously unrecognized contributors to disease progression, including widespread inflammation, immune system malfunction, and shifts in how certain immune cells function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward the findings from this study will support additional studies to identify ways to better predict who will get RA, identify potential biologic targets for preventing RA as well as identify ways to improve treatments for those with existing RA," said Kevin Deane, M.D./Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; The researchers observed that people at risk for RA already showed signs of systemic inflammation throughout the body. This inflammation was not limited to the joints. Instead, it resembled the body-wide inflammatory pattern commonly seen in individuals with active RA.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cell dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple immune cell types showed unusual behavior.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which normally create protective antibodies, were found in a heightened pro-inflammatory state.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T helper cells&lt;/strong&gt;, especially those similar to Tfh17 cells, had expanded far beyond typical levels. These cells help coordinate immune responses, including the creation of autoantibodies (antibodies that attack the body's own tissues). Their expansion helps explain why the immune system begins targeting healthy tissue.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most striking discoveries was that even "naive" T cells, which have not yet encountered pathogens, showed epigenetic changes. Although their DNA sequence remained intact, the regulation of their genes had shifted. This altered gene activity suggests these cells were being reprogrammed before encountering any threats.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint-like inflammation detected in blood:&lt;/strong&gt; The team also found that monocytes (a type of white blood cell) circulating in the bloodstream were producing high amounts of inflammatory molecules. Remarkably, these cells closely resembled the macrophages typically found in the inflamed joints of RA patients, indicating that the immune system was already setting the stage for joint inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Early Detection and Preventive Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight new early-warning indicators (biomarkers and immune signatures) that could help doctors determine which at-risk individuals are most likely to develop RA. Identifying the disease during this hidden phase may make it possible to monitor patients more closely and begin treatment earlier. If this process is caught in time, RA may be prevented before joint damage begins -- potentially sparing patients years of pain and disability. The research supports a shift from reacting to joint damage after it appears to preventing RA at its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that, in 28 days, people in the urolithin A group had changes in biomarkers associated with age-related immune decline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A leads to better cell function, but it also has a positive impact on muscle,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://georg-speyer-haus.de/en/forschung/forschungsgruppen/prof-dr-florian-greten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florian Greten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florian Greten&lt;/a&gt;, MD, researcher and director of the Georg-Speyer-Haus Institut für Tumorbiologie. (Separate early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests urolithin A has the potential to enhance muscle health and performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greten says it’s “exciting” that he and other researchers were able to detect these positive changes within a month. “We don’t know yet if you can take a lower amount and get a similar impact, but we are studying that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urolithin A is a bioactive compound that’s produced in the gut when certain compounds (mostly ellagitannins and ellagic acid) are broken down by specific gut bacteria, explains Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: Not everyone produces urolithin A efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that only about 40 percent of people have the right gut microbiome for this,” Dr. Greten says. If you don’t have the "right" microbiome, meaning you're missing certain necessary bacteria, your gut won’t produce this compound efficiently through foods, he says, adding that there’s no publicly available test to see if you have these bacteria or not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, urolithin A supplements can theoretically work despite missing certain bacteria since it doesn't need to be converted, Dr. Greten says. Remember: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement, including urolithin A, especially if you have preexisting medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Dr. Greten's study, here’s some additional preliminary research swirling around urolithin A. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Early research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Early research&lt;/a&gt; indicates urolithin A may support healthy aging by enhancing how your cells produce and recycle energy,” says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Some small human &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest it could improve muscle endurance and aspects of immune function, but the research is still preliminary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research surrounding urolithin A involves supplements, but certain foods may spark a process in your body that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; urolithin A. “It’s not found in large amounts in food, but your body creates it after you eat foods that are rich in these precursor compounds,” Cording says. (But Cording stresses that your individual microbiome plays a big role in whether or not your body can do this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those foods include &lt;strong&gt;pomegranate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;raspberries&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;blackberries&lt;/strong&gt;. “Eating these foods regularly may help, but the amount of urolithin A you generate varies from person to person,” she says, even if you do have the "right" bacteria to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have the right microbiome, eating and drinking these foods can lead to the production of urolithin A,” Dr. Greten says. But even then, you’d need to have a lot of these foods—Dr. Greten says you’d need to have 1.5 liters of pomegranate juice a day to mimic the effects of the supplement used in his study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately experts say that more research is needed around urolithin A. In the meantime, there are other things you can do to support longevity. “Don’t overlook lifestyle approaches to supporting healthy mitochondrial function, such as eating a well-balanced diet rich in &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, exercising, prioritizing restful sleep, and managing stress,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:39:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNdnJWZG5zMnNNQkhhdWRBdncyNENjNUY2T2NNN3pNS0w2VF9JU0VxLUI4aV9YTTRGNDI4Ql9oV1gwSFBsd210X1JpX1dfUXY3QkpkMUhCS2lBOTZOU1VsaFFCdmFUWmxoNnNFT3ZfUEo1N0VvRm1zLXpYRlVXWHp1U0pvQzRrSTdW</guid></item><item><title>NSD2靶向逆转前列腺癌的可塑性和耐药性-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09727-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec9-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10"&gt;Mouse procedures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPp53 mice were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6-129Sv background and have been previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Zou, M. et al.

For heterogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1 and NPPO-5, organoid culture medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of homogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1NE, NPPO-2, NPPO-4 and NPPO-6, we used neuroendocrine organoid culture medium, which was identical to the organoid culture medium except that no EGF was added; the medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of non-neuroendocrine NPPO organoids (NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO8 and NPPO9), we used the standard organoid culture medium.

After neutralization with 10 ml PBS, cells were spun down and counted, with approximately 50,000 cells plated per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates (Corning, 3474). To generate cryopreserved stocks, organoids were frozen in 90% CS-FBS and 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. We considered neuroendocrine organoid lines to be successfully established when they could be stably passaged, cryopreserved and recovered without loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes.

Human prostate tumour organoids were maintained in 80% Matrigel in human neuroendocrine culture medium, which was replaced every other day. Human neuroendocrine culture medium consisted of human hepatocyte culture medium (LifeNet Health LifeSciences, MED-HHCM-500ML), human hepatocyte culture medium supplement (LifeNet Health LifeSciences, MED-HHCMS), 5% CS-FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; EGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PHG0311), 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; primocin and 10 nM DHT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;H&amp;amp;E staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For tissue processing and embedding, organoids were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-4) for 1 h, washed once with PBS, placed in rat tail collagen I (Corning, 354249) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The collagen button was then put into a biopsy cassette (Fisher Scientific, 15182705E) and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. After replacing the formalin with 70% ethanol, the cassettes were put into an automated tissue processor for tissue processing and embedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned into 5-µm sections using a microtome and dried onto microscope slides at room temperature. Paraffin sections were baked at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization with 3 changes of xylene (5 min each). The slides were hydrated through 100%, 95% and 95% ethanol, 5 min each, rinsed in tap water for 2 min and incubated in Gill Hematoxylin 3 (Epredia, 72611) for 3–30 min. Slides were rinsed in tap water and dipped 3–5 times in 0.5% acid alcohol (Leica Biosystems, 3803651), followed by rinsing in tap water and bluing with Scott’s Tap Water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 2607007) for 5 min. After rinsing in tap water, slides were incubated in 95% ethanol for 5 min and counterstained with eosin (StatLab, S1761GL) for 1–3 min. Slides were passed through 70%, 95% and 100% (3 times) ethanol, rinsed 3 times in xylene and coverslipped with mounting medium (StatLab, MMC0126). Images were captured using an Olympus BX 61 VS slide scanner, and image acquisition was performed using Olympus VS-ASW (v.2.5) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin sections (5 µm) were dried onto microscope slides at room temperature, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization through 3 changes of xylene (5 min each), hydrated in 100%, 95%, 95% and 75% ethanol (5 min each) and washed in tap water for 2 min. Antigen retrieval was performed through immersion in boiling citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min, cooling to room temperature for 30 min and incubation in Milli-Q water at room temperature for 10 min. Sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (MilliporeSigma, 11332481001) for 10 min and blocked in 10% goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50062Z) for 1 h. Primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) were added to sections and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific D1306) for 5 min. Slides were washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield Antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories H-1200-10). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF v.2.6.0) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;scRNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scRNA-seq, NPPO-1, NPPO-2, NPPO-4, NPPO-5 and NPPO-6 organoids were analysed at passage 2. Organoids were dissociated by incubation with pre-warmed TrypLE at 37 °C for 10 min, neutralization with 1:10 5% CS-FBS–PBS, centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and filtration 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning 431750). Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, pellets were dissociated with 5% CS-FBS–PBS and resuspended at 1,000 cells per µl after counting using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Libraries were prepared using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent kit (v3.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Approximately 5,000 cells were loaded onto a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) to generate gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), and barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA was generated and amplified by PCR. Chromium Gene Expression libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and scRNA-seq data were processed using Cell Ranger software (10x Genomics, v.2.1.1 for MJ002 and MJ004; v.3.0.2 for MJ005, MJ007, MJ008 and MJ012; v.5.0.1 for MJ014 and MJ015; see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM7"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core.

Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec 130-091-376) were used for single nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml chilled wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in a Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS and 0.1% Tween-20 in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1% BAS in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Approximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium Controller at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-nucleus ATAC–seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v.1.1, 10X Genomics). In brief, nuclei were transposed and partitioned into GEMs. 10x barcodes were added to index the transposed DNA of each individual nucleus. Libraries were generated by PCR and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Paired-end sequencing data were processed with Cell Ranger ATAC (v.1.0.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Quality control metrics are provided in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM11"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Isolation of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells from NPPO-1 organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sort neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine populations, NPPO-1 organoids at passage 2 were incubated with prewarmed TrypLE at 37 °C for 10 min, neutralized with 1:10 PBS and 5% CS-FBS, spun at 1,000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended with PBS and dissociated into single cells by gentle pipetting. The cells were filtered 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning, 431750), spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended with PBS and 2% CS-FBS. After filtering through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm strainer cap (Corning 352235), cell numbers were counted in a TC20 automated cell counter, and the volume was adjusted to a final cell concentration of 5,000 cells per µl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow sorting was performed on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124) at the Flow Cytometry Core of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. Gating by forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) was used to exclude debris, and doublets were excluded by gating on trigger pulse width against FSC height. Individual neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells were sorted based on scatter parameters. Neuroendocrine tumour cells have less internal complexity (granularity) than non-neuroendocrine tumour cells and exhibit lower intensity SSC. Flow sorting data were collected and analysed using BD FACS software (BD Biosciences, v.1.2.0.142). Cell purity was assessed after flow sorting by scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Lineage tracing in organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow-sorted neuroendocrine cells from NPPO-1 organoids were maintained in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel. Half of the flow-sorted non-neuroendocrine cells were used for scRNA-seq (Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core) immediately after sorting. The other non-neuroendocrine cells were transfected with H2B-RFP (Addgene, 26001) lentivirus. Approximately 70% of non-neuroendocrine cells were labelled with H2B-RFP at 3 days after transfection, in the absence of antibiotic selection. On day 7, the cells were digested with TrypLE and passed 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer to ensure a single-cell suspension, followed by cell counting. For co-culture, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded together with neuroendocrine cells at a ratio of 2:3 in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates; as a control, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded alone. The resulting organoids were cultured in organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel and analysed at passage 4 by immunostaining and scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Imaging of histone and DNA modifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To screen for differential expression of histone modifications between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells in NPPO-1 organoids, we performed immunofluorescence staining with antibodies that detect the neuroendocrine markers SYP or CHGA, the non-neuroendocrine marker VIM, and various histone and DNA modifications (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were acquired using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (LAS AF v.2.6.0). Fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ (NIH; v.1.52K) using three parameters: area, integrated density (IntDen) and mean grey value. The background was measured from a region that had no fluorescence on the same image. Intensity was calculated using the formula: Intensity = IntDen – (area &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\times \)&lt;/span&gt; mean fluorescence of background readings). Measurements were collected from three independent organoids, and results were plotted using Prism 9 (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used to compare means, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated from two-tailed &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Analysis of &lt;i&gt;NSD2&lt;/i&gt; expression in human datasets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate differences in gene expression of &lt;i&gt;NSD1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; NSD2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NSD3&lt;/i&gt; in human prostate tumour samples, we analysed bulk RNA-seq from 49 patients with CRPC (15 CRPC-NE and 34 CRPC-Adeno) from a published dataset&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Beltran, H. et al.

After washing 3 times with Dig-300 buffer, the beads were resuspended in 150 µl Tagmentation buffer (Dig-300 buffer with 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stop tagmentation and to solubilize DNA fragments, 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9260G), 1.5 µl 10% SDS (MilliporeSigma, 71736) and 1.25 µl 20 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0491) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The next day, phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15593049) was used to extract nucleic acids. DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol (MilliporeSigma, E7023) and dissolved in 25 μl RNase-free water. To remove RNA contamination before library preparation, DNA samples were incubated with 25 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) at 37 °C for 10 min. Library DNAs were amplified by PCR using Illumina universal i5 primers, Nextera barcoded i7 primers (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM12"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) and NEBNext HiFi 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs, M0541). The PCR conditions were as follows: cycle 1: 72 °C for 5 min; cycle 2: 98 °C for 30 s; cycle 3: 98 °C for 10 s; cycle 4: 63 °C for 10 s, repeating 14 times, followed by 72 °C for 1 min and hold at 8 °C. Post-PCR clean-up was performed using 1:1 volume Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880). Samples were dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8; MilliporeSigma, T2694) for sequencing. Size distribution and concentration of libraries were determined by capillary electrophoresis using a 4200 TapeStation (Agilent). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed on pooled libraries, with 10–12 million reads per library, using an Illumina HiSeq system.

Scaling factors for spike-in normalization were determined by the ratio between the number of reads aligned to the mouse genome and the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genome. Potential PCR duplicates were removed by the markdup function of sambamba (v.1.0.1). Peak calling was performed using SEACR (v.1.3) or MACS2 (v.2.2.8) with IgG input as control. Intersect function of bedtools (v.2.27.1) was used to identify H3K27ac enhancers corresponding to H3K27ac peaks not overlapping promoters and found in broader H3K36me2 domains. Motif analysis was performed using the simple enrichment analysis function from MEME suit (v.5.5.7) with the JASPAR 2022 Core motif database&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Rauluseviciute, I. et al.

Heatmap and enrichment plots of H3K36me2, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 or H3K27ac over H3K36me2 or H3K27ac peaks were generated using the computeMatrix (reference- point, - a 5000 - b 5000) and plotHeatmap functions implemented in DeepTools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-seq reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT2 (v.2.1.0). The mapped reads count of each gene was measured by featureCounts (v.1.6.1). The RNA-seq read count matrix was combined with the CUT&amp;amp;Tag signal read count matrix for all gene loci in R (v.4.1.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Lentivirus production and transfection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentiviruses were generated by the transfection of 293T cells with the indicated expression plasmid and the psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pVSV.G (Addgene, 14888) packaging vectors at a ratio of 4:2:3, respectively. Viral supernatants were collected at 48, 72 and 96 h after transfection, filtered and concentrated using a Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232). For CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout, we used the lentiCas9-blast plasmid (Addgene, 52962) and a custom vector for sgRNA (U6-sgRNA-EFS-Puro-P2A-TurboRFP in a pLL3-based lentiviral backbone; gift from S. Lowe). For sgRNA design, the CRISPick platform (BROAD institute) was used. HA-tagged H3.3K36M was overexpressed in the pCDH vector (gift from D. Allis). The following sgRNAs were used in the experiment: sgControl, 5′ GAG ATA AGC ATT ATA ATT CCT 3′; sgNsd2 (mouse): 5′ TCA GGG TCT CAC AAT TGG GC 3′; sgNSD2 (human): 5′ GCA CCA GCT CAC GTT GAC GT 3′.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transfection, organoids were incubated with high-titre lentivirus in culture medium supplemented with 8 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene (MilliporeSigma, TR-1003). Medium containing virus was removed on the next day and switched to normal organoid medium with Matrigel. Selection with appropriate antibiotics was performed at 3 days after transfection for 7–14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Multiplexed staining of TMAs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary antibodies were tested on prostate tumour samples to verify the expected pattern of staining and were titrated at four concentrations to determine the best signal-to-noise ratio. Multiplexed staining was performed using an Opal 6-plex detection kit (Akoya Biosciences, NEL871001KT) on a Bond Rx Research Stainer (Leica Biosystems), adding DAPI as a nuclear marker. Slides were imaged using a Vectra Polaris Automated Quantitative Pathology Multispectral Imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). Exposure times were optimized under the constraint that no pixel saturated the detector. These studies were conducted under protocols approved by Weill Cornell Medical Center. All patients with prostate cancer or their families provided informed consent for research use of biospecimens and clinical data under an institutional approved protocol (IRB #1008011210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Analysis of patient survival curves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the association of NSD2 with overall survival in mCRPC, two independent mCRPC biopsy RNA-seq cohorts were used: (1) a cohort of 159 mCRPC transcriptomes generated by the PCF–SU2C Prostate Cancer Dream Team&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Abida, W. et al.

Tissue segmentation of the images was performed using a deep-learning classifier by training the algorithm ‘DenseNet V2’ from the Halo AI plug-in (Indica Labs, v.3.6), using only the DAPI channel as information for the training. Eight different classes were defined for both tissue segmentation and quality control issues: background, stroma, malignant tumour, benign glands, necrosis, liver tissue, decalcified tissue and out-of-focus regions. The performance of the classifier was evaluated by a pathologist (F.S.) to ensure that the majority of tissue compartments were properly classified. Cell segmentation was performed using a pre-trained deep-learning model already present in Halo AI (‘nuclei seg’) and applied to the DAPI channel only. Using the module ‘analysis’ in the Halo software, all the biomarkers were then quantified using the segmentation algorithms to generate a counts matrix representing the average expression of each marker in each cell. Thresholding for each marker was performed using a Gaussian mixture model of statistically robust cut-off values for low versus high intensity of the markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for the precise nuclei or cytoplasmic marker locations from the immunofluorescence intensities were mapped for each TMA core. The coordinate point location was taken for multiple-localization analysis in different classes of markers. There are M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; classes of markers, for which each class is composed of a different combination of markers. For any given combination of markers, M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; (each composed of nuclei or cytoplasm as detected with thresholds on their intensities), we classified a given nucleus or cytoplasm NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; coordinate, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; in [1, …,&lt;i&gt; i&lt;/i&gt;], belonging to M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; class. We repeated this process for each NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; in M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; to form a distribution of multiple localizations in the different classes of markers, C&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. Measures for C&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; were recorded for each TMA core sample and normalized using the total number of NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; belonging to M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; class per patient. For any given marker, M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, we also measured the overall distribution at the single-localization level. The mean value for the measures was implemented by Welch ANOVA or unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (two-tailed) in Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Flow sorting of transfected cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout experiments, organoids were transfected with the lentiCas9-blast plasmid and blasticidin selection to establish stable lines. A custom vector for the sgRNA lentivirus carrying a TurboRFP reporter and puromycin antibiotic was then transfected into the Cas9-expressing organoids. After 14 days of antibiotic selection, we performed FACS on the PE channel to sort RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124), as described above. Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) for single-nucleus isolation and multiome ATAC–seq (10x Genomics). Additional collected RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were used for organoid culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments in which mouse neuroendocrine tumour organoids were transfected with an HA-tagged H3.3K36M lentiviral vector, we performed flow cytometry at 14 days after antibiotic selection to determine the purity of the culture. Organoids were dissociated into single cells and resuspended in 100 µl 4% paraformaldehyde (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells) to fix for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were neutralized with 1 ml PBS, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS. The cells were permeabilized for 10 min by the addition of 0.5 ml 1% Triton-X100 with gentle vortexing to a final concentration of 0.5% Triton-X100. Cells were washed in 10 ml PBS and resuspended with 100 µl Cy5.5-conjugated mouse anti-HA-Tag antibody (clone 6E2, Cell Signaling Technology, 62145) diluted 1:50 in 0.5% BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated with antibody for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, washed twice in 0.5% BSA, resuspended in 300 µl 0.5% BSA and filtered through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm cell strainer cap. Flow cytometry was performed on the APC channel using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) as described above, using Cy5.5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; events to determine the percentage of HA-Tag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Flow data were analysed using FlowJo (BD, v.10.8.2). The same batch of cells was collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS for single-nucleus isolation and multiome single-nucleus ATAC–seq and snRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Single-nucleus multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids were digested into single cells using TrypLE, passed through a 40-µm cell strainer 3 times, and cell numbers were quantified using an automated cell counter. Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) were used for single-nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in the Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT (MilliporeSigma, 646563) and 1 U µl&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor (MilliporeSigma, 3335399001) in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1 mM DTT, 1 U µl&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL Automated cell counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium X Controller (10x Genomics) at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome Reagent kit, 10x Genomics). In brief, nucleus suspensions were transposed and adapters added to the ends of the DNA fragments. Single Cell Multiome ATAC + GEX Gel Beads include a poly(dT) sequence that enables production of barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA for the gene expression (GEX) library and a spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for the ATAC library. The GEMs were generated by combining barcoded gel beads, transposed nuclei and a master mix. Barcoded transposed DNA and barcoded full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA were amplified by PCR. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and data were processed using Cell Ranger ARC (10x Genomics, v.1.0.0 for MJ018, MJ019, MJ020, MJ021, MJ022 and MJ023; v.2.0.2 for MJ024 and MJ025; see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM7"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core.

Cells were resuspended in 5% Matrigel in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium lacking DHT and plated in triplicate at a seeding density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates. The next day, 7 doses of enzalutamide in 0.1% DMSO were dispensed at 1.5-fold dilution from 1 µM to 11.25 µM. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega G9683), and luminescence was measured using a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Background luminescence was measured in medium without cells. The percentage of viable cells was calculated using the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\rm{V}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}\,{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{s}}\,({\rm{ \% }})=\frac{{\rm{E}}{\rm{x}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}\,{\rm{v}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{e}}-{\rm{b}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{k}}{\rm{g}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{d}}\,{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{g}}}{{\rm{V}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{h}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}\,{\rm{v}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{e}}-{\rm{b}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{k}}{\rm{g}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{d}}\,{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{g}}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug–response curves were generated by nonlinear regression using the percentage of viable cells against the logarithm of drug concentrations using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were calculated by the equation log (inhibitor) versus response (variable slope, four parameters). Two-way ANOVA was used to compare dose–response curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar methods were used to determine response of mouse or human organoids to defined doses of enzalutamide, using 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human). The percentage of viable cells from different treatment groups were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used to compare means between two groups.

A 10 μl reaction system was assembled with 25 nM lysine methyltransferase enzyme (or enzyme complex), 0.5 µM SAM, 100 nM mononucleosome (EpiCypher), MTase-Glo reagent (1×) and a series of diluted NSD2i in reaction buffer (containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10% glycerol) in a white 384-well microplate (Corning). NSD2i was serially diluted from 30 μM to 0 μM in threefold concentrations. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, 10 μl MTase-Glo Detection solution was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were detected by luminescence, and the relative activity of enzymes calculated with the initial data. IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were analysed using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;NSD2i treatment of organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pretreated mouse and human organoids with NSD2i for 12 or 21 days, respectively, before 5 days of co-treatment with NSD2i and enzalutamide. Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well (mouse) in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium without DHT in a 96-well low-attachment dish with 5% Matrigel (mouse) or as a total of 25,000 cells (human) in a 50 µl 80% Matrigel button in human neuroendocrine culture medium without DHT. DMSO or NSD2i at concentrations ranging from 0.3 µM to 10 µM were added on the day of plating and replenished every other day. Following pretreatment, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. The next day, DMSO or the same concentration of NSD2i were dispensed together with enzalutamide at threefold dilutions ranging from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega, G9683), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To detect apoptotic cell death, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. DMSO (negative control), 10 µM bortezomib (Cayman Chemical, 10008822) as a positive control or NSD2i was dispensed together with a threefold dilution series of enzalutamide from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Apoptotic cell death was assayed after 24–48 h treatment using a Caspase-Glo(R) 3/7 3D assay (Promega, G8981), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Luminescence values were first normalized to the DMSO-treated controls and then compared with 10 µM bortezomib treatment, which induces 100% apoptotic cell death after 24 or 48 h. The resulting signals normalized to a percentage of maximal response were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate epigenomic changes after drug treatment, non-neuroendocrine NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO-8 and NPPO-9 organoids were seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. On the day after seeding, DMSO, 1 µM enzalutamide or the combination of 1 µM enzalutamide and 1 µM NSD2i was added into the culture medium and replenished every other day. On day 40 after treatment, organoids were collected for fixation by 10% formalin for immunofluorescence staining or for flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen for western blot analysis. Western blotting for AR protein using the antibody listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; was performed using the methods described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;DHT agonist treatment of organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether NSD2 targeting restores AR activity, NPPO-1NE, NPPO-2 and MSKPCa10 organoids transfected with sgControl or sgNsd2 were cultured in organoid culture medium without DHT for three passages. The organoids were then dissociated and seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. One day after seeding, 100 nM DHT or DMSO was added to the medium and replenished every other day. Cell numbers were counted every other day using a TC20 automated cell counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Multidrug synergy analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyse synergy between NSD2i and enzalutamide, the multidose combination response data generated from CellTiter-Glo 3D assays were input into SynergyFinder (v.3.0; &lt;a href="https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi"&gt;https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi&lt;/a&gt;), a web application for interactive analysis and visualization of multidrug combination response data.

NOD/SCID mice underwent surgical castration at 7 days before grafting. For mouse grafts, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; dissociated organoid cells in 100 µl hepatocyte culture medium and 5% Matrigel were subcutaneously injected into the flank using a 1 ml syringe with a 25 G needle (BD, 305122). For human grafts, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; dissociated cells in 100 µl 60% Matrigel and 40% hepatocyte culture medium were injected. Tumour sizes were measured with a digital caliper. Mice were randomly assigned to cohorts for treatment. In each cohort, 20–24 mice whose tumour volume had reached about 250 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (mouse grafts) or 80 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (human grafts) at week 2 after grafting received either 10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; enzalutamide (TargetMol, T6002) or 0.5% DMSO (MilliporeSigma, D2650) by daily gavage through a 20 G needle (Roboz, FN-7910) for 14 days (mouse grafts) or 56 days (human grafts). Enzalutamide or DMSO was suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose (MilliporeSigma, 419281) and 0.1% Tween 80 (MilliporeSigma, P4780) in distilled water. At the end of drug treatment, tumours were collected and imaged under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX16) with digital camera (Olympus, DP71), and image acquisition was performed with an Olympus DP Controller (v.3.3.1). Investigators were blinded to data collection and analysis. Tumour sizes never exceeded the maximal limit of 8,000 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; permitted by the IACUC at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Tumour tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 24–48 h and processed at the Columbia Molecular Pathology Core Facility.

To generate human prostate organoid grafts, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; dissociated cells in 100 µl 60% Matrigel and 40% human hepatocyte culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the flank of castrated NOD/SCID male mice. To access NSD2i potency and specificity in vivo, 12 mice grafted with WCM1262 organoid cells with a tumour volume of about 100 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 3 weeks after grafting received 75 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, 150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; or 300 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; NSD2i or 0.5% DMSO by daily gavage through a 20 G needle for 5 days. Tumours were then collected and dissociated into single cells for western blot analyses of histone marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate response to NSD2i and enzalutamide, we used cohorts of 24 mice for each organoid line examined. In each cohort, mice with a tumour volume of about 80–86 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 weeks after grafting received either 150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; NSD2i or 0.5% DMSO by daily gavage through a 20 G needle for 14 days. The 12 mice in the NSD2i treatment group were then subdivided into two groups for treatment with 150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; NSD2i alone or 150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; NSD2i with 10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; enzalutamide for another 4 weeks. The 12 mice from the DMSO control group were also subdivided for further treatment with DMSO or with 10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; enzalutamide for another 4 weeks. The tumours were collected and imaged using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX16) with a digital camera (Olympus DP71), using an Olympus DP Controller (Olympus, v.3.3.1.292).

For doublet detection and removal, we used the Scrublet (v.0.2.2) algorithm as implemented in scanpy, applied to each sample independently. Each sample was then subsampled by retaining 3,000 cells that passed quality control, using the ‘subsample’ function with random state set to 666 as implemented in scanpy.

&lt;p&gt;The prerecorded message stated that “a measles outbreak has occurred in our community,” instructing residents to get vaccinated, avoid public places if symptomatic, and to call Hatzoloh at 845-425-1600 for guidance, overwhelming the volunteer EMS organization with a sudden influx of non-emergency calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh of Rockland County confirmed to Monsey Scoop that the robocall was completely unauthorized, not coordinated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While measles is indeed a concern in various parts of the region, Hatzoloh emphasized that medical guidance, including vaccination questions, should be directed to personal physicians, not emergency hotlines intended for life-saving situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh further noted that their hotline was “bombarded with unnecessary calls” following the county-issued robocall, potentially delaying response to genuine emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders and residents alike expressed outrage that Rockland County disseminated a medical advisory using Hatzoloh’s name without permission, creating confusion and placing undue burden on a volunteer emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health concerns must always be taken seriously, and residents are urged to &lt;strong&gt;consult their doctors regarding vaccination, symptoms, and medical guidance&lt;/strong&gt;. But the county’s decision to issue a robocall in Hatzoloh’s name, without authorization, has raised significant questions about procedure, communication, and respect for community partners.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago we looked at &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/11/6/2351534/-Diabetes-News-Miracle-Fruit-Synsepalum-Dulcificum" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Miracle Fruit (Synsepalum Dulcificum)&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have a different fruit, also from China, of similar appearance, showing similar benefits in research on diabetic mice—Nitraria roborowskii Kom. The active chemical is NRK-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I read recently…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Science Daily]: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251107010302.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Rare desert berry could transform diabetes treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruit of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIH: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37801345/" target="_blank"&gt;Chemical Profiling of Nitraria roborowskii Kom. by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS and Their Hypolipidemic Effects in Vivo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nitraria tangutorum improves pancreatic resistance in type 2 diabetic mice via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway” by Wu Di, Xu Jiyu, Wang Luya, Wu Li, Li Jiaxin, Banma Cailang, Zhao Xiaohui, Zhang Dejun and Yue Huilan, 14 April 2025, &lt;em&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;DOI: 10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;Improvement Effect of Insulin Resistance of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria Roborowskii&lt;/em&gt; Kom in Type 2 Diabetic Mice via PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;To explore hypoglycemic effect of 95% ethanol fraction of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii &lt;/em&gt;Kom(NRK-C) and its possible mechanism evaluated in the type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHODS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The body weight, organ indices, blood glucose levels, serum biochemical indexes, as well as HE/PAS histopathological section were all analyzed to assess the hypoglycemic effect of NRK-C in T2DM mice induced by a high-fat diet(HFD) combined with six intraperitoneal injections of 35 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of streptozotocin(STZ). The Western blotting and immunofluorescence were further applied to determine the regulatory effect of NRK-C on key signaling proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The fasting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced after 7 weeks of administration of NRK-C. In addition, NRK-C could also significantly improve glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen levels, and lipid levels(total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein), and significantly reduced insulin resistance of diabetic mice, which played an important role in the antidiabetic effects. Further mechanism research demonstrated that phosphorylated PI3K expression was up-regulated and p-GSK3β expression was up-regulated after NRK-C intervention, indicating that NRK-C might exert a potential antidiabetic effect by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All these results suggested that NRK-C might improve T2DM and had the potential to be used as an adjunctive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="as015"&gt;
&lt;div id="sp0015"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kom (NRK), with high economic and ecological value, is mainly distributed in the Qaidam Basin, China. However, research on its chemical components and bioactivities is still rare. In this study, its chemical constituents (52) including 10 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloids, nine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/cyclopeptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;, three indole alkaloids, five pyrrole alkaloids, eight phenolic acids and 17 flavonoids were identified tentatively using UPLC-triple-TOF-MS/MS. Notablely, one new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloid and five new &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cyclic-peptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; were confirmed using MS/MS fragmentation pathways. In addition, experiments in vitro indicated that NRK-C had strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/maltase" target="_blank"&gt;maltase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sucrase" target="_blank"&gt;sucrase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitory activities (IC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 0.202 and 0.103 mg/mL, respectively). Polysaccharide tolerance experiments confirmed NRK-C (400 mg/kg) was associated with decreased postprandial blood glucose (PBG) in diabetic mice. These results suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nitraria" target="_blank"&gt;NRK&lt;/a&gt; fruit might be used as a functional ingredient in food products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The participants were scanned while watching short (ranging from 1 to 4.3 min in length) independent and Hollywood film clips that were concatenated into four videos of 11.9–13.7 min total length. Before each clip, and after the final clip was displayed, there were 20 s periods in which there was no auditory stimulation and only the word ‘REST’ presented on the screen. There were four separate functional runs, in which observers viewed each of the four separate videos. All four videos contained an identical 83 s ‘validation’ sequence at the end of the video that was later removed to ensure independent stimulation in each cross-validation fold. Audio was scaled to ensure that no video clips were too loud or quiet across sessions and was delivered by Sensimetric earbuds that provide high-quality acoustic stimulus delivery while attenuating scanner noise.

For each run, BOLD time-series data were then converted to percentage signal change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For purposes of cross-validation, we made training and test datasets from the full dataset. We removed the final 103 s of each functional run, which corresponded to the identical ‘validation’ sequence and final rest period at the end of each video run. Our training dataset therefore consisted of the concatenated data from the four functional runs with this final 103 s removed from each. The test dataset was created by concatenating the final 103 s from each run into a 412 s set of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All connective-field models were fit on the individual-participant data and for video watching these models were also fit to the data of an across time-course averaged (HCP average) participant.

In turn, preferences for positions on the visual field can be estimated by referencing the estimated connective-field V1 positions against the retinotopic map of V1 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig1"&gt;1a–c&lt;/a&gt;). Here we extend this approach by simultaneously modelling brain responses as deriving from connective fields on both the V1 and S1 surfaces. This requires defining both a V1 and S1 source region and their underlying topographic maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To define these V1 and S1 source regions, we defined subsurfaces (one for each hemisphere) from the full cortical mesh, containing the vertices of a multimodal parcellation of the HCP data for regions V1 and Brodmann area 3b&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Glasser, M.

We chose region 3b as it is the first cortical input stage for tactile processing and is the most topographically organized subregion of S1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a model retinotopic map for V1, we used data from a ‘retinotopic prior’ that defines participant-averaged parameters of preferred visual field position (eccentricity, polar angle) estimated from a population receptive field (pRF) analysis of the HCP data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Benson, N.

Thus every vertex in V1 was associated with an eccentricity and polar angle value that defined its preference for the corresponding position in the visual field. Using this data, the V1 subsurface was then curtailed to only include vertices within the region stimulated by the video display (within 8 degrees of visual angle (DVA) from the fovea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The known topographic organization of S1 is a somatotopic map, which is an approximately dorsomedially to ventrolaterally oriented gradient that runs from sensitivity to lower limbs to the upper limbs and face&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Saadon-Grosman, N., Loewenstein, Y. &amp;amp; Arzy, S.

In principle, one can approximate any arbitrary spatial pattern on the surface (that is, a connective field) through a linear combination of LBOEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate this approach and determine the number of LBOEs to use in our analysis, we conducted pilot analyses where we attempted to predict target Gaussian connective fields of varying sizes from linear combinations of LBOEs. These analyses indicated that for both V1 and S1, 200 LBOEs were sufficient to adequately predict connective fields with a sampling extent of 2 mm, which approximates the lower bound of the known sampling extent of extrastriate cortex from V1 (that is, in V2)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Haak, K.

Reconstruction performance was at near-ceiling levels for sampling extents of 4 mm and above (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig7"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig8"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and increasing the number of LBOEs from 200 led to trivial increases in reconstruction performance relative to the increases in computation time. Furthermore, visualizing the performance of a 200 LBOE model in predicting connective fields centred on each V1 and S1 vertex revealed no systematic spatial inhomogeneities (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig7"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig8"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). As such we opted to use 200 LBOEs per subsurface in our connective-field modelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this approach validated, we generated model time courses for our design matrix via the dot product of the time-course data corresponding to each subsurface and each of the 200 corresponding LBOEs. Each model time course therefore reflects the sum of the timeseries data within the subsurface, weighted by one of the LBOEs (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). The model time courses were then &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scored over time and stacked to form a design matrix for model fitting. Thus, there were 800 regressors in our design matrix: 400 from V1 and 400 from S1 (200 per hemisphere), which were used to explain the BOLD responses during resting-state and video watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;Model fitting&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All model fitting was conducted in Python, exploiting the routines implemented by the ‘Himalaya’ package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="la Tour, T.

Banded ridge regression expands on these techniques by estimating a separate &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; for separate feature spaces &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; of the design matrix &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;—thereby optimizing regularization strengths independently for each feature space (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;). Banded ridge regression therefore respects the fact that different feature spaces in the design matrix may differ in covariance structure, number of features and prediction performance—entailing different optimal regularization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present case, our two feature spaces consisted of the visual and somatosensory modalities or, equivalently, the 400 V1 and S1 model time courses (X&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, X&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) described in the previous section. Thus, to model brain activity of a particular voxel, banded-ridge regression computes the weights &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, as defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${b}^{* }=\mathop{{\rm{argmin}}}\limits_{b}{\Vert \sum _{i}{X}_{i}{b}_{i}-y\Vert }_{2}^{2}+\sum _{i}{\lambda }_{i}{\Vert {b}_{i}\Vert }_{2}^{2}.$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly to unbanded ridge regression, the ridge weights &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are estimated from the training data and the hyperparameters &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are learned through cross validation. In the present case, our training data consisted of four runs of functional data in which the participants watched an independent video. This natural organization of the data enabled us to use a leave-one-video-out cross-validation strategy to estimate &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Connective-field estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a given voxel, the coefficients &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the banded ridge regression model can be interpreted as the cross-validated importance of each model time course in the design matrix in explaining its response throughout the experiment (rest or video watching). By extension, as each model time course derives from an orthogonal spatial profile on the surface of V1 or S1, this means that &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; also implicitly estimates the importance of each of the underlying spatial profiles. Accordingly, for any given voxel, the dot product of its estimated &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and the corresponding spatial profiles &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; reveals a spatial map of the importance of each vertex on S1 and V1 in explaining the voxels response—or equivalently—it estimates its visual and somatosensory ‘connective field’ (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this method of connective-field estimation is more flexible than ‘classic’ connective-field estimation procedure as it removes the constraint that the connective-field profile is a Gaussian defined by a centre (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and extent (&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;), and can estimate non-canonical or irregular spatial patterns that do not resemble unimodal and circularly symmetric Gaussians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this form of connective-field modelling through banded ridge regression is highly extensible as it can incorporate additional source regions with different topographic formats (for example, primary motor cortex, primary auditory cortex) simply through expansion of the feature spaces and bands in the design matrix. Banded ridge regression is particularly suitable in this context of multiple, potentially correlated feature spaces, as the estimation of multiple regularization parameters also leads to implicit feature selection&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="la Tour, T. D., Eickenberg, M., Nunez-Elizalde, A. O. &amp;amp; Gallant, J. L. Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression.

During cross-validation, banded ridge regression is able to learn to ignore some feature spaces to improve generalization performance. To ignore an uninformative feature space, banded ridge regression penalizes its influence by assigning a large regularization hyperparameter &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that the coefficients &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are shrunk toward zero. This process effectively removes uninformative feature spaces from the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We note that great care should be taken when interpreting connective-field modelling outcomes in regions directly abutting the source region. This is because results in these neighbouring regions are likely to be biased by partial-voluming effects: in this case, a connective field centred in the source region spuriously samples from the neighbouring target region itself across the border. This contamination can be due to several factors, among which the fact that single voxels can sample grey matter on both sides of the boundary on the surface (or across both banks of a sulcus), the broad scale of spatial autocorrelations of the underlying responses and the BOLD point-spread of around 2 mm, more than the voxel size in the acquisitions used here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Connectivity-derived retinotopic and somatotopic mapping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With connective-field profiles estimated for each vertex, preferred visual field and body positions were estimated by taking the dot product of each S1 and V1 connective field and the corresponding somatotopic and retinotopic map (see the ‘Model maps of V1 and S1 topography’ section) and then dividing by the sum of the connective fields (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;). As the values of the connective-field profile represent the importance of each location on the source region in explaining a given voxels response, this is akin to a weighted averaging, whereby the retinotopic/somatotopic maps are averaged in a manner weighted by the predictive performance at each location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the ability of our model to simultaneously estimate retinotopic and somatotopic maps, we compared our connective-field-derived maps to independent maps derived from exogenous stimulation. For an exogenously derived retinotopic map, we leveraged the retinotopic prior previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Benson, N.

The participant-wise &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights for each of 12 body parts were nearest-neighbour resampled into the same 59,000 vertex per hemisphere space as the HCP data. We then conducted a second-level GLM on these beta weights and then took the dot-product of the resulting group-average betas and their ordinal position on the S1 homunculus, resulting in a continuous toe–tongue metric of body part sensitivity. Note that, before the dot product operation, we averaged the leg &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weight across left and right leg movements, as only this body part was represented bilaterally in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlating our connectivity-derived topographic maps with these exogenous maps, we confirm that our outcomes recovered detailed somatotopic and retinotopic organization that closely mirrors those derived from exogenous stimulation. Notably, even in medial and insular regions, where the performance of the connective-field model is relatively low, many features of the exogenously derived somatotopic maps are clearly present in our own (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig10"&gt;5e–h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Analysis of subfields within S1&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explicitly relate our connective-field coordinates to body parts, we leveraged the definitions of four topographic body part fields within our S1 source region (3b) provided previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Glasser, M.

This means that, although the corrected values are no longer interpretable as variance explained, they reflect the superiority of the generalization performance of a spatial connective-field model relative to a non-spatial model. This correction therefore conservatively assesses the presence of true topographic connectivity by referencing against an explicit null model.

For visualization and analysis of group-level results (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), we thresholded according to vertex locations that have significant topographic connectivity according to a one sample &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (see above). Any areas in which the group-level topographic connectivity is significantly greater than 0 are shown on the plot (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05). This measure is more conservative than &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as it is a cross-validated performance measure explicitly referenced against a null model. We note that this thresholding procedure yields regions previously defined as being somatotopic and parameter estimates from these regions agree well with conventionally defined estimates derived from exogenous stimulation (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig10"&gt;5e–h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all somatotopic regions analysed in this manuscript survived multiple-comparisons correction using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), which controls for family-wise error while accounting for spatial correlations in the data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Smith, S. &amp;amp; Nichols, T.

Rather than applying an initial cluster-forming threshold, TFCE integrates evidence for cluster-like structure across all possible thresholds by weighting both the height of the statistic and the spatial extent of signal support. Specifically, topographic connectivity scores were first converted into TFCE scores, which were then compared against a null distribution generated by random sign-flips across participants. For each permutation, the TFCE transformation was recomputed and the maximum TFCE value retained, yielding a null distribution of 2,000 maximum scores. The observed TFCE scores were then conservatively evaluated against this null distribution, with corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values derived from the corresponding quantiles (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01, two-tailed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individual-participant outcomes, we used procedures that mirrored those of the HCP 7 T retinotopy pipeline&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Benson, N.

Vis. 18, 23–23 (2018)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#ref-CR66" id="ref-link-section-d86052832e2636"&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For each modality-split variance-explained score (visual, somatosensory), we determined a threshold by fitting a Gaussian mixture model with two Gaussians to the distribution of variance explained values across vertices (excluding source regions) and then identified the value at which the posterior probability switches from the Gaussian with the lower mean to that with the higher mean. The interpretation of this procedure is that the Gaussian with a lower mean is likely to reflect noise (vertices that are not responsive to visual or somatosensory information), the Gaussian with larger mean is likely to reflect signal (vertices that are sensitive to visual or somatosensory information) and values above the threshold are more likely to reflect signal than noise. This procedure resulted in a visual variance explained threshold of 2.4% and a somatosensory variance explained threshold of 1.9%, which are very close to those used for the HCP retinotopy data (2.2%). The application of this procedure to the HCP average participant yielded a threshold of 10% for the somatosensory modality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the consistency in sensitivity to visual and somatosensory information at the individual level, we summed the number of participants for whom both modalities were above threshold at each vertex location (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt;). To statistically evaluate the likelihood of obtaining the observed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; under a null hypothesis (no systematic co-localization of tuning across individuals), we performed a permutation-based cluster analysis. First, we decomposed the cortical surface for each hemisphere into 400 LBOEs and used these spatial profiles as a design matrix for a regression model that predicted the presence of above threshold somatosensory tuning at each cortical location (0 = below threshold, 1 = above threshold). We next used the resulting &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights to predict 1,000 new, surrogate maps of somatosensory tuning by randomizing their sign prior to the dot product with the design matrix. The resulting maps therefore had the same spatial frequency profile as the empirical data but with randomized structure in cortical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each surrogate somatosensory map, we calculated the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; at each vertex location and submitted this to a cluster analysis, whereby clusters were defined as contiguous sets of vertices with at least 96 participants above threshold for both modalities at that location (upper binomial limit for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 174, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05). We then retained the maximum cluster-wise summed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; as a test statistic and concatenated these across surrogate maps to form a null distribution. The same clustering procedure was performed on the empirical data and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were obtained by calculating the proportion of the null distribution that was lower than the summed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; in each empirical cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting data are shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig12"&gt;7a,b&lt;/a&gt;. Four bilateral clusters were detected, the largest of which encompassed dorsolateral visual cortex and parts of the superior parietal lobule. Other, smaller clusters were observed in the superior temporal lobe and frontally, including one overlapping with the frontal eye field. The profile of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; also revealed a small ‘hotspot’ of reliably above-threshold tuning in posterior parietal cortex, which may correspond to the visuotactile map described previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Sereno, M.

For each resampled dataset, we quantified the percentage of voxels within each somatosensory ROI with topographic connectivity scores significantly greater than zero. In this calculation, note that the source region of the analysis (3b) is excluded. Reported CIs were obtained from the quantiles (2.5% and 97.5%) of the resulting distribution of percentage coverage estimates.

Using the correlation between somatotopic connectivity scores and the ‘body v all other categories’ &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistics as a reference, we subtracted the correlation with the corresponding place, face and object &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistics across 10,000 bootstrapped samples.

As such, the statistical significance of agreement between maps is likely to be inflated and violate independence assumptions. Thus, rather than relying on the statistical significance of these empirical agreement statistics alone, they require benchmarking against surrogate data that quantifies the statistical expectations under a null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, we first used the somatotopic map estimated for the cutout region in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; from one split-half of participants to predict the corresponding data from the other split-half.

To generate a null distribution of these statistics, we generated 10,000 ‘surrogate’ homuncular maps from each split-half of participant data. These were generated by taking the estimated &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt; corresponding to each of the LBOEs of the S1 subsurface, randomizing their sign and recomputing the S1 connective field. This manipulation generates randomized connective fields that preserve the same amplitude spectra (distribution of energy across frequency) as the empirical data. For each surrogate dataset, we then computed its performance in predicting the out of set empirical somatotopic map and retained the proportion of these statistics that exceeded the empirical value as a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value. This process was repeated for the second participant split and the resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were summed to obtain a final measure of the probability of obtaining the empirical statistic under the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Visual body-part selectivity estimates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate a map of visual body-part selectivity, we leveraged data from the NSD, also collected at 7 T (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Allen, E.

Specifically, we used the denoised single trial &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-estimates from the final 12 runs of data of all 8 participants. This corresponded to 9,000 functional volumes, each of which included voxel-wise estimates of the response to an image from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Lin, T.-Y. et al.

Openpose detects the location of 17 different keypoints (nose, left eye, right eye, left ear, right ear, left shoulder, right shoulder, left elbow, right elbow, left wrist, right wrist, left hip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle, right ankle). Thus, each image in the COCO dataset is associated with 17 binary variables that codes the presence of each keypoint for every human entity within the image. Critically, the subset of COCO images used in the NSD dataset were spatially cropped relative to the original versions for which the keypoints were computed. We therefore recoded keypoints that were coded as present in the original COCO images but resided outside of the NSD crop-box as being 0 (absent). For each image and body part, we calculated the average of the binary variable for each keypoint across entities to give an estimate of the frequency with which the body part was present within entities within the image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we converted these scores into a regressor that explicitly coded selective responses for each body part. For each body part, we calculated a selectivity score defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${X}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}}={\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}\times ({N}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{A}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this calculation, for example, an image with the presence of an ankle and the absence of all other body parts generates the highest score for the ankle selectivity regressor. Conversely, the score will be implicitly penalized as a function of the number of other (non-ankle) body parts that are visible. These regressors for each body part were stacked into a design matrix. This formed the basis of a forward model of visual body selectivity, of which the parameters were estimated by ridge regression. The model was trained on 10 of the runs of data through &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-fold cross-validation and was tested on the final 2. For each voxel, body part preference was defined as the dot product of the resulting &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights and their ordinal position in the S1 homunculus (ankle to nose) providing a continuous map of visual body part selectivity along a similar toe–tongue axis as the somatotopy data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Searchlight analyses: permutation test&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the cutout region in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; we defined geodesic ‘chunks’ of cortex that were centred at each vertex with a radius of 8 mm. To generate empirical statistics, within each one of these chunks we computed the correlation between the somatotopic map shown in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and the target data (vertical visual field position in retinotopic map or visual body part selectivity map). To generate a null distribution of these statistics, we leveraged the same 10,000 phase-scrambled surrogate homuncular maps (see the ‘Robustness of extrastriate somatotopic maps: permutation test’ section) and, for each one, we calculated the corresponding correlations with the target data in each chunk. This distribution of local chunk-wise correlations obtained across all surrogate somatotopic maps served as our null distribution of local correlations. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the correlations within each empirical chunk were obtained as the probability of obtaining such extreme statistics from this null distribution. Note that, for the analysis of the retinotopy data, we excluded chunks for which the range of the estimated visual field positions was less than 1 DVA and therefore had little retinotopic variation. The resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were then projected into the spatial locations of their corresponding chunk and the data were then averaged across hemispheres to produce the data in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig5"&gt;5e,i&lt;/a&gt;. Note that as the chunks contained partially overlapping data, the data in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; show the lowest &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value obtained at each vertex location. In addition to the results reported in the main text, we performed additional analyses that correlated the eccentricity parameter of the retinotopy data with the somatotopic map. This revealed a region overlapping with IPS0 and IPS1 wherein more foveal locations were tuned to facial features and more eccentric locations tuned to limbs (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig13"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Alternative model: field-based connective-field model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that S1 is not a continuous somatotopic map, but consists of discrete body-part fields, defined on the basis of resting state connectivity, myelin and functional data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="Kuehn, E. et al.

Accordingly, a model that assumes discontinuous connectivity at the boundary of such fields, rather than continuous connectivity along the 3b surface, may provide a viable alternative account of the data. To explicitly test this organizing influence of body part fields, we compared our full connective-field model that uses all of 3b as a source region to 4 alternative connective field models (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig13"&gt;8e&lt;/a&gt;), each with restricted source regions corresponding to the lower limb, trunk, upper limb and face fields, following the definitions described in the ‘Analysis of subfields within the S1’ section. To ensure validity of such a comparison, we determined the number of LBOEs in each of these restricted source regions sufficient to reconstruct 4 mm Gaussian connective fields at near-ceiling performance (determined by the minimum &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being above 0.98 across vertex locations). This implied 70 LBOEs each for the lower limb, trunk and face fields, and 50 for the upper limb field. These alternative models were then fit using identical procedures described for the full model. For each vertex location, we then selected the cross-validated somatosensory &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the best performing restricted model and subtracted it from that of the full model, yielding a Δ&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases have risen in the United States in recent weeks, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 14% of tests for the illness came back positive during the week that ended on Nov. 15, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. Over 2,700 tests were conducted that week, according to the CDC, meaning that about 380 cases of norovirus were diagnosed in that period.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's more than double the percentage of positive tests recorded about three months ago, when test positivity in the U.S. this year was at its lowest. The week that ended on Aug. 9 saw a 6.53% positivity rate of more than 4,240 tests conducted during that period, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test positivity is an imperfect metric because it can vary based on the number of tests conducted. The CDC's data is based on reports from participating laboratories, hospitals and health departments. Test positivity rates can help provide general data about what diseases are circulating and when, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, sometimes known as the stomach bug or stomach flu, is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the leading cause of foodborne illness, the agency says on its website. Norovirus is extremely contagious and causes symptoms including nausea, belly pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Most people experience symptoms for one to three days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people are sickened with norovirus every year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;, and about 2,500 outbreaks of norovirus are reported in the U.S. each year. The illness results in over 100,000 hospitalizations and about 900 deaths per year. Adults 65 and older are the most likely to die from norovirus, the CDC said. Young children and those with compromised immune systems are also at a higher risk for severe illness or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of norovirus are most common between November and April, the CDC says. Last winter, the U.S. saw a major surge of norovirus, with a more than 25% test positivity rate &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-wave-twice-last-year-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recorded in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, earlier this month, a potential outbreak prompted a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/wilson-middle-school-closed-potential-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Michigan middle school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to close for a day for deep cleaning after dozens of students &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/norovirus-cases-on-the-rise-what-to-know-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported feeling ill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Nearly 100 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/norovirus-outbreak-on-cruise-ship-sickens-nearly-100-people/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cruise ship passengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were sickened by norovirus in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing hands frequently, safely handling and preparing food, and regularly cleaning surfaces can help prevent norovirus from spreading, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is also contagious after symptoms end, so people should continue these precautions for at least two days after they begin to feel better, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

Monkeys Si and Ch were between 8 and 11 years old and weighed approximately 12.7 and 10.7 kg, respectively. All of the experimental procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol, 3055) and were in accordance with the policies and procedures of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Behavioural task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each trial began with the monkeys fixating on a dot at the centre of the screen. During a fixation period lasting 500 ms–800 ms, the monkeys were required to keep their gaze within a circle with a radius of 3.25 degrees of visual angle around the fixation dot. After the fixation period, the stimulus and all four response locations were simultaneously displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimuli were morphs consisting of both a colour and shape (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;). The stimuli were rendered as three-dimensional models using POV-Ray and MATLAB (MathWorks) and displayed using Psychtoolbox on a Dell U2413 LCD monitor positioned 58 cm from the animal. Stimuli were morphed along circular continua in both colour and shape (that is, drawn from a four-dimensional ‘Clifford’ torus; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). Colours were drawn from a photometrically isoluminant circle in the CIELAB colour space, connecting the red and green prototype colours. Shapes were created by circularly interpolating the parameters defining the lobes of the ‘bunny’ prototype to the parameters defining the corresponding lobes of the ‘tee’ prototype. The mathematical representation of the morph levels adhered to the equation &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({X}_{1}^{2}+{X}_{2}^{2}+{X}_{3}^{2}={P}^{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; represents the parameter value in a feature dimension (for example, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; values in CIELAB colour space). We chose the radius (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) to ensure sufficient visual discriminability between morph levels. The deviation of each morph level from prototypes (0% and 100%) was quantified using percentage, corresponding to positions on the circular space from −π to 0 and 0 to π. Morph levels were generated at eight levels: 0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%, 70%, 50%, 30%, corresponding to 0, π/6, π/2, 5π/6, π, −5π/6, −π/2 and −π/6, respectively. 50% morph levels for one feature were only generated for prototypes of the other feature (that is, 50% colours were only used with 0% or 100% shape stimuli and vice versa). Stimuli were presented at fixation and had a diameter of 2.5 degrees of visual angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkeys indicated the colour or shape category of the stimulus by saccading to one of the four response locations, positioned 6 degrees of visual angle from the fixation point at 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees, relative to the vertical line. The reaction time was taken as the moment of leaving the fixation window relative to the time of stimulus onset. Trials with a reaction time below 150 ms were terminated, followed by a brief timeout (200 ms). Correct responses were rewarded with juice, while incorrect responses resulted in short timeouts lasting 1 s for monkey Ch and 5 s for monkey Si. After the trial finished, there was an intertrial interval lasting 2–2.5 s before the next trial began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals performed three category-response tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;). The S1 task required the monkeys to categorize the stimulus by its shape. For a stimulus with a shape that was closer to the ‘bunny’ prototype, the animals had to make a saccade to the UL location to get rewarded. For a stimulus with a shape closer to the ‘tee’ prototype, the animals had to make a saccade to the LR location to be rewarded. For ease of notation, we refer to the combination of the UL and LR target locations as axis 1. The C1 task required the monkeys to categorize the stimulus by its colour. When a stimulus’ colour was closer to ‘red’, the animals made an eye movement to the LR location and when it was closer to ‘green’ the animals made an eye movement to the UL location. Finally, in the C2 task, the monkeys again categorized stimuli based on their colour but responded to the UR location for red stimuli and the LL location for green stimuli. Together, the UR and LL targets formed axis 2. This set of three tasks was designed to be related to one another: the C1 and C2 tasks both required categorizing the colour of the stimulus while the C1 and S1 tasks both required responding on axis 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkeys were not explicitly cued as to which task was in effect. However, they did perform the same task for a block of trials allowing the animal to infer the task based on the combination of stimulus, response and reward feedback. Tasks switched when the monkeys’ performance reached or exceeded 70% on the last 102 trials of task S1 and task C1 or the last 51 trials of task C2. For monkey Si, block switches occurred when their performance reached or exceeded the 70% threshold for all morphed and prototype stimuli in the relevant task dimension independently. For monkey Ch, block switches occurred when their average performance at each morph level in the relevant task dimension exceeded the 70% threshold (that is, average of all 30% morphs, average of all 70% morphs, and 0% and 100% prototypes in colour dimension were all equal or greater than 70% accuracy in the C1 and C2 tasks). Moreover, on a subset of recording days, to prevent monkey Ch from perseverating on one task for an extended period of time, the threshold was reduced to 65% over the last 75 trials for S1 and C1 tasks after the monkey had already done 200 or 300 trials on that block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the animal hit the performance threshold, the task switched. This was indicated by a flashing yellow screen, a few drops of reward and a delay of 50 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure even sampling of tasks despite the limited number of trials each day, the axis of response always changed following a block switch. During axis 1 blocks, either S1 task or C1 task was pseudorandomly selected, interleaved with C2 task blocks. Pseudorandom selection within axis 1 blocks avoided three consecutive blocks of the same task, ensuring the animal performed at least one block of each task during each session. On average, animals performed of 560, 558 and 301 trials and 2.68, 2.77 and 5.4 blocks per day for the S1, C1 and C2 tasks, respectively. Task orders and trial conditions were randomized across trials within each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeys Si and Ch underwent training for 36 and 60 months, respectively. Both animals were trained in the same order of tasks: S1, C2 and then C1. Each animal underwent exposure to every task manipulation. As all of the animals were allocated to a single experimental group, blinding was neither necessary nor feasible during behavioural training. Electrophysiological recordings began when the monkeys consistently executed five or more blocks daily. Further details on the behavioural methods and results have been previously reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Bouchacourt, F., Tafazoli, S., Mattar, M.

By contrast, stimuli in the red-bunny and green-tee portion of stimulus space were ‘incongruent’, as they required different responses during the two tasks (UL and LR in S1 task; LR and UL in C1 task, respectively). To ensure the animals performed the task well, 80% of the trials included incongruent stimuli. Note that, as the C2 task was the only one to use axis 2, there were no congruent or incongruent stimuli on those blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Analysis of behavioural data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychometric curves plot the fraction of trials in which the animals classified a stimulus with a specific morph level as being a member of the ‘green’ category for the C1 and C2 tasks or the ‘tee’ category for the S1 task. The fraction of responses for a given morph level of the task-relevant stimulus dimension was averaged across all morph levels of the task-irrelevant dimension during the last 102/102/51 trials of the S1/C1/C2 task (for example, for the C1 task, the fraction of responses for 70% green stimuli were averaged across all shape morph levels). As the stimulus space was circular, we averaged the behavioural response for the two stimuli at each morph level on each side of the circle (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). Psychometric curves were quantified by fitting the mean datapoints with a modified Gauss error function (erf):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$F=\theta +\lambda \times \left(\mathrm{erf}\,(\frac{x-\mu }{\sigma })+1\right)/2,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where erf is the error function, &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; is a vertical bias parameter, &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; is a squeeze factor, &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; is a threshold, and &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt; is a slope parameter. Fitting was done in MATLAB with the maximum likelihood method (fminsearch.m function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate performance during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;), we used a sliding window of 15 trials, stepped 1 trial, to calculate a running average of performance immediately after a switch or right before a switch. Performance was estimated using trials from all blocks of the same task, regardless of the identity of the stimulus. To test whether behavioural performance differed significantly between the C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–C1 sequences during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;; S1–C2–S1 or C1–C2–S1 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig13"&gt;8a&lt;/a&gt; and C1–C2 or S1–C2 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig13"&gt;8b&lt;/a&gt;), we applied &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test using the chi2test.m function as implemented previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Axensten, P. chi2test (MATLAB Central File Exchange, 2007);

Chamber positions were determined using 3D model reconstruction of the skull and brain using structural MRI scans. We recorded neurons from the LPFC (Brodmann area 46 d and 46 v, 480 neurons), aIT (area TEa, 239 neurons), PAR (Brodmann area 7, 64 neurons), the FEF (Brodmann area 8, 149 neurons) and the striatum (STR, caudate nucleus, 149 neurons).

To record from the LPFC and FEF we used epoxy-coated tungsten single electrodes (FHC). Pairs of single electrodes were placed in a custom-built grid with manual micromanipulators that lowered electrode pairs using a screw. This enabled us to record 20–30 neurons simultaneously from cortical areas near the surface. To record from deeper regions (PAR, aIT and STR) we used 16ch or 32ch Plexon V-Probes (Plexon). These probes were lowered using the same custom-built grid through guide tubes. During lowering, we used both structural MRI scans and the characteristics of the electrophysiological signal to track the position of the electrode. A custom-made MATLAB GUI tracked electrode depth during the recording session and marked important landmarks until we found the brain region of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings were acute; up to 50 single electrodes and three V-Probes were inserted into the brain each day (in some recording sessions one additional V-Probe was also inserted in the LPFC). Single electrodes and V-probes were lowered though the intact dura at the beginning of recording session and allowed to settle for 2–3 h before recording, improving the stability of recordings. Neurons were recorded without bias. Electrodes were positioned to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the electrophysiological signal without consideration of neural type or selectivity. Experimenters were blinded to experimental conditions while recording neurons. We did not simultaneously record from all five regions in all recording sessions. We began recording from the LPFC and FEF for the first 5–10 days and then added PAR, STR and aIT on successive days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband neural activity was recorded at 40 kHz using a 128-channel OmniPlex recording system (Plexon). We performed 15 recording sessions with monkey Ch and 19 recording sessions with monkey Si. After all recordings were complete, we used electrical microstimulation in monkey Si, and structural MRI and microstimulation in monkey Ch, to identify the FEF. Electrical stimulation was delivered as a train of anodal-leading biphasic pulses with a width of 400 µs and an interpulse frequency of 330 Hz. A site was identified as the FEF when electrical microstimulation of around 50 µA evoked a stereotyped eye-movement on at least 50% of the stimulation attempts. In monkey Ch, untested electrode locations were classified as FEF if they fell between two FEF sites (as confirmed with electrical stimulation) in a region that was confirmed as being FEF using MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye position was recorded at 1 kHz using an Eyelink 1000 Plus eye-tracking system (SR Research). Sample onset was recorded using a photodiode attached to the screen. Eye position, photodiode signal and behavioural events generated during the task were all recorded alongside neural activity in the OmniPlex system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Signal preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological signals were filtered using a 4-pole high pass 300 Hz Butterworth filter. To reduce common noise, the median of the signals recorded from all single electrodes in each chamber was subtracted from the activity of all single electrodes. For V-Probe recordings, we subtracted the median activity for all channels along the probe from each channel. To detect spike waveforms, a 4&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; threshold was used where &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is an estimate of s.d. of noise distribution of signal &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; defined as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\sigma }_{n}=\mathrm{median}\,\left(\frac{|x|}{0.6745}\right)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timepoints at which the electrophysiological signal (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) crossed this threshold with a negative slope were identified as putative spiking events. Spike waveforms were saved (total length was 44 samples, 1.1 ms, of which 16 samples, 0.4 ms, were pre-threshold). Repeated threshold crossing within 48 samples (1.2 ms) was excluded. All waveforms recorded from a single channel were manually sorted into single units, multiunit activity or noise using Plexon Offline Sorter (Plexon). Units that were partially detected during a recording session were also excluded. Experimenters were blinded to the experimental conditions while sorting waveforms into individual neurons. All analyses reported in this Article were performed on single units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all reported electrophysiology analysis, saccade time was calculated as the moment at which the instantaneous eye speed exceeded a threshold of 720 degrees of visual angle per second. Instantaneous eye speed was calculated as &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\sqrt{{\left(\frac{{\rm{d}}x}{{\rm{d}}t}\right)}^{2}+{\left(\frac{{\rm{d}}y}{{\rm{d}}t}\right)}^{2}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; are the position of the eye on the monitor at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent experiments were performed on two monkeys and the data were combined for subsequent analyses. As described below, statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using two-tailed cluster correction unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise noted, nonparametric tests were performed using 1,000 iterations; therefore, exact &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are specified when &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.001. Unless stated otherwise, all data were smoothed with a 150 ms boxcar. To compare the onset timing differences between within and shared-colour representations across brain regions (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig11"&gt;6d&lt;/a&gt;), classifier accuracy for each region was smoothed using a 50 ms boxcar filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All analyses were performed in MATLAB 2021b (MathWorks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Using cluster mass to correct for multiple comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the significance of observed clusters in the time series data, we used a two-tailed cluster mass correction method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Maris, E. &amp;amp; Oostenveld, R. Nonparametric statistical testing of EEG- and MEG-data. J. Neurosci. Methods 164, 177–190 (2007)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#ref-CR60" id="ref-link-section-d99810997e2379"&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with multiple comparisons and helps identify clusters of contiguous timepoints that exhibit statistically significant deviations from the null distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first generated a null distribution (NullDist) by shuffling the observed data, breaking the relationship between the neural signal and the task parameter of interest (details of how data were shuffled are included with each test below). The observed data were also included as a ‘shuffle’ in the null distribution and the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score of the null distribution for each timepoint was calculated. To define significant moments in time, we computed the upper and lower thresholds based on the null distribution. The thresholds were determined non-parametrically using percentiles. The resulting thresholds, denoted as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;threshold upper&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;threshold lower&lt;/sub&gt;, serve as critical values for identifying significant deviations in both tails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timepoints of significant signal were identified by finding the moments when the value in each shuffle within the null distribution or the observed data exceeded the computed thresholds. These timepoints were then clustered in time, such that contiguous values above the threshold were summed together. The sum was calculated on the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-transformed values of each time series. This resulted in a mass of each contiguous cluster in the data. To correct for multiple comparisons, we took the maximum absolute value of the cluster mass across time for each shuffle. This resulted in a distribution of maximum cluster masses. Finally, the two-tailed &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of each cluster in the observed data was determined by comparing its mass to the distribution of maximum cluster masses in the null distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;FR calculation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all analyses, we estimated the FR of each neuron by averaging the number of action potentials within a 100 ms window, stepping the window every 10 ms. Changing the width of the smoothing window did not qualitatively change our results. The time labels in the figures denote the trailing edge of this moving window (that is, 0 ms would be a window from 0 ms to 100 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;GLM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate how individual neurons represented task variables, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) to relate the activity of each neuron (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) to the task variables at each moment of time. The full model was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$y={\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}\times \mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{colour}\,\mathrm{category}+{\beta }_{2}\times \mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{shape}\,\mathrm{category}+{\beta }_{3}\times \mathrm{time}+{\beta }_{4}\times \mathrm{task}\,\mathrm{identity}+{\beta }_{5}\times \mathrm{motor}\,\mathrm{response}\,\mathrm{direction}+{\beta }_{6}\times \mathrm{reward}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is the FR of each neuron, normalized to the maximum FR across all trials, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are the regression coefficients corresponding to each predictor. Predictors were: stimulus colour category, indicating the colour category of the stimulus (categorical variable); stimulus shape category, indicating the shape category of the stimulus (categorical variable); time, indicating the temporal progression within a recording session, normalized between 0 and 1 (continuous variable); task identity, indicating the identity of the task (categorical variable); motor response direction, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; UL, UR, LL or LR); reward, indicating whether a reward was received following the response (binary variable; 1 for reward, 0 for no reward).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLM coefficients (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation as implemented by MATLAB’s lassoglm.m function. Independent models were fit for each timepoint. To address potential overfitting, we applied Lasso (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) regularization to the GLM weights with regularization coefficients (lambda) values of [0, 0.0003, 0.0006, 0.0009, 0.0015, 0.0025, 0.0041, 0.0067, 0.0111, 0.0183]. In a separate set of runs, we fit the GLM models to 80% of data and tested on the remaining 20%. The lambda value with maximum &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the withheld data was used when estimating the CPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;CPD calculation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the unique contribution of each predictor to a neuron’s activity, we used the CPD. This metric quantifies the percent of explained variance that is lost when a specific factor is removed from the full model. The CPD was computed by initially fitting the GLM with all the factors (full model) as described above. Each factor was then sequentially removed to create a set of reduced models, each of which were fit to the data. The CPD for each predictor &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) was calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{CPD}(X(t))=\frac{{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\mathrm{reduced}}-{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\text{full model}}}{{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\mathrm{reduced}}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where SSE&lt;sub&gt;reduced&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of square error due to predictor &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, SSE&lt;sub&gt;full model&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of square error of the full model with all predictors&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Chiang, F.-K. &amp;amp; Wallis, J. D. Neuronal encoding in prefrontal cortex during hierarchical reinforcement learning. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 30, 1197–1208 (2018)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#ref-CR61" id="ref-link-section-d99810997e2699"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that, because the CPD statistic estimates the additional explained variance captured by each term, it controls for potential covariation between terms. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, as with all neurophysiological studies, it is difficult to distinguish between the encoding of a specific cognitive variable (for example, task) and its effect on the representation of other cognitive variables (for example, the observed suppression of sensory and/or motor representations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a permutation test to assess whether CPDs for each predictor, at each timepoint, and for each neuron, was significantly larger than expected by chance. To compute a null distribution for CPD for each predictor, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting the predictor values relative to the neural activity and refitting the full and reduced models (as above). The likelihood of the observed CPD was then estimated by computing the proportion of permuted datasets that yielded a CPD greater than or equal to that of the observed dataset. To account for multiple comparisons across timepoints, we used cluster correction (detailed above) to estimate corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for each predictor. Neurons that had at least one significant cluster (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were considered to significantly carry information about a task variable. To assess whether an area had a significant number of neurons for a given task variable, we used a binomial test against the alpha-level 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1h–l&lt;/a&gt;, we compensated for a baseline CPD by subtracting the average permuted CPD from the observed CPD. For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1m&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the CPD for each factor across all recorded neurons, subtracted the average baseline in −200–0 ms as the stimulus onset period and then normalized the resulting CPD curve to its maximum value. For Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig8"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the CPD for task identity factor across all recorded neurons then normalized the resulting CPD curve to its maximum value. This highlighted the timing of different factors during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Quantifying population overlap for encoding of task variables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether task variables were encoded by overlapping neural populations (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig8"&gt;3b–k&lt;/a&gt;), we examined neurons for each task variable pair (for example, task identity and reward) to identify those that significantly encoded either or both variables using the GLM model explained above. Using a permutation test, we calculated the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value for neurons encoding both variables. For a neural population of size &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;, with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding the first task variable, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding the second, and&lt;i&gt; N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&amp;amp;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding both, we iterated 10,000 random samples of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;. In each iteration, we counted neurons encoding both variables. The likelihood of the observed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&amp;amp;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; was estimated by calculating the proportion of permutations yielding an equal or greater count of neurons encoding both task variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Classifiers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how task variables were represented in the neural population, we trained a set of binary classifiers to discriminate the vector of FRs across the neural population for two different categories of task variables (depending on the variable of interest). Classifiers were trained with the logistic regression algorithm (as implemented in MATLAB, fitclinear.m function). In brief, the linear classifier relates &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; (vector of neural responses) to &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; (task labels, either +1 or −1) through a linear equation, with weights (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and intercept (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$f(x)={w}^{T}{\bf{x}}+b$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; are optimized to minimize the logistic loss function: &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\mathcal{L}}[y,f(x)]=\frac{-1}{N}{\sum }_{i=1}^{N}[{y}_{i}\log (f({x}_{i}))+(1-{y}_{i})\log (1-f({x}_{i}))]\,\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; is the number of samples. Ridge (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) regularization with a regularization coefficient &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; = 1/60 was used to minimize over-fitting. The classifier was trained with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Construction of pseudopopulations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All classifiers were trained on pseudopopulation of responses constructed from neurons across all recording sessions. A separate pseudopopulation was constructed for each classifier analysis based on the trial types of interest (described below). To be included in the pseudopopulation, each neuron had to be recorded for a minimum number of trials (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;train&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;test&lt;/sub&gt;) of each type of trial. The FR of neurons were concatenated to form a vector of neuron FRs (the pseudopopulation). Neural activity was aligned in time relative to either the sample onset or saccade onset, depending on the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combine neurons across recording sessions into a single ‘trial’ of the pseudopopulation, we drew trials for each neuron with matching experimental conditions (that is, matched in terms of reward, colour and shape morph level, task identity and response direction). For example, when constructing a pseudopopulation for classifying the colour category, the first trial was constructed by concatenating the neural responses of neurons on trials that were rewarded, had a colour morph level of 100 and a shape morph level of 30. If a neuron did not have a trial with an exactly matching stimulus, then a trial that matched the colour category and reward would be randomly chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Cross-validation of classifiers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate logistic regression classifier was trained and tested on withheld trials for each timepoint. To estimate variability, the entire analysis was repeated 250 times, with each iteration involving a different partition of trials into training and testing sets. This new set of trials was randomly sampled with replacement (always ensuring test trials were separate from the train trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When testing the performance of a classifier trained on the same set of conditions (for example, training and testing colour categorization on the C2 task), the performance of the classifier was taken as the average performance across tenfold cross-validation. However, as detailed in the main text, many of the classifiers were trained and tested across conditions (for example, across different tasks or across trials during learning of the task). In this case, the test trials were randomly resampled ten times for each training set, and the classifier’s performance was averaged across folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Balancing classifier conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid bias in the classifier, we balanced trial conditions to ensure the observed results were not due to other experimental factors. Conditions were balanced in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced congruency: classifiers were trained on an equal number of congruent and incongruent trials, resulting in equal number of trials for four stimulus types: green-bunny, green-tee, red-bunny and red-tee.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced reward: classifiers were trained on an equal number of rewarded and unrewarded trials, balancing the stimulus identity of the relevant dimension on each side of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(3)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced response direction: classifiers were trained on an equal number of trials from each response direction on the task’s response axis (for example, trials with response on axis 1 for the C1 task). This necessarily included error trials but balanced the number of each response direction on each side of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Classifying the colour category and shape category of stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colour and shape classifiers were trained to decode the stimulus colour category or shape category from the vector of activity across the pseudopopulation of neurons (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2a,b&lt;/a&gt;). A balanced number of congruent and incongruent stimuli were included in the training data to ensure colour and shape information could be decoded independently. Classifiers were trained for each task independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most classifiers were trained on correct trials alone. This maximized the number of trials included in the analysis and ensured the animals were engaged in the task. As many of our analyses were tested across tasks, this mitigates concerns that motor response information might confound stimulus category information. However, to ensure response direction did not affect our analyses, we controlled for motor response by balancing response direction in a separate set of analysis (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig9"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5c,d&lt;/a&gt;). Although this significantly reduced the number of trials, and required us to include error trials, qualitatively similar results were often observed. The total number of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for colour category classification was 403, 110, 195, 54 and 116, respectively. The total numbers of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for shape category classification were 480, 149, 239, 64 and 149, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Classifying response direction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate set of response classifiers were trained to decode the motor response from the vector of activity across the pseudopopulation of neurons. Response direction was decoded within each axis (for example, UL versus LR for axis 1). When training and testing on the same task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;), we included only trials that the animal responded on the correct axis (for example, axis 1 for the S1 and C1 tasks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For testing whether response direction could be decoded across axes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;), we trained the classifier using trials from task C1, where the animal responded on axis 1, and then tested this classifier using trials from task C2, where the animal responded on axis 2, and vice versa. To control for stimulus-related information, we balanced rewarded and unrewarded trials for each condition and only included incongruent trials. This ensured that trials from the same stimulus category were present in both response locations. Similar results were seen when balancing for congruency and reward simultaneously, although the low number of incorrect trials for congruent trials resulted in a small set of neurons with the minimum number of train and test trials. The total number of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for response direction classification was 403, 110, 195, 54 and 116, respectively. Owing to limited number of trials, the total number of LPFC neurons for Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig9"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt; was 95 (only from animal Si).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Using permutation tests to estimate the likelihood of classifier accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used permutation tests to estimate the likelihood the observed classifier accuracy occurred by chance. To create a null distribution of classifier performance, we randomly permuted the labels of training data 1,000 times. Importantly, only the task-variable of interest was permuted—permutations were performed within the set of trials with the same identity of other (balanced) task variables. For example, if trials were balanced for reward, we shuffled labels within correct trials and within incorrect trials, separately. This ensured that the shuffling broke only the relationship between the task-variable of interest and the activity of neurons. Shuffling of the labels was performed independently for each neuron before building the pseudopopulation and training classifiers. Neurons that were recorded in the same session had identical shuffled labels. To stabilize the estimate of the classifier performance, the performance of the classifier on the observed and each instance of the permuted data were averaged over 10-folds and 20 to 50 novel iterations of each classifier. The null distribution was the combination of the permuted and observed values (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,001). The likelihood of the observed classifier performance was then estimated as its percentile within the null distribution. As described above, we used cluster correction to control for multiple comparisons across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Testing classification across tasks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify whether the representation of colour, shape, or response direction generalized across tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2e,f,h,i&lt;/a&gt;), we trained classifiers on trials from one task and then tested the classifier on trials from another task. For example, to test cross-generalization of colour information across the C1 and C2 tasks, a colour classifier was trained on trials from the C2 task was tested on trials from the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2f&lt;/a&gt;). To remove any bias due to differences in baseline FR across tasks, we subtracted the mean FR during each task from all trials of that task (at each timepoint). Similar results were observed when we did not subtract the mean FR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Cross-temporal classification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure how classifiers generalized across time, we trained classifiers to discriminate colour category (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5b&lt;/a&gt;) or response direction (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2h&lt;/a&gt;) using 100 ms time bins of FR data, sliding by 10 ms. Classifiers trained on each time bin were then tested on all time bins of the test trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Projection onto the encoding axis of classifier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To visualize the high-dimensional representation of task variables, we used the MATLAB predict.m function to project the FR response on test trials onto the one-dimensional encoding space defined by the vector orthogonal to the classification hyperplane. In other words, the projection measures the distance of the neural response vector to the classifier hyperplane. For example, to measure the encoding of each colour category in the C1 task, we projected the trial-by-trial FR onto the axis orthogonal to the hyperplane of the colour classifier trained during the C1 task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Quantifying the impact of task sequence on task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task-discovery period was defined as the first 110–120 trials after a switch in the task. The monkey’s performance increased during this period, as they learned which task was in effect (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;). As described in the main text, the animal’s behavioural performance depended on the sequence of tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;) and we therefore analysed neural representations separately for two different sequences of tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–S1 block sequence (same task transition): the task on axis 1 (C1 or S1) repeated across blocks. As shown in the main text, monkeys tended to perform better during these task sequences, as if they were remembering the previous axis 1 task.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–S1 block sequence (different task transition): the task on axis 1 changed across blocks. As shown in the main text (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;), monkeys tended to perform worse on these task sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we were interested in understanding how changes in neural representations corresponded to the animals’ behavioural performance, we divided the ‘different task transition’ sequences into two further categories: in ‘Low Initial Performance’ blocks, the animal’s behavioural performance during the first 25 trials of the block was less than 50%, while on the ‘high initial performance’ blocks, the performance was greater than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to constrains on number of neurons, different but overlapping population of neurons were used to quantify neural representations in C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–C1 tasks sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Task belief representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the animal’s internal representation of the task (that is, their ‘belief’ about the task, as represented by the neural population), we trained a task classifier to decode whether the current task was C1 or S1. The classifier was trained on neural data from the last 75 trials of each task block, when the animal’s performance was high (reflecting the fact that the animals were accurately estimating the task at the end of the block). The number of congruent and incongruent trials were balanced in the training dataset (32 trials: 4 trials for each of the four stimulus types, in each task). We included all C1 blocks regardless of their task sequence in training set. Only correct trials were used to train and test the classifier. To minimize the effect of neural response to visual stimulus, the classifier was trained on neural activity from the fixation period (that is, before stimulus onset). As we were interested in measuring differences between tasks, we did not subtract the mean firing rate before training the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task classifier was tested on trials from the beginning of blocks of the C1 task. Test trials were drawn from windows of 40 trials, slid every 5 trials, during learning (starting from trial 1–40 to trial 71–110). Overlapping test and train trials from the same task were removed. In contrast to training set, testing was done separately for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt;). As we were interested in focusing on the learning of the C1 task, we only used S1–C2–C1 task sequences with low initial performance (see above). Classifiers were tested on pseudopopulations built from trials within each trial window, with a minimum of four test trials (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types from task C1). Neurons that did not include the required number of test trials for all trial windows were dropped. Note that, as we were using a small moving window of trials during task discovery, we had to trade-off the number of included neurons and the number of train/test trials for this analysis. Moreover, although the number of correct trials increased as the animal discovered the task in effect, we kept a constant number of train and test trials in each of the sliding trial windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the animal’s belief above the current task, we measured the distance to the hyperplane of the C1/S1 task classifier (task belief encoding). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in pre-stimulus processing window (−400ms to 0 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Correlation between task belief encoding and behavioural performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the correlation between the animal’s task belief during task discovery and their behavioural performance (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;), we used Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; statistic with a permutation test to correct for autocorrelation in the signal (detailed below). This measurement was performed using data from each window of trials and the belief encoding, as estimated from the task classifier, on that same window of trials. As we are working with pseudopopulations of neurons, we estimated the behavioural performance for each window of trials during learning as the average of behavioural performance across all the trials in the window. The behavioural performance for each trial was taken as the average of the animal’s behavioural performance during the previous 10 trials. This yielded one average performance for each of the 16 trial windows. The task belief was measured for the same trials, using the average distance to the task classifier hyperplane, averaged over the time period from 400 ms to 0 ms before the onset of the stimulus (note that, as described above, all of these trials are withheld from the training data). Task belief was then taken as the average distance across all trials in a window of trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Evolution of colour category representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were interested in quantifying how the shared colour representation was engaged as the animal discovered the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4f,g&lt;/a&gt;). To this end, we trained a classifier to categorize colour using the last 75 trials of the C2 task, when the animal’s behavioural performance was high, and then tested it during discovery of the C1 task. The classifier was trained on only correct trials and the training data were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (16 trials: 4 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). This ensured an equal number of correct trials for each congruency type across all trial windows, controlling for motor response activity during the task discovery period. As cross-axis response decoding between the C1 and C2 tasks was weak (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;), cross-task classifiers are capturing the representation of the colour category that is shared between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the task classifier described above, the shared colour classifier was tested using trials from the C1 task in a sliding window of 40 trials stepped 5 trials, in both the S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4f&lt;/a&gt;; as above, only low initial performance blocks were used for the S1–C2–C1 task sequences). We used four trials to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types from task C1). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4g&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in stimulus processing window (100 ms to 300 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Evolution of shape category representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were interested in measuring the change in the representation of the stimulus’ shape category as the animal learned the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;). Our approach followed that of the colour category representation described above, and so we only note differences here. We trained a classifier to categorize stimulus shape based on neural responses during the S1 task (limited to the last 75 trials of each block). To ensure the classifier was only responding to shape (and not motor response), we trained the classifier on a balanced set of correct (rewarded) and incorrect (unrewarded) trials (16 trials: 4 trials for each reward condition and for each shape category). The classifier was tested using trials from the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;). Note that we used the same C1 trials to quantify the representation of shared colour category, shape category and task belief for S1–C2–C1 task sequences. For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4j&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in the window of time when stimuli were processed (100 ms to 300 ms after stimulus onset). The total numbers of LPFC neurons included for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences to quantify the representation of shared colour category, shape category and task belief were 136 and 154, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Evolution of response direction representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the change in response direction representation as the monkey’s learned the C1 task, we trained a classifier to categorize the response direction based on the neural response during the S1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4k&lt;/a&gt;; last 75 trials of the block). As above, we used a balanced number of correct and incorrect trials to control for information about the stimulus (12 trials: 3 trials for each reward condition and each response location). The classifier was then tested on correct trials from the C1 task during task learning (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4k&lt;/a&gt;; as above: sliding windows of 40 trials, stepped 5 trials, in S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1; tested on 4 trials: 1 for each reward condition and each response location). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4l&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in the window of time when response location was processed (200 ms to 400 ms after stimulus onset). The total numbers of LPFC neurons included for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences to quantify the representation of shared response direction were 120 and 155, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Classifier statistical test to detect trends during task discovery period&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the statistical significance of trends in representations during task discovery (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we used trend-free prewhitening (TFPW)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Yue, S., Pilon, P., Phinney, B. &amp;amp; Cavadias, G.

This method helps to reduce serial correlation in time-series data to obtain robust statistical inference in the presence of trends. TFPW first detrends the time series by removing Sen’s slope. It then prewhitens the time series by modelling autocorrelation with an autoregressive (AR) model (typically AR(1)) to produce residuals free of temporal dependencies. Finally, it adds back the original trend to generate processed time series. Both the Mann–Kendall statistics and Sen’s slope were used to estimate the significance of trends in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that our reported statistics are fully unbiased, we used the estimated Sen’s slope on prewhitened data using TFPW to estimate the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of the observed data. To do so, we used permutation tests to estimate the likelihood the observed trend slope occurred by chance. To create a null distribution of classifier performance, we randomly permuted the labels of test data 250 times across all trial windows (trials 1–110 for Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and 1–120 for Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). To stabilize the estimate of the classifier performance, we tested classifiers using the same set trained classifiers (for example, use same set of classifiers trained to decode colour category in C2 task to test colour category decoding in C1 task during task discovery). Furthermore, the performance of the classifier on the observed and each instance of the permuted data were averaged over 10-folds and 50 novel iterations of each classifier. The slope was calculated for each timepoint across all time trial windows to estimate the trend for observed and permuted classifier performances. The null distribution was the combination of the permuted and observed slope values (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 251). The likelihood of the observed slope was then estimated as its percentile within the null distribution. As described above, we used cluster correction to control for multiple comparisons across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure rank correlation between two random variables (for example, correlation between task belief and behavioural performance, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;), we used Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;. As TFPW requires a monotonic time variable and cannot be applied here, we computed Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; for both observed and permuted datasets. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score values of observed data against permuted values were reported to account for autocorrelation inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Transfer of information between subspaces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described in the main text, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that the representation of the stimulus colour in the shared colour subspace predicted the response in the shared response subspace on a trial-by-trial basis (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3c–e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig12"&gt;7a–c&lt;/a&gt;). To this end, we correlated trial-by-trial variability in the strength of encoding of colour and response along four different classifiers (using Pearson’s correlation as implemented in MATLAB’s corr.m function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, as described above, a shared colour classifier was trained to decode colour category from the C2 task and tested on trials from the C1 task. Training data were balanced for correct and incorrect trials (rewarded and unrewarded trials, 16 trials: 4 trials for each reward condition and each colour category). Test trials were all correct trials (2 trials: 1 trial for each colour category). Both train and test trials were drawn from the last 50 trials from the block (to ensure the animals were performing the task well). The total number of LPFC neurons included for this classifier was 63 (only from monkey Si, owing to constraints on the number of trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a second shared response classifier was trained on trials from the S1 task and then tested on the same set of test trials as the shared colour classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third classifier was trained to decode the response direction on axis 2, using a balance of correct and incorrect trials from the C2 task. This classifier was tested on the same set of test trials as the shared colour classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a fourth classifier was trained to decode the shared colour representation but was now trained on correct trials from the C1 task (12 trials: 3 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types) and tested on correct trials from C2 task (2 trials: 1 trial for each colour category). The total number of LPFC neurons included for this classifier was 101 (only from animal Si, owing to constraints on the number of trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To account for the arbitrary nature of positive and negative labels, we calculated the magnitude of encoding by flipping the encoding for negative labels. All four classifiers were trained on 2,000 iterations of training set trials. Note, that the first three classifiers were tested on the same test trials, allowing for trial-by-trial correlations to be measured. Furthermore, all four classifiers were trained over time, enabling us to measure the cross-temporal correlation between any pairs of classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these four classifiers allowed us to test three hypothesized correlations that reflect the transfer of task-relevant stimulus information into representations of behavioural responses. First, one might expect that, on any given trial before the start of saccade, the strength and direction of the shared colour representation, as estimated by the distance to the hyperplane of the first classifier, should be correlated with the shared response, as estimated by the distance to the hyperplane of the second classifier. This correlation is seen in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3c&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, during the performance of the C1 task, one would expect that before the start of saccade the shared colour representation should not be correlated with the response on the Axes 2 predicted by the C2 task. This is quantified by correlating the distance to the hyperplane of the first classifier and the distance to the hyperplane of the third classifier, as seen in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one would expect these representations to be correlated when the animal is performing the C2 task. This is quantified by correlating the distance to the hyperplane of the fourth classifier and the distance to the hyperplane of the third classifier, as seen in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig12"&gt;7a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Distance along colour and shape encoding axes during the discovery of the task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how the geometry of the neural representation of the colour and shape of the stimulus evolved during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we measured the distance in neural space between the two prototype colours (red and green) and the two prototype shapes (tee and bunny). Distance was measured along the encoding axis for each stimulus dimension (that is, the axis that is orthogonal to the colour and shape classifiers, described above). So, for each test trial, the distance along the colour encoding axis was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{colour}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance}\\ \,=\,\mathrm{Avg}\,\left(\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{abs}(\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{red}\,\mathrm{bunny})-\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{green}\,\mathrm{bunny})),\\ \mathrm{abs}(\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{red}\,\mathrm{tee})-\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{green}\,\mathrm{tee}))\end{array}\right)\,;\end{array}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach enabled us to calculate the distance along red/green colours while controlling for differences across shapes. The colour encoding distance was estimated for 250 iterations of the classifiers, enabling us to estimate the mean and standard error of the distance. A similar process was followed for estimating the shape encoding distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the colour and shape encoding distance during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5a,b&lt;/a&gt;), we calculated the distance above in the sliding window of 45 trials, stepped 5 trials, after the switch into the C1 task during the S1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks with low initial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;CPI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI was defined as the log of the ratio of average colour encoding distance and average shape encoding distance described above:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{CPI}=\log \,\left(\frac{\mathrm{avg}(\mathrm{Colour}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance})}{\mathrm{avg}(\mathrm{Shape}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance})}\right)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the CPI for each task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;), we computed the shape and colour encoding distance using all trials of a given task. To measure the shape distance for all three tasks, we trained a classifier to categorize stimulus shape based on neural responses during the S1 task (limited to the last 75 trials of each block). To ensure that the classifier was responding only to shape (and not motor response), we trained the classifier on a balanced set of correct (rewarded) and incorrect (unrewarded) trials (20 trials: 5 trials for each reward condition and for each shape category). Shape encoding for each task was calculated using four trials to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure colour distance in the S1–C2–C1 task, we trained colour category classifier on correct trials of the C1–C1–C2 task, balancing for congruent and incongruent stimuli (20 trials: 5 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). Colour encoding for each task was calculated using four trials of that task to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track changes in the relative strength of colour and shape information during task discovery, we calculated CPI in a sliding window of 45 trials (slid every 5 trials starting from trial 1–45 to trial 76–120) after the monkey’s switched into the C1 task (during the S1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks, with low initial performance). Note, as we controlled for motor response when calculating shape and colour distance, the CPI is not affected by motor response information&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Flesch, T. et al.

CPI values in 100 ms–300 ms after stimulus onset and belief encoding values in 400 ms to 0 ms before stimulus onset were averaged for all trials in each trial window and the Mann–Kendall correlation between the resulting two vectors was calculated (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Quantifying suppression of axis representation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a response axis classifier to decode whether the current task axis was axis 1 or axis 2. The classifier was trained on neural data from all trials of C1 and C2 tasks with an equal number of trials from each response direction on task specific axis (for example, equal trials for UL and LR response on axis 1 for C1 task, 36 trials: 9 trials for each response direction, in each task). All correct and incorrect trials were used to train and test the classifier. To capture the response period, the classifiers were trained on the number of spikes between 200 ms and 450 ms after stimulus onset. As we were interested in measuring the difference in neural activity between axis of responses, we did not subtract the mean FR before training the classifier. For Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10d,f–i&lt;/a&gt;, the classifier was trained to decode response axis using S1 and C2 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a null distribution for classifier weights, we randomly permuted the response axis labels for a given response direction (1,000 iterations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;Selectivity for axis of response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the classifier &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights to group neurons according to their axis selectivity. Neurons with significantly negative &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as selectively responding to axis 1. Neurons with significantly positive &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as selectively responding to axis 2. Neurons without significant &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as non-selective (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10a&lt;/a&gt;). To determine the significance of a neuron’s classifier weight, we compared the observed &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weight to a null distribution (two-tailed permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the suppression of neural activity for each category of neurons, we averaged FRs of neurons in each category during trials of the C1 task when the animal responded on axis 1 or axis 2 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10e&lt;/a&gt; shows the same analysis for the S1 task). This meant including all trials when the animal responded on axis 1 (both correct and error) and all trials when the animal responded on axis 2 (all errors). As the monkeys rarely responded on incorrect axis (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig7"&gt;2g&lt;/a&gt;), the number of trials was limited and so neurons without any error trials on axis 2 were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that, although neurons were sorted by their activity during the animal’s response (200–450 ms after stimulus onset), we observed suppression across the entire trial (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, similar results were seen when a neuron’s axis selectivity was quantified on withheld trials (for example, in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10d–i&lt;/a&gt;, axis selectivity was defined on S1 and C2 tasks and applied to C1 trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Decoding response axis during the discovery of the task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a response axis classifier to decode whether the current task axis was axis 1 or axis 2. The classifier was trained on neural data from the last 75 trials of the C1 and C2 tasks, when the monkey’s performance was high (reflecting the fact that the animals were accurately responding to the correct axis at the end of the block). The classifier was trained on an equal number of trials from each direction on the response axis (for example, equal trials for UL and LR response on axis 1 for C1 task; 36 trials: 9 trials for each response direction, in each task). Correct and incorrect trials were used to train and test the classifier. To remove the effect of stimulus processing, the classifier was trained on neural activity from the fixation period (that is, −400 to 0 ms before stimulus onset). As we were interested in measuring differences between axis of responses, we did not subtract the mean FR before training the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task classifier was tested on trials from the beginning of blocks of the C1 task. Test trials were drawn from windows of 10 trials, slid every 3 trials, during task discovery (starting from trial 1–10 to trial 66–75). Overlapping test and train trials from the same task were removed. Classifiers were tested on pseudopopulations built from trials within each trial window (two trials: one trial for each response direction on axis one from task C1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Quantifying the angle between classifier hyperplanes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the similarity between the decision boundaries of classifiers trained on different tasks, we calculated the angle between the hyperplanes defined by their weight vectors. Each classifier produced a weight vector &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the hyperplane that separates the data points according to the respective task. We averaged the resulting hyperplane across resampling repetitions of trials (250 iterations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angle &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\theta \)&lt;/span&gt; between two average hyperplanes, defined by weight vectors &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, was calculated using the cosine similarity, which is given by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ8" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\cos (\theta )=\frac{{{\bf{w}}}_{i}\cdot {{\bf{w}}}_{j}}{\Vert {{\bf{w}}}_{i}\Vert \Vert {{\bf{w}}}_{j}\Vert }$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angle &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; was then obtained by taking the inverse cosine of the cosine similarity. Angles close to 0° indicate that the classifiers’ hyperplanes are nearly parallel, implying similar decision boundaries across the tasks. Conversely, angles close to 90° suggest orthogonal hyperplanes, indicating distinct decision boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the angle within the C1 task, we calculated the angle between classifiers trained to classify colour category on the last 50 trials of C1 task in both the C1–C2–C1 task sequence and the S1–C2–C1 task sequence. This ensured that there were no overlapping trials between training samples. Only correct trials were used in this analysis and training and test trials were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (20 trials: 5 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the angle between the colour category classifier in the C1 task and the C2 task, we trained the classifier on last 50 trials of task C1 and task C2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;TDR analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TDR analysis requires multiple steps&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Mante, V., Sussillo, D., Shenoy, K.

The mean and s.d. were computed across all trials and timepoints for each neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; are the regression coefficients corresponding to each predictor. Predictors were: stimulus colour morph level, coded as −1 for 0% morph level, −0.5 for 30% and 170% morph levels, +0.5 for 70% and 130% morph levels, and +1 for 100% morph level; stimulus shape morph level, coded as −1 for 0% morph level, −0.5 for 30% and 170% morph levels, +0.5 for 70% and 130% morph levels and +1 for 100% morph level; time, indicating the temporal progression within a recording session, normalized between 0 and 1 (continuous variable); task identity, indicating the identity of the task (categorical variable: S1, C1, C2); motor response direction on axis 1, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; −1 for UL, +1 for LR); motor response direction on axis 2, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; −1 for LL, +1 for UR); reward, indicating whether a reward was received following the response (binary variable; 1 for reward, 0 for no reward).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLM coefficients (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation as implemented by MATLAB’s lassoglm.m function. Independent models were fit for each timepoint. To address potential overfitting, we applied Lasso (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) regularization to the GLM weights with regularization coefficients (lambda) values of 0.0015. Correct and incorrect trials were used in fitting the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Population average responses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated the average response of the neural population to each task variable. To calculate the average neural response to each colour and shape morph level, we separately averaged trials for within each morph level (0, 30, 70, 100, 130, 170) for each task. To calculate the average neural response for each response direction, we separately averaged trials for within each response direction (UL, UR, LL or LR) for each task. For all task variables, we smoothed the resulting response in time with a 150 ms Boxcar. Finally, we &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-scored the smoothed average for a given unit by subtracting the mean across times and conditions, and by dividing the result by the corresponding s.d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;PCA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used principal component analysis (PCA) (as implemented in MATLAB, pca.m function) to find the dimensions in the state space that captured most of the variance of the population average response and to mitigate the effect of noise. We concatenated the average response across conditions to build matrix &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; of size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;condition &lt;/sub&gt;× &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) × &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;condition&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of conditions and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; is the number of time samples. We used the first &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PCA&lt;/sub&gt; that captured 90% of the explained variance to define a de-noising matrix &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; of size &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt; × &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Regression subspace&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the regression coefficients described above to identify dimensions in the state space containing task related variance. We used four task variables to define this space: colour morph level, shape morph level, response direction on axis 1 and response direction on axis 2. For each of these task variables, we built coefficient vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{v,t}(i)\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponding to regression coefficient for task variable &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;, time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; and unit &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. We then denoised each variable vector by projecting it to the subspace spanned by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PCA&lt;/sub&gt; principal components from the population average defined above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ10" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{v,t}^{{\rm{PCA}}}=D{\beta }_{v,t}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We computed &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{v}^{\max }\)&lt;/span&gt; for each task variable where norm of &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{v,t}^{\mathrm{PCA}}\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix had its maximum value. This defined the time-independent, denoised regression vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ11" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{v}^{\max }={\beta }_{v,{t}_{v}^{\max }}^{\mathrm{PCA}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{v}^{\max }={\mathrm{argmax}}_{t}\parallel {\beta }_{v,t}^{\mathrm{PCA}}\parallel \)&lt;/span&gt;. To compute orthogonal axes of colour, shape and response direction on axis 1 and response direction on axis 2, we orthogonalized the regression vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\max }\)&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;i&gt;QR&lt;/i&gt; decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the first four columns of &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; are orthogonalized regression vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\perp }\)&lt;/span&gt; of four task variables that comprise the regression subspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To then estimate the representation of task-related variables in the neural population, we projected the average population response (described above) for each colour morph level, shape morph level, and response direction onto these orthogonal axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ13" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${p}_{v,c}={{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\perp }}^{T}{X}_{c}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the time series with length &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; for each morph level in a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that because TDR orthogonalizes task features, it can control for motor response when estimating the neural response to colour and shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;CPI using TDR&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the distance between the two prototype colours (red and green) and the two prototype shapes (tee and bunny).

For ‘from switch’ conditions, the first 50 trials after switch to each task were used and, for ‘to switch’ conditions, the last 50 trials in the blocks were used. Similar to TDR method described above, we used QR decomposition to find the orthogonal axes encoding each task variable, but now specific to each task (colour morph level, shape morph level, task identity, reward and task specific axis of response):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ20" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${B}^{\max ,{\rm{C}}1\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{C}}1}{R}_{{\rm{C}}1},{B}^{\max ,{\rm{C}}2\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{C}}2}{R}_{{\rm{C}}2},{B}^{\max ,{\rm{S}}1\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{S}}1}{R}_{{\rm{S}}1}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each resampling, the angle between orthogonal axis of colour of pairs of tasks (C1–C2, C1–S1 and C2–S1) was measured as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ21" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\cos (\theta )=\frac{{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,i}^{\perp }\cdot {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,j}^{\perp }}{\parallel {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,i}^{\perp }\parallel \parallel {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,j}^{\perp }\parallel }$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; are task identity of the tasks. Within-task angles (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig14"&gt;9c,d&lt;/a&gt;) were computed by randomly taking 200 pairs of resampling regression coefficient repetitions, and finding the orthogonal axes explained above. All angles were wrapped to 90 deg. This was because the process of orthogonalization with QR decomposition might result in vectors that are mathematically equivalent but with a flipped sign compared to the input vectors owing to numerical choices or conventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a permutation test to assess whether the angle between pairs of tasks was significantly larger than expected by chance. The observed angle was estimated by fitting the regression model explained above to all trials. To compute a null distribution for angles, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting the predictor values relative to the neural activity and refitting the model. For each permuted dataset, we computed the angle between task pairs as described above. The likelihood of the observed angle was then estimated by computing the proportion of permuted datasets that yielded an angle smaller than or equal to that of the observed angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec53"&gt;Quantifying whether task representations transfer across blocks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the task representation was maintained across blocks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;), we trained a classifier to discriminate between C1 and S1 trials using the last 50 trials of the block. We then tested this classifier in three ways. First, to quantify the information about the identity of C1 versus S1 task, we tested this classifier on withheld trials from last 50 trials of C1 and S1 tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt; (1)). Second, to quantify how much the representation of C1 and S1 tasks transferred to the C2 task, we tested whether the classifier could discriminate between C1 and S1 tasks during the first 50 trials of the C2 task (that is, comparing C1–C2 versus S1–C2). Third, to quantify how much the representation of C1 and S1 tasks was transferred to C1 or S1 in the next block, we tested the classifier on the first 50 trials after the switch in C1 and S1 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all training and testing, the total number of spikes in the period −400 to 0 ms from stimulus onset for each trial were used to build a pseudopopulation. Only correct trials were included in this analysis, and the training and test trials were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (36 trials: 9 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). To compute a null distribution, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting all task identity values relative to the neural activity and refitting the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec54"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#MOESM1"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 16:14:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBmX3k1SlM0Tk56a1JoMGxxbGNkVE52S0U2WEtZXzZseFlIUXBSWW4yczZYTUtRRVdIRGM0OHFNRUZSWndzYjdvYXAzNFBYWTZzNXFDVzFyMjU5TnZ5eWEw</guid></item><item><title>柠檬水的7个好处，由专家解释- Vogue</title><link>https://www.vogue.com/article/lemon-water-daily-benefits</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking water with a slice of lemon first thing in the morning is one of the most vouched-for wellness tips—and not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; for its purifying properties. The benefits of lemon water go beyond just detoxing. “It amplifies the benefits of water, adding both mental and physical virtues,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kylie Bensley&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sulinu&lt;/a&gt;. “While drinking water can help us hit our hydration goals, infusing water with lemon is a very simple, quick task that boosts the function of water itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of lemon water are many and worth diving into. Below, Bensley and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Parada&lt;/a&gt;, director of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Slow Life House&lt;/a&gt;, break down everything we need to know about lemon water and how to drink it the right way (because yes, there is a wrong way to do it). Read on to see what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water supports our overall health and helps keep us hydrated. Adding this citrus fruit to it is a nice bonus for even more health benefits. A glass of lemon water has six main ones, according to Bensley and Parada. These benefits include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Supports the Gut Microbiome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps kick-start the digestion process in the morning,” says Parada, adding that it also helps fight indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. Additionally, lemon is known to stimulate bile and gastric-juice production, which can help prevent gas formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Lemon water] improves gut transit and hydrates the colon,” says Parada, which is why it can help with constipation, especially on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. In addition, lemon, rich in fiber, supports &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gut-digestive-health-best-expert-tips-nutritious-life-diet-sleep-stress-exercise-cleanse"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Strengthens the Immune System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It strengthens the immune system,” says Parada, referring to the high vitamin C content of lemon juice. Additionally, it is also rich in vitamin B, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and enzymes. Studies show that lemon contains minerals that help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003767/" target="_blank"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, supporting our overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Provides Antiaging Skin Benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is good for the skin because of its &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/anti-aging-antioxidant-skin-care-night-vitamin-c-resveratrol"&gt;high content of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that “prevent damage from free radicals,” says Parada. Bensley agrees and says that lemon peels have been found to have antiaging benefits, reduce &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;oxidative stress in skin cells&lt;/a&gt;, and boost collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hydrates the Body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You always need to make sure you’re drinking enough water. Lemon water hydrates the body and, especially first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, is an effective way to stimulate the metabolism. Another benefit of upgrading a glass of water with lemon juice? It can help you reach your water-intake goals. “[It] can give it a pleasant taste that makes [drinking plenty of water] easier,” says Parada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Reduces Anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lemon’s scent is more than just pleasant. Bensley points to a study where orthopedic surgery patients who used lemons as a form of aromatherapy experienced &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10290404/"&gt;lowered pre-procedure anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Though more studies need to be done to definitively prove its effect on anxiety and stress, wanting to take a whiff of lemon water before you drink it isn’t harmful if this has piqued your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Possibly Helps Maintain (or Lose) Weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary research suggests that lemon water is associated with weight loss. Bensley points to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581754/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that showed lemon polyphenols can suppress diet-induced obesity. “So while it may not help lose weight through its chemical properties, it can suppress the risk of obesity,” she says. But more studies are needed on the relationship between lemon water and weight loss. As with anything health related, experts always advise seeking medical advice from your doctor or health care provider to develop a safe plan to incorporate lemon water into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;May Help With Kidney-Stone Prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true for certain types of kidney stones. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola"}' href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Viola&lt;/a&gt;, DO, assistant professor of general internal medicine at Mount Sinai, explains that lemon water is high in citrate, a compound that binds to calcium in the urine and helps reduce the formation of crystals that can turn into stones. So drinking lemon water increases your urine volume and dilutes stone-forming substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Downsides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effects of lemon water are few, but there are certain things to keep in mind. Among all the benefits this offers, alkalizing is not one of them, says Parada. “It is often heard that lemon water could modify the pH of the blood with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/acidity-diet-symptoms-foods-to-add-to-alkalise-body"&gt;an alkalizing effect&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “However, this is false since it’s the kidneys, liver, and lungs that are in charge of regulating blood acidity, keeping it in a range of 7.3 to 7.5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bensley advises against drinking water with lemon on an empty stomach, as it can be acidic and worsen already existing digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux or frequent heartburn. She adds that the citric acid in lemons can worsen incontinence, as its acidity can irritate the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5rcE9TUmtzU1A4YzU1bHhqb01YdWV0TzRXa3FiN2dSYTNvR3cyeG9hUlotUC15UEdBQVI1aWpyOTNyTGc4dnRrWHd0UWowSzZfWWlYVENjSE9mR3M3ekk5ejFFSVVQZGc</guid></item><item><title>专家：使特立尼达和多巴哥更容易获得性传播感染药物-特立尼达和多巴哥新闻日</title><link>https://newsday.co.tt/2025/11/26/experts-make-sti-meds-more-readily-available-in-trinidad-and-tobago/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRINIDAD and Tobago must expand access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and doxycycline prophylaxis (doxy-prep) to combat HIV and rising sexually transmitted infections (STIs), health experts say, warning political, cultural, and religious barriers are slowing progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates speaking with Newsday on November 25 argue making these preventive tools widely available is not only a public health necessity but also a cost-effective strategy that empowers individuals to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne Weekes, Coordinator of the National HIV Helpline, described PrEP and doxy-prep as “extremely important” in the fight against HIV and STIs but said previous government approaches failed to prioritise prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The previous administration’s position failed to consider the preventative and trauma-informed benefits,” she said. “The reality is, whether the medication is available or not, people will still make their own choices, whether to have multiple partners or engage in unprotected sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, former health minister Terrence Deyalsingh opposed public access to PrEP, citing concerns it would encourage promiscuity. A stance criticised by many as him imposing personal beliefs on public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekes expressed hope the current administration will pursue comprehensive policy updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wide field that requires comprehensive reform,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her comments follow statements by Tobago House of Assembly Health Secretary Dr Faith Brebnor, who on November 20 urged for &lt;a href="https://newsday.co.tt/2025/11/21/brebnor-calls-for-hiv-prevention-medication-in-trinidad-and-tobago/"&gt;PrEP to be included&lt;/a&gt; in national HIV/AIDS prevention protocols. Brebnor made the remarks at a UNICEF event addressing rising syphilis cases among pregnant women and broader STI concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Pan American Health Organization event on November 18, Dr Adesh Sirjusingh, director of women’s health, reported nearly 200 cases of syphilis among pregnant women in 2025, far exceeding the typical 30–40 cases per year and surpassing the 100 cases reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trinidad and Tobago is one of the few countries in the Western Hemisphere where PrEP remains unavailable through public health programmes or on the open market,” Brebnor said. She noted the drug’s widespread use internationally as a preventive tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekes highlighted the global rise in syphilis and the impact of cuts to US funding for HIV/AIDS programmes, which previously accounted for 75 per cent of international financing. According to UNAIDS, an estimated 2.5 million people have lost access to HIV-prevention medicines, including PrEP, as clinics and community programmes close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if wider access to both drugs would strain the health system, Weekes said no. “In the long term, it actually reduces strain. It's about being proactive rather than reactive. Providing as many options as possible, ultimately saving resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAISO community case worker Rae Alibey echoed Weekes, stressing the importance of prevention tools for reducing stigma and empowering marginalised communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These tools empower people who are HIV-negative to have autonomy over their own sexual safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed prevention should not rely solely on people living with HIV, as the risk of transmission does not rest solely on their shoulders. Alibey noted accessibility remains a major issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The drugs exist but are not widely available to the public. It is not accessible over the counter, and obtaining it through a doctor can be difficult. Doxy-prep is sometimes given to medical professionals or sexual assault victims. Most people don’t know these options exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called on Health Minister Dr Lackram Bodoe to foster open, intelligence-led discussions and comprehensive sex education in schools, saying it is the only step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If people learn how to navigate these issues early, they are less likely to face harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He urged conversations, led by the Ministry of Health, based on reality and evidence, not conservative rhetoric for political mileage. He said people must understand the risks, the options, and the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibey said responsible conversations should include self-testing for HIV, understanding the correlation between syphilis and HIV, and awareness of additional layers of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Springer, an advocate for women and girls living with HIV in Trinidad and Tobago, highlighted how conservative societal attitudes hinder both access and national conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a very pretentious, conservative country. We don’t want to admit young people are having sex. We don’t want to acknowledge the LGBTQ community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springer pointed to gaps in sexual and reproductive health education, noting shortcomings in the Health and Family Life Education curriculum, which limits discussion on HIV and sexual health in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springer discussed socio-economic vulnerabilities affecting women. She said, Globally, 53 per cent of new HIV infections occur in women and girls, and in Trinidad and Tobago, the situation is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Cepep programme employed many women. Some of them may now be in positions where they cannot afford basic necessities, pushing them into risky behaviours and financial dependence on partners. We cannot ignore this reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stressed the need for both preventive drugs and long-acting treatments that are available internationally. Springer said women’s health is more than gynaecological check-ups or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It includes sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, and overall well-being. Introducing effective drugs and preventive programmes will reduce the long-term cost of treatment and care by lowering new HIV infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded that addressing HIV and STIs in the country requires more than a medical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need integrated approaches to tackle it effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said expanding access to both drugs, updating sex education, and fostering evidence-based national conversations are critical steps in controlling transmission rates. Failure to act, she warns, could see preventable infections rise further, compounding social and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsday reached out to the health minister, who said he would provide a response at a later time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
