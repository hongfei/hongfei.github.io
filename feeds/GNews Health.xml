&lt;p&gt;According to studies, girls who get their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/health/ive-had-my-period-for-1000-days-a-cute-clue-explains-why/"&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/a&gt; at a young age are more susceptible to long-term health problems. As a result, one mom is trying to prevent her young daughter’s body from maturing too soon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/early-menarche-jama-study-average-age-first-period/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;, over the past 55 years, young girls in the US have been getting their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/27/health/your-heavy-period-could-be-a-sign-of-this-blood-disorder/"&gt;periods&lt;/a&gt; earlier and earlier. Nowadays, the average age is 11 years and nine months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As if that age was startling enough, 16% of girls are getting their cycle before they even celebrate their 11th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

100vw, 885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Nowadays, the average age for a young girl to get her first period is 11 years and nine months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;zakalinka – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concerning part is that, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5052133/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, females who start their period at this young age have a 23% higher risk of developing different cancers — like breast, endometrial and ovarian — later on in life. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the increased risk of being diagnosed with serious illnesses down the road — another concern about early puberty is that young girls are forced to endure the emotional and physical toll periods can have before their brains and bodies are fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“…modern teens have to deal with painful periods, the risk of getting pregnant and sometimes actually getting pregnant well before their brains and bodies are actually mature enough,” Elena Bridgers, a mom of two and a wellness and mental health writer, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJR2aKioYaw/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent Instagram reel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this alarming news, moms like Rebecca Kinderman are trying to delay their daughter’s first period by following a holistic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I believe that if we can delay this part of ‘growing up,’ especially when their brains are not developed enough to be able to handle everything that they could be exposed to online, we are allowing our girls to stay young for longer,” Kinderman told &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/moms-are-trying-delay-daughters-first-period-experts-say-theyre-right-2075902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Newsweek.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old posted a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral Instagram reel&lt;/a&gt; where she explained her thought process in helping her daughter live a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Believing household toxins and poor diets are contributing factors to early periods, Kinderman stressed in her post that feeding your family whole foods without seed oils and artificial ingredients is major. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And in the era of parents raising “iPad kids,” the mom also stressed the importance of removing kids from their tech devices and encouraging them to get outside and play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it seems that Kinderman might have a point — especially regarding diets and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that that is very reflective of the obesity epidemic that we are seeing,” Aviva Sopher, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, Irving Medical Center, told Stat News. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, this is concerning as well, this kind of confluence of obesity and earlier puberty and more irregular cycles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/ways-to-maximize-walking-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t appear to be an intense workout, it could be your key to belly fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Walking for just 30 minutes per day is all you need to reap the benefits of physical activity,” Denise writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/walk-off-belly-fat-" target="_blank"&gt;her website&lt;/a&gt;. “It can be as effective (if not more so) than jogging. While walking, you can burn fat, boost your metabolism, and/or lose weight. Exactly how much you get out of it will depend on the intensity of your walks and what other healthy habits you’re practicing during the rest of your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise even has a workout program specifically dedicated to walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 4-Week Walking Challenge encourages you to walk every day for 30 minutes, along with quick, mini-workouts to tone up your whole body—it’s one of my most popular challenges, so join today for free!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase the intensity of your walks to speed up the fat burn, consider performing bodyweight exercises, wearing a rucksack or ankle weights, switching up the terrain, and including inclines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In general, belly fat wraps around your organs like the liver and belly, and is called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-increase-visceral-fat-burn-while-walking/" target="_blank"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to subcutaneous fat, which is closer to your skin),” Denise explains. “To tackle this visceral fat, you need to add some targeted moves to your workouts. You will want to add core moves that both elongate and constrict the abdominal muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/blast-belly-fat-with-yoga" target="_blank"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt;, “Yoga is especially helpful for targeting the belly and belly fat—yoga moves target tone the abs without sit ups, and works all parts of the midsection—the abs, waistline, and the deep fat within the belly area. So try this yoga workout and watch the belly fat melt away!”&lt;/p&gt;

I have requested a transfer from my job so we can get out of this podunk shithole ASAP. Do you have any advice for dealing with the rude quips from the local yokels until then?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7dl001i3b76u0kl90ff@published"&gt;If you really don’t care about these opinions, stay committed to that attitude. Let them talk. Either ignore them or tell them that you don’t care. Know that they’re wrong and instead of worrying yourself about the principle of the way they’re treating you and your girlfriend, focus on the practice that will complicate your lives the least. You could even offer solidarity: “I’m slutty, too” or, “I know, isn’t she amazing?” This may put the target on you for mockery as well, but again, who cares what these people think?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ge001j3b768z1sd7we@published"&gt;You could also take the drag-queen route and read them right back. Try clap-backs along the lines of: “Wow, you must really have nothing going on in your life that you’re concerned about my girlfriend’s teenage sex life,” or “You’re a little overly concerned with a teen’s sex life, don’t you think?,” or “Jealous, much?” Of course, this would serve to escalate the situation while dragging you down to their level. Because this could cause further complications and on the principle that it would actively bring more ugliness into the world, I’d tread lightly but you could do it. Many people won’t let things go beyond words and you will soon never see these people again so shutting them up aggressively might feel good and not be very complicated at all, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7m2001l3b76uaftnr0b@published"&gt;I have an embarrassing penis problem. I am 66 now. I have always been a “grower”—that is, I add a lot of length and girth when I get hard. As I have aged—and now moved to a hot climate—my ball sack has just grown larger. I thought it was a myth, but apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ou001m3b767b3kup0s@published"&gt;Now when I sit the wrong way, or exercise the wrong way, my penis pretty much disappears into the ball sack. And it feels terrible. I end up adjusting myself all the time. I can move my penis to one side and my ball sack to the other, but if I move around more it hurts. I’ve tried several types of underwear: pouches, boxer briefs, and regular boxers. But nothing helps for long. Anything that holds my genital area ends up smushing (technical term) my penis. Can your experts think of anything to fix this? Cock rings work, but I can’t wear them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

You seem to be describing a condition known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16291-buried-penis"&gt;buried penis&lt;/a&gt;. There are some non-invasive treatments for it like weight loss and steroid creams for those who experience buried penis as a result of tight skin around the penis, but for some, surgery may be the only effective treatment option. Sometimes this surgery can come in the form of a tummy tuck or suction lipectomy, which removes fat from around the genital region. There is also the possibility of removing scrotal tissue when that is the culprit of buried penis, as it is in your case. It’s unclear what’s causing your discomfort, but that’s not uncommon with buried penis and sometimes is the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-sclerosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20374448"&gt;lichen sclerosus&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that can result in thin, patchy, and/or discolored skin that is typically treated with ointment.&lt;/p&gt;

In an email, he told me that it “seems a little too convenient to blame this on just the weather,” and indeed buried penis is typically caused by weight gain or “some sort of intrascrotal process like a hydrocele making the scrotum grow bigger and envelop the penis.” The doctor’s recommendation? See a doctor. Granted, this may seem daunting given your embarrassment, but doctors see issues like this all the time. It’s worth sucking it up to ameliorate your discomfort and, yes, potential embarrassment moving forward. If telling one person could save you years of grief, that seems like a no-brainer trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag86e001s3b76so8kfi2r@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for more than 20 years. We love each other and are extremely happy together. Recently, she went through some health and work issues, and our sex life waned, but now that both are resolved, it’s picked back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag896001t3b76bvqiu3eq@published"&gt;We’ve had many conversations over the years about our shared belief in ethical nonmonogamy and giving it a try. They’ve escalated lately. About a decade ago, with my permission, she slept with a longtime acquaintance. Until recently, that was it. In the past few months, it became apparent a mutual friend was interested in her, and with our spark back, I encouraged her to go for it if she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8c0001u3b76g9xd26v8@published"&gt;She did, and she loved the experience. I’m happy for her! She’s now encouraging me to try it, too. She’s particularly excited about it because she’s the only sexual partner I’ve ever had (I grew up in a strict household, and in a religion that instilled a lot of shame, and I was a shy, unconfident, late bloomer). She keeps telling me: “I don’t want to be the only person you ever have sex with!” Great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8ev001v3b766v0zixrt@published"&gt;The problem is, while I’m eager to try it, I have no idea where to start. Because she loves me and is attracted to me, she doesn’t realize there is a big opportunity gap between us. She is beautiful, outgoing, witty, charming, and easily attracts people. As I’ve aged, I’ve gained weight and lost hair. She regularly is thought to be 15 years younger, while I definitely look my age. Plus, I’m just naturally more shy and reserved. She tells me often that I’m a kind, thoughtful person and that I’m good in bed, but I do not exude (sexual) energy like she does, and do not have acquaintances coming up to me asking if we’re open and can we sleep together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8jj001w3b76v6pbgech@published"&gt;I know this is going to require work on my part to get out of my comfort zone and put myself out there. But it seems likely to me that if I do this, it’s probably going to start with someone I don’t know yet (which she’s OK with). So, I’m wondering if you can suggest some apps or websites (or just give me any useful insight) on how to meet some like-minded people? We’ve discussed, down the road, perhaps trying threesomes or partner-swapping, but for now, I’m just trying to figure out how to get my “body count” to two.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8rw001z3b76bypdvp4k@published"&gt;Some of what you’re worried about is easy enough to work on. If you aren’t exercising regularly, that’s a great place to start. It can help with your mental as well as physical health and affect your body composition. Working out may also give you the kind of glow that many find attractive as it silently telegraphs health. In addition to the gains, you may find your confidence lifted, which can also attract people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="238" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8up00203b76824ix9z4@published"&gt;I think that’s key here: You need a boost of that kind of self-esteem. It can be learned via a fake-it-till-you-make-it approach. Even if you don’t feel confident, carry yourself like you are and you may start to be naturally, once you feel the effects of this disposition. Confidence begets confidence. Also, you’re a guy, which means you have a bit more wiggle room in terms of looking your age and still being considered attractive. That’s male privilege, and while beauty standards are changing for men, things like crows feet and thinning hair are not held against men’s appearance to the extent that they are women’s. It’s not fair, but it’s the way things are at the moment. If nothing else, tuck that in your back pocket and use it so as not to be hard on yourself. The other side of the gender norms is that men are still largely expected to be the pursuers of sex. That’s changing, too, but it could explain a bit as to why your wife is being hit on when you are not. Sure, she may be hot, but in your letter, I see you repeatedly talking down to yourself. Realism is important and self-awareness is a rare commodity, but negative self-talk can get in the way of you trying to move forward on your ENM path here. I’m just trying to dismantle some of the blockades you have set up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8xi00213b76bntrbwto@published"&gt;Feeld is the go-to app for ethical non-monogamy. If you have kinks, consider Fetlife (though you’re likely to have luck on Feeld, as well, given the amount of kinksters on it). Tinder has a meat-market reputation, so that may work for you, and sites like OKCupid and &lt;a href="http://match.com"&gt;match.com&lt;/a&gt; have been around for so long that they cover ENM bases as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag90e00223b7685eelnrl@published"&gt;You could also try threesomes or partner-swapping as opposed to finding new partners on your own. Your wife is more experienced, and you claim she’s hotter, so you might have better luck looking for extra partners together. Group sex isn’t for everyone, and there are plenty of ENM couples that play separately, but unless you have good reasons for doing it that way (beyond the tit-for-tat reason that she’s already experienced it solo and so should you), I recommend cruising together. On apps like Feeld, you can link profiles with your partner so that the interested can check both of you out to see what they’re getting. You may also consider swingers clubs/groups or sex clubs. These spaces can be overwhelming, sure, but they can also allow you to feel out vibes and kind of get in the ENM headspace. You don’t have to have sex when you go—you can just hang out and watch. That might be the easiest way for you to dip your toe in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbagu3d002a3b76edzfpw6t@published"&gt;I don’t have a problem with porn, but I’m realizing I have a problem with the way my husband watches it. Last week, I asked him to play some music from his phone by pairing it with the TV, and a porn video sprang up. I immediately lurched to cover our 8-year-old’s eyes, but the incident stuck with me. I think he’s watching way more porn than I know, and probably lying to me about it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/porn-addiction-signs-husband-watching-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of these people, more than half reported suffering from rectal bleeding, a warning sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Cannon, the medical oncologist who led the research, told DailyMail.com that the results were higher than what doctors would expect in the general population and warranted further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that any long-distance runners experiencing warning signs of colon cancer, such as rectal bleeding, should get tested for the disease, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was observational so it is not clear if distance running raises the risk of if other lifestyle factors like diet play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Cannon suggested it could be because running long periods causes blood to be directed away from the colon to the legs, raising the risk of cell death and damaging mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is colon cancer patient Phil Decker in January 2025, pictured running a marathon with Alecia Allen. He was getting ready to run a marathon when he was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radwah Oda never thought she could get cancer as we was in 'excellent health' at the time of her diagnosis at age 33. She was working out five times a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: '&lt;span&gt;As a colon cancer oncologist, I had seen several patients die of colon cancer that were in their 30s that ran ultramarathons, which were 50km or higher runs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We did this study because we were concerned that these runners were/are diverting all their blood flow to their legs during runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And [then are having] infarcts in their colon, and a lot of cell turnover; the cells die and then turn over very quickly [meaning] there may be more risk of cancer causing mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infarcts are area of dead tissue caused by a loss of blood supply. When blood flow is blocked or severely reduced —usually by a clot, embolism, or narrowed vessels — the affected tissue doesn't get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, and it dies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is just the latest explanation being put forward by scientists to explain the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761627/colon-cancer-rates-linked-alcohol-smoking-young-people.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer cases among those under 50 years old&lt;/a&gt;, with those born in the 1980s now having double the risk of being diagnosed with the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether long-distance running may also be linked to a higher risk of other cancers that are rising in young people, like in the pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many young colon cancer patients &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;have been shocked by their diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, saying they are young, healthy and - they thought - were doing everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients include Laurie Koshers, a vegetarian who ran every day, but was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 44 years, and marathon runner John B. Johnson, who was diagnosed at 35 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study was carried out in memory of two patients - Josh Wadlington and Spencer 'Trigg' Robbins - who both battled colon cancer despite running marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was presented at ASCO 2025 in Chicago, Illinois, the world's largest gathering of cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lee Rawlinson, who previously ran marathons, learned that his grandfather had pancreatic cancer and he carries a 'dodgy gene'. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Holly Shawyer, 35, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year despite being in peak shape and training for a marathon. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I have always been pretty health conscious – watching what I eat and regularly exercising. I rarely got sick, maybe once every few years I would get a stomach bug,' Ms Shawyer said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients aged 35 to 50 years old who were ultramarathon runners were recruited for the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was defined as people who had completed at least two marathons of 50 kilometers (31 miles) or more, or five marathons of at least 42km (26.2miles) or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had inflammatory bowel disease or other conditions linked to colon cancer were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, participants had an average age of 42 years, 55 percent were female and they reported running around 32 to 64km (20 to 40 miles) every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between October 2022 and December 2024, patients underwent a colonoscopy - a screening for colon cancer where a flexible tube with a small camera on the end is placed into the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon said they were still investigating other factors that may have put them at risk of developing pre-cancerous polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary results had shown that runners ate at least five energy bars and also consumed gels daily - which are highly processed foods, with foods in this category previously being linked to a higher risk of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laurie Koshers (left) was diagnosed with colon cancer after 'doing everything right'. She is a vegetarian and also would run every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising among under 50 year olds, even as they fall in older age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon added: 'I think that i would get a colonoscopy if you have blood from your stool, even if you are not at the age yet where colonoscopies are approved - or at least i would ask your doctor for one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think bleeding from the rectum in runners is dismissed because it is a known entity, runners colitis is known, and it hasn't been known to be associated with cancer, so it is often dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But my hope is that, with more awareness, people who run long distance and have bleeding will go get a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In our study, most of the people who were having advanced adenomas were having blood in their stools.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6574107/Colorectal-cancer-rates-deaths-soaring-especially-young-adults.html"&gt;estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:49:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQUWh0T3ppbnhacXEtZldVTVlKOG4wYUNBdFN0R2diNUhCRHkwNjF4Z19Dc2I3aEVXQ29pSURUOEVtek9OcTVDdW1LTTRjb1FFdFNGUG83QXZwbzFsbGhuQ3d0clg2TlAtLVdDdTVuYXNkR29FQUVKQ2tyOHlxMlU2c1dTa1hHQnhaTHZZUGdMRko</guid></item><item><title>与心脏损伤重大风险直接相关的任何形式的大麻使用- Earth.com | Cannabis use in any form directly linked to significant risk of heart damage - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana has long been debated as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Some people view it as a benign stress-reliever with fewer hazards than tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from a recent study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by first author Leila Mohammadi, MD, PhD, and senior author Matthew L. Springer, PhD, at the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-users-and-heart-damage"&gt;Cannabis users and heart damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study followed 55 participants who were already cannabis users or individuals who did not use any nicotine &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-changes-from-cannabis-last-at-least-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;. Each cannabis user had a habit of consuming it at least three times a week for at least one year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group included smokers who averaged around 10 years of use and those who used &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; in edible form with around five years of use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonsmoking control group showed healthier cardiovascular indicators than any of the cannabis-using groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers uncovered decreased blood vessel function in participants who either smoked marijuana or took edibles containing the psychoactive compound in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cannabis-sativa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found vascular function in those using either type of cannabis was roughly half that of nonusers. This was linked to higher chances of &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/blood-heart-circulation/endothelial-dysfunction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to impaired operations of the cells lining blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-blood-vessel-damage"&gt;Cannabis-linked blood vessel damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood vessels lose flexibility or responsiveness, that can heighten the likelihood of conditions such as heart attacks and hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some previous &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.103.23.2805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; have also associated marijuana use with possible triggers for cardiovascular complications. The current study adds more data to consider for those who routinely depend on cannabis for relaxation or pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential link between endothelial dysfunction and cannabis use raises concerns about early development of vascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition involves impaired nitric oxide production and reduced elasticity in the arteries, both of which influence how well blood moves around the body. If this process falters too much, people may face a spike in heart-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Smoking cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that marijuana smokers had distinct changes in their blood serum that were harmful to cells lining blood vessels. Those taking edibles, however, did not display the same harmful shift in serum properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might indicate that the act of burning and inhaling &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-potency-cannabis-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; smoke triggers certain biochemical pathways not activated by ingesting THC in food or beverage form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both methods still resulted in diminished vessel function, but the underlying mechanisms appeared to vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens the door for closer evaluation of how inhaled cannabis influences nitric oxide and other chemicals in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have tried to pinpoint how THC might harm vessels, but these findings suggest there are yet-to-be-mapped pathways involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlight the need for more research to understand how different routes of use impact the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Eating cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12412838/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have drawn parallels between marijuana smoking and tobacco use when it comes to cardiovascular strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both involve inhaling combusted materials that may generate oxidizing particles and other toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that while chronic users of edibles also showed diminished endothelial function, it did not seem tied to changes in blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; may cause adverse cardiovascular effects through interactions with cannabinoid receptors in the heart or blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible users might be experiencing those effects in a way that bypasses the bloodstream’s immediate signaling changes linked to smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also hint that inhalation may carry a bigger immediate impact on serum factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-all-of-this-mean"&gt;What does all of this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people view &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-cannabis-helped-patients-feel-better-for-a-full-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;edibles&lt;/a&gt; as a safer alternative to smoking. Edibles do avoid the dangers of inhaling combusted matter, yet the overall vascular function among both smoking and non-smoking users in the study was still notably reduced compared to nonusers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a cautionary sign for anyone who feels that avoiding smoke means avoiding all serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical or recreational users might want to stay alert to these issues. Some individuals turn to cannabis for relief from pain or anxiety, but this research indicates a need for awareness about cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider could be wise, especially for those with a family history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-health-cannabis-and-the-future"&gt;Heart health, cannabis, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team noted that the specific mechanisms behind THC’s effect on blood vessels remain somewhat unclear. They observed that smoking marijuana affects blood vessel function in ways distinct from ingesting THC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means new research should aim to pin down which components of smoke, vapor, or other byproducts may be most harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are likely to explore whether occasional marijuana use carries the same risk as chronic use. More data on dosage levels and individual differences could help the medical community develop more precise guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current work sets the stage for larger population studies that can track cardiovascular parameters over longer timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular health is a lifelong matter. This research shows that both edible users and smokers should keep an eye on how cannabis might impact their heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caution makes sense until medical professionals reach a clearer understanding of how best to reduce any risks linked to routine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:16:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA</guid></item><item><title>铁天然存在于这10种食物中-印度时报 | Iron is naturally present in these 10 foods - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;​10 reasons why spinach deserves a spot ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;9 fast and easy mini-workouts to reduce ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在埃及石棺中发现的银河系最古老的描绘- Earth.com | Oldest depiction of the Milky Way galaxy discovered in an Egyptian sarcophagus - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest known depiction of our galaxy may come from a coffin that once held an ancient Egyptian priestess. Thousands of years ago, early observers around the Nile watched the night sky and recorded what they saw in ways that still surprise people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cosmic understanding went beyond casual observation, given the care they took in mapping stars and planetary positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts shaped myths and religious beliefs that included powerful deities who represented the sky itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of such a depiction was proposed by &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/or-graur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Or Grauer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explored museum collections for images of Nut, the Egyptian goddess of the sky, and found an unexpected detail on a coffin belonging to &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/83189270/Inner_coffin_of_Nesitaudjatakhet_from_the_collection_of_the_National_Museum_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan_Kazan_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nesitaudjatakhet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egyptians-and-the-night-sky"&gt;Egyptians and the night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; society thrived along the banks of the Nile, where seasonal floods influenced farming and daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night sky became a reference point for these rhythms, prompting the Egyptians to begin making &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;detailed observations&lt;/a&gt; of celestial patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priests tracked the rising and setting of stars to guide religious events, marking out constellations with local symbolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicists and historians now suggest these same patterns shaped how the Egyptians understood their gods and the wider firmament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one striking coffin scene, &lt;a href="https://egyptianmuseum.org/deities-nut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nut’s figure&lt;/a&gt; arches over the earth, with an undulating curve traced from her fingertips to her toes. This dark curve cuts through the stars on her body, leaving some above and others below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comparison with a photograph of the Milky Way shows the striking similarity between the wavy curve that runs through Nut’s body and the wavy curve created by the dark nebulae that make up the Great Rift,” said Dr. Grauer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to match &lt;a href="https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2024/04/the-great-rift.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the Great Rift&lt;/a&gt;, which is the band of interstellar dust that seems to bisect the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepening-our-view-of-nut"&gt;Deepening our view of nut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nut was often pictured as the entire Egyptian night sky, she did not always show a visible reference to the Milky Way. Many coffin artworks depict her naked or clothed but typically avoid that wavy band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature in Nesitaudjatakhet’s coffin stands out because the curve is thick, dark, and divides her starry form. This is why some experts now consider it the earliest known artistic sign of the Milky Way in &lt;a href="https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/fisher-blog/iconography-ancient-egyptian-funerary-objects-cartonnage-papyri-fisher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Egyptian funeral iconography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Nut’s representation involved the path of the Sun and stars as she swallowed them at dusk and birthed them at dawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egyptians also described the sky in texts that link it to a “Winding Waterway,” which some believe could be a name for our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faint dust clouds that form the Great Rift are easy to notice under dark skies, so it is possible that ancient astronomers saw this feature splitting the glow of the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they specifically labeled it as a cosmic river or associated it with Nut’s form remains a point of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-religion-and-astronomy"&gt;Connecting religion and astronomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge carved and painted into these burial items reflects a society that saw religion and astronomy as one connected system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-lotus-unraveling-an-egyptian-psychedelic-mystery/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; night sky lore spanned the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, with deities representing cosmic forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s cosmic curve is just another reminder of how carefully people watched the heavens in earlier times. Today, it serves as both a historical clue and a symbol of human curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084423/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084430/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1s.webp" alt="The Book of the Day from the tomb of Ramesses VI (KV 09).

In classical Greece, it was called the “Galaxy,” rooted in legends of milk sprayed across the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egyptian-mummies-still-carry-their-original-scents/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; approach put the galaxy within a goddess’s silhouette, linking cosmic wonder to stories of birth and rebirth. This bond between visual art and faith explains why coffins became a central place for these images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to the 21st and 22nd Dynasties as times of vibrant coffin designs, combining older funerary customs with new artistic ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burial sets often had layers, each with religious scenes that showed various deities and protective formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person like Nesitaudjatakhet, who served as a musician and chantress, held a high rank in temple society. The images around her final resting place likely merged theology with cosmic symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egypt-and-the-ancient-night-sky"&gt;Egypt and the ancient night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who research early astronomy continue to wonder if Egyptian priests fully understood the galaxy’s shape or only noticed its brighter patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the Great Rift suggests they recognized distinct zones in the band of light crossing the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of whether the “&lt;a href="https://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?1,71210,71223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Winding Waterway&lt;/a&gt;” refers to that dark split within the glowing path. Though we may never know their exact thoughts, the coffin detail hints that they observed far more than modern assumptions might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without telescopes, ancient stargazers formed complex ideas about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-ever-recorded-planetary-engulfment-event-captured-by-webb/"&gt;planetary&lt;/a&gt; alignments and seasonal changes. They excelled at linking natural cycles to myths, weaving them into every aspect of life and the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s starry figure and that striking curve demonstrate how ancient theology and observation blended into a single story. It is an unusual view of the sky that still holds our attention today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://dds.sciengine.com/cfs/files/pdfs/view/1440-2807/CF0632CF1DDF408F8BA140B965EF95B6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2</guid></item><item><title>试验发现，锻炼“优于药物”以阻止癌症在治疗后复发-《卫报》 | Exercise ‘better than drugs’ to stop cancer returning after treatment, trial finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of cancer patients dying by a third, stop tumours coming back and is even more effective than drugs, according to the results of a landmark trial that could transform health guidelines worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For decades, doctors have recommended adopting a healthy lifestyle to lower the risk of developing cancer.

I would have retitled it Better than a Drug, because you don’t have all the side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s the same magnitude of benefit of many drugs that get approved for this kind of magnitude of benefit – 28% decreased risk of occurrence, 37% decreased risk of death. Drugs get approved for less than that, and they’re expensive and they’re toxic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When I started three decades ago it was still the era where we’d be gentle and say, don’t overdo yourself when you’re on chemo. We’ve reversed that,” she added. “I would say [exercise is] better than a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Bowel cancer rising among under-50s worldwide, research finds","elementId":"b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/bowel-cancer-rising-under-50s-worldwide-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, researchers enrolled 889 colon cancer patients between 2009 and 2023. Most (90%) had stage three disease. Patients were randomly assigned to take part in a structured exercise programme (445) or to just receive a healthy lifestyle booklet (444).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those in the exercise group worked with a personal trainer twice a month for coaching sessions and supervised exercise sessions, and later once a month, for a total of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The exercise group were coached and supported to help them achieve set exercise goals. Their weekly target was the equivalent of three to four walks of between 45 and 60 minutes, but patients could choose how they got more active. Some went kayaking or skiing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After five years, patients in the exercise group had a 28% lower risk of recurrent or new cancers than those in the other group. After eight years, the same patients also had a 37% lower risk of dying than those just handed the healthy lifestyle booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“After completing surgery and chemotherapy, about 30% of patients with high-risk stage two and stage three colon cancer will eventually experience recurrence of their disease,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Christopher Booth, of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “As oncologists, one of the most common questions we get asked by patients is ‘what else can I do to improve my outcome?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These results now provide us with a clear answer: an exercise programme that includes a personal trainer will reduce the risk of recurrent or new cancer, make you feel better and help you live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Charles Swanton, the chief clinician of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which funded the UK arm of the study, said: “This fascinating study captures the power of exercise to transform people’s health and boost their chances of surviving cancer after treatment. For an intervention that isn’t a drug, exercise offers remarkable benefits for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0aa03320-9adf-4260-8bee-308ac224c504" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Early morning and evening activity could ‘reduce bowel cancer risk by 11%’","elementId":"0aa03320-9adf-4260-8bee-308ac224c504","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/06/early-morning-and-evening-activity-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For some patients, “physical activity can be a gamechanger that shifts the course of their recovery”, Swanton added. “The findings suggest that oncologists should consider recommending a structured exercise programme after surgery to improve people’s chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it’s important to remember that exercise isn’t the best option for everyone. My advice to cancer patients is to speak to your doctor before taking on any new physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings are likely to change global practice, with doctors worldwide urged to discuss exercise regimens with their patients following treatment, oncologists in Chicago said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While this study followed only colon cancer patients, Gralow said there was no reason to think the findings would not be applicable across other cancers. Booth said trials for other cancers would be needed, but added that data from this study suggested there were lower breast and prostate cancer occurrences in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Exercise as an intervention is a no-brainer and should be implemented broadly,” said Dr Pamela Kunz, of Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said it was “really exciting” that tailored exercise after treatment could be “life-changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These landmark findings suggest that focused steps to exercise, from walks to workouts, could help turbocharge the body’s ability to prevent cancer returning after treatment and help save more lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Being more active can have significant benefits in helping maintain a healthy weight, strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation and lift mood – and it’s now really encouraging to see that exercise really could have the power to help more people survive cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y</guid></item><item><title>卫星首次测量河流波浪--《华盛顿邮报》 | Satellite measures river flow waves for the first time - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPSGZBNEU3bU9Ib1JERzA3NmdIdktWdXFJQWktcFF4cVJIdzRPQTlyeFZaWjRMdTZBSUF5bE5VZDBLd3ktcVpCa1JfU3c0dDZ6Z0FSNWpBYXBncHQ4MzNiTHktMkdLcW51ejYtSzA1SEVuZUNuTWt1UGx3cnREd0FfaFl2VUNTOWo0a2g5RHJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ANLMHNKTZFD7MC3L23IT7AUIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Long river waves, known as flow waves, have been measured by satellite for the first time, researchers announced May 14, a breakthrough that could expand understanding of river dynamics, floods and the other hazards sometimes present when the waves form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQ7ZILS7CJGK5LF2L4GDFLWCDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113875" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers found that the long waves can be spotted and studied using data from a NASA-French space agency satellite designed to study Earth’s water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UEKR5WO72BAJ7KYQTI2VRDOVUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study used satellite data from the &lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/overview/?page=0&amp;amp;per_page=40&amp;amp;order=position+asc&amp;amp;search=&amp;amp;hover=false&amp;amp;show_institution=true&amp;amp;show_email=false&amp;amp;category=214" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)&lt;/a&gt; mission.

The hormone doesn’t just raise or lower self-esteem—it actually changes how much social evaluation influences a person’s moment-to-moment feelings of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research sheds light on how testosterone shapes what psychologists call “state self-esteem”—a person’s temporary sense of self-worth that fluctuates in response to social cues. The results could help explain why men with lower self-esteem sometimes show increased vulnerability to mood disturbances or antisocial behavior. The study also opens the door to potential new treatment strategies that combine hormonal and behavioral approaches to boost mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem isn’t static. While people often talk about self-esteem as a fixed trait, psychologists distinguish between trait self-esteem, which reflects someone’s overall self-worth, and state self-esteem, which can rise or fall in response to recent experiences. These fluctuations can have real consequences. People with low or unstable self-esteem are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and even aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s self-esteem, in particular, may be more sensitive to changes in social status or perceived rejection. Previous research has suggested that testosterone, a sex hormone known to influence dominance behavior and sensitivity to status, might also affect self-esteem. But the evidence has been mixed. Some studies have shown that testosterone increases self-esteem in certain groups, such as men with low baseline levels, while others have found no clear link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to provide more precise evidence by focusing on how testosterone changes the process of self-esteem updating. In other words, do men on testosterone respond differently when they receive approval or disapproval from others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 120 healthy young men, aged 18 to 26, and randomly assigned them to receive either a dose of testosterone gel or a placebo. The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the real hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the gel, participants waited three hours to allow testosterone levels to rise. They then completed a task designed to mimic real-world social evaluation. Before the experiment, each participant provided personal information used to create a profile. They were told that 184 strangers would view this profile and either approve or disapprove of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the task, participants predicted whether they would receive approval from each “rater” and then received feedback in the form of a thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or no response. After every few trials, they rated how good they felt about themselves at that moment. This rating served as a measure of state self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the participants, the feedback they received was pre-programmed. Raters were grouped into categories with different approval probabilities: very likely (85% approval), somewhat likely (70%), somewhat unlikely (30%), or very unlikely (15%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that testosterone changed how participants formed expectations about social feedback. Men who received testosterone were more optimistic when anticipating approval from high-approval raters, but also more pessimistic with raters known to give negative feedback. In other words, testosterone sharpened the contrast between positive and negative social expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, testosterone also made men more sensitive to the feedback itself. When men in the testosterone group received positive feedback, their self-esteem increased more than it did in the placebo group. But when they received negative feedback, their self-esteem dropped more sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand these patterns, the researchers used computational modeling. They applied a model that treats self-esteem updating as a learning process—similar to how people adjust their beliefs based on feedback in other situations, like predicting rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model showed that participants on testosterone gave more weight to two key components: their expectation of social approval and the difference between what they expected and what they actually received, also known as a prediction error. This suggests that testosterone enhances the brain’s attention to social outcomes, making people more responsive to the highs and lows of social evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while testosterone increased sensitivity to both approval and disapproval, it did not affect the basic learning rate—that is, how quickly people adjusted their beliefs based on prediction errors. Instead, testosterone influenced the importance participants assigned to the feedback and their expectations when forming self-esteem judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings help explain why testosterone is often linked with behaviors related to social dominance or status. If testosterone heightens sensitivity to approval and rejection, it could amplify the motivation to seek positive social outcomes—or avoid negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support the idea that self-esteem functions like a “sociometer,” tracking how accepted or rejected someone feels. Testosterone appears to modulate this system, increasing the emotional impact of social signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has clinical implications too. Low self-esteem is linked to a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal. In some cases, testosterone therapy has been used to treat mood symptoms in men with low testosterone. This study suggests that combining testosterone with positive social environments or feedback-based therapies might improve self-esteem more effectively than either approach alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study had some limitations. All participants were young men, so it’s unclear whether the findings would generalize to women or to older adults. Some studies have found that testosterone affects men and women differently, especially in social and emotional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also did not measure participants’ natural testosterone levels before the experiment. Since baseline levels may influence how people respond to additional testosterone, future studies could examine whether individual differences in hormone levels change the effect of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the artificial nature of the task. While the social feedback was designed to mimic real-world interactions, participants knew they were in a study and may have reacted differently than they would in daily life. Nonetheless, the task captured meaningful fluctuations in self-esteem and allowed for precise measurement of the psychological processes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how testosterone affects social learning in more natural settings or in people with mental health conditions linked to low self-esteem. It could also investigate whether similar effects occur with other hormones or in response to different kinds of feedback, such as praise from peers or criticism from authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.008" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Testosterone Administration Increases the Computational Impact of Social Evaluation on the Updating of State Self-Esteem&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jixin Long, Junsong Lu, Yang Hu, Philippe N.

The wavelength determines the color and energy of the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human eye can only perceive a small section of this spectrum, approximately the range between 400 and 700 nanometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, we humans are unable to see the infrared range, with its longer wavelengths of 750 nanometers to one millimeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to see infrared light, we have needed comparatively bulky night-vision goggles or night-vision devices with their own energy source — until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Infrared contact lenses from China&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei, eastern &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china/t-18480887"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, have now &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/eyeing-sustainability-contact-lenses-vs-glasses/a-68732079"&gt;developed a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; that converts infrared light into visible light, enabling humans to see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuqian Ma and his team have combined conventional soft contact lenses with 45 nanometer particles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium and erbium ions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, the team wrote in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nanoparticles enrich the long infrared light waves with energy. In doing so, they convert infrared light into three primary colors, making them visible to the human eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — In Good Shape — Look me in the eyes!" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;In Good Shape — Look me in the eyes!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-71539087" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="71539087" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/57488401_605.webp" data-duration="26:04"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/igs/igs20250207_gesamtNEU_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/igs/igs20250207_gesamtNEU_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/71561079" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH" default&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/track&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One drawback is that the resulting images are very blurred because the nanoparticles in the lenses scatter the light, which the team was able to partially compensate for by adding additional lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the infrared contact lenses are still nowhere near as powerful as night vision goggles, which amplify weak infrared signals, making them visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Even better vision with eyes closed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team first injected nanoparticles into the retinas of mice and their behavior showed that they could see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly developed contact lenses are much more practical because they are non-invasive — meaning no injections into our retinas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tests, humans were able to recognize patterns, letters and flashing infrared signals in the dark. And the infrared lenses work even better with closed eyes, because the infrared light can easily penetrate the eyelids and image generation is not disturbed by normal visible light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Animal infrared capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several animal species are able to perceive infrared light, which is extremely helpful when hunting in the dark. They do not see infrared light as "light" in the sense of human vision. Instead they perceive the heat radiation emitted by objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="image-gallery embed" data-id="46086225"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps some cold-blooded reptiles such as snakes (rattlesnakes and pit vipers), certain fish (&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pet-savages-bet-you-never-knew-piranhas-were-shy-easily-startled-and-conservative/a-19263199"&gt;piranhas&lt;/a&gt; and cichlids), some amphibians (bullfrogs) and some blood-sucking insects (mosquitoes and bugs) with orientation or hunting in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm-blooded animals — such as humans, other mammals and birds — cannot see infrared light because their eyes do not have the appropriate receptors and their body's own heat radiation would also interfere with the perception of infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Big question about the benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fascinating as the Chinese innovation is, it remains to be seen how it could be used in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the developers, the lenses could be used in surgical procedures, in the field of encryption or &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cryptocurrency/t-64077796"&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, or for counterfeit protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because infrared light is what makes invisible features or inks visible on documents, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lenses could also be used to rescue people in poor visibility conditions because they make heat-emitting objects visible. However, many critics doubt this, as night vision devices are much easier to use, and are also significantly more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. did last week when he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/" rel&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a $766 million government &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" rel&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to develop a new bird flu vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contract was with Moderna, the Massachusetts-based biotech company that developed and continues to produce one of the original COVID-19 shots. The Biden administration &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/hhs-awards-moderna-176-million-develop-mrna-h5-avian-flu-vaccine" rel&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the contract last year, through a special government program designed to fund preparation for future public health threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moderna was trying to use its know-how from COVID to invent a vaccine platform it could deploy rapidly against several types of influenza, including the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cdc-review-two-more-us-h5n1-viruses-similar-earlier-assessments" rel&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; bird flu—a version of which, if you haven’t heard, has spread to the United States and is ravaging poultry farms. But it’s not the price of eggs keeping infectious-disease doctors up at night. It’s the possibility that a strain mutates, jumps species, and ends up in humans, who then start transmitting it to each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s happened before, in mostly isolated outbreaks, with mortality rates that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html#:~:text=Historically%2C%20the%20mortality%20rate%20from,date%20has%20resulted%20in%20death." rel&gt;reached 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That dwarfs the comparable figure for COVID-19, which in most countries was in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality" rel&gt;low single digits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and yet still killed more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" rel&gt;7 million people around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totaldeaths_select_00" rel&gt;more than a million in the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That death toll would have been even higher if not for speedy development of COVID vaccines, including Moderna’s, whose secret sauce is mRNA technology that generally allows for much quicker production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; That’s why two of the scientists most responsible for the breakthrough won the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/" rel&gt;Nobel Prize in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And it’s why that bird flu contract went to Moderna, whose early tests on the bird flu vaccine have already produced promising &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5967069" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the contract was through the Department of Health and Human Services, which thanks to Donald Trump is under the leadership of Kennedy, the longtime &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc" rel&gt;vaccination critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; whose egregious lies about the COVID shot include grossly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/05/rfk-jr-misleads-about-safety-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-children/" rel&gt;exaggerating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the prevalence of side effects and claiming it offers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-rfk-jr-s-covid-19-deceptions/" rel&gt;no protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against severe disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM" class="captioned-button-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Zip this newsletter into somebody’s inbox or zap it onto social media:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy didn’t trot out any of these lines when canceling the Moderna contract. In fact, he didn’t say anything at all. But an HHS spokesperson told reporters like me that the Moderna decision was “about safety, integrity, and trust” and described mRNA technology as “under-tested”—even though the mRNA COVID shots went through extensive, randomized clinical trials before approval, and have been closely monitored for adverse effects ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That last part is no small thing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" rel&gt;Ashish Jha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me in a phone interview he estimates as many as 1 billion people have gotten at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine, with only rare reports of serious side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that this has been extraordinarily well studied,” Jha said, “and turns out to be one of the safest vaccine platforms we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jha, who served as the government’s COVID-19 coordinator during the Biden administration, went on to call the under-testing argument “absurd.” That’s pretty much the consensus among mainstream scientists, as I heard when I put the question to several more of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/83/adam-lauring" rel&gt;Adam Lauring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan and a leading researcher into the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lauringlab.wordpress.com/" rel&gt;biology and evolution of viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said “these vaccines have probably been studied more intensively over the last five years than pretty much any other vaccines.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adamratnermd.com/" rel&gt;Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a nationally recognized pediatric infectious diseases physician in New York City, told me via email that the “mRNA COVID vaccines have been extensively tested and have an excellent safety record.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ratner, who is the author of the book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" rel&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said he could not fathom why Kennedy would be cutting off development of a treatment that might offer the surest, quickest way to prevent a potentially catastrophic spread of bird flu—let alone slow progress on a treatment that holds out the promise of fighting a lot more than infectious disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This decision,” Ratner said, “represents an unforced error of potentially epic proportions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATION OF THE MODERNA CONTRACT was not the only vaccine-related news that Kennedy made last week. He also announced a major shift in the official recommendation about who should get COVID booster shots and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Moderna announcement, however, that decision may have been as remarkable for the way it was made and publicized as for what it actually dictated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The announcement came on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" rel&gt;Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when Kennedy said in a 60-second social media video that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would stop recommending boosters for healthy children and healthy non-elderly adults, including pregnant women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision had been rumored for weeks, and even many of those who would prefer to keep the old recommendation for kids concede the risk-versus-reward calculation is open to debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; But the case for pregnant women getting boosters is a lot more clear-cut, as my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bulwark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; colleague &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jrs-war-on-vaccines-is-here-covid-health-trump-maha" rel&gt;Andrew Egger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; noted last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." rel&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; COVID during pregnancy to pre-term births, preeclampsia, and other complications, as well as long-term damage to the mother’s kidneys, heart, and other systems. Vaccinating pregnant mothers is the surest way to protect newborns and infants, who are highly vulnerable to infection and its most serious effects—and who, for the first few months of life, rely on whatever antibodies they got in utero because they cannot get the shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy’s announcement prompted a blistering &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" rel&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, plus lots of questions about exactly who made the decision and why—especially because two top FDA officials had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" rel&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a much-ballyhooed article a week earlier that their agency still thought pregnancy was a valid reason for boosters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you look at the data and the science, it does show that COVID vaccination is important for pregnant women—we should be doing everything that we can to not only prevent COVID, but mitigating the severity of disease for people who still get it,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/krutikakuppalli.bsky.social" rel&gt;Krutika Kuppalli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a U.S.-based infectious-disease physician and researcher who worked on COVID response for the World Health Organization, told me in a phone interview. “I’m not really understanding how this decision came about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, CDC issues vaccine guidelines by following a clear, methodical process that starts with government scientists at CDC and other agencies collecting and analyzing data, which then goes to an advisory committee of outside scientists who meet and discuss the evidence in public. The CDC director presides over those meetings and makes a recommendation, which in turn requires a (usually perfunctory) signoff from the HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That clearly didn’t happen here, because the advisory committee hasn’t met yet. Even if it had, there would have been no permanent or acting CDC director to preside or follow up with a recommendation. As best as anybody can tell—and, yes, it’s totally bonkers that this is even an open question—the person currently performing the CDC director’s duties is the chief of staff, who among other things is not a scientist. He’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/cos.html" rel&gt;a lawyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with a background in aviation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That might explain why, as the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr-covid/" rel&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, CDC staff learned about the decision the same way the public did: by watching that Tuesday video, in which Kennedy was, bizarrely, flanked by directors of two other health agencies but nobody from the CDC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT CAME NEXT was even weirder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two days went by with no more official communication, except for a “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25955651-memo-on-covid-vaccines/" rel&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” with Kennedy’s signature that circulated internally and eventually landed in the inboxes of reporters like me. It was just one page without HHS letterhead or other trappings of official documentation, and it contained what looked to me like a typo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that seemed to contradict Kennedy’s central message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDC finally updated its online vaccine information on Thursday night, though the new material didn’t line up with what Kennedy had outlined in the video. Under the new guidelines, CDC has completely withdrawn the recommendation of COVID vaccine boosters for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf" rel&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but it has given some support for boosters among &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" rel&gt;healthy kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, albeit with a caveat suggesting parents consult their doctors through “shared decision-making.” CDC has done so even though the case for giving boosters to healthy kids is weaker than it is for giving boosters to pregnant women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And just to make things even more confusing, the HHS media office has responded to media queries (again, including mine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) by saying “the old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule.” That makes it sound like CDC is treating the two groups the same way, when the online guidance for them is plainly different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ambiguous, conflicting messages and shambolic, unprofessional presentations will not surprise you if you have been watching the Trump administration closely these past few months—or if you read last week’s exposé by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors" rel&gt;two NOTUS reporters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; showing Kennedy’s highly touted “Make America Healthy Again” report contained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfks-health-report-is-a-mess" rel&gt;bogus and sometimes misleading citations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the saga around the boosters provides something new: the clearest evidence yet that Kennedy was lying when he promised congressional overseers—and the American people—that his goals were to increase transparency and scientific accountability rather than impose his own agenda. “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me,” he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jUcDvNfYQDU?si=7fb1zbKAumAgpgUp&amp;amp;t=3927" rel&gt;told a House committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What you have here is the secretary—not even the CDC director, because there is no CDC director—the secretary jumping in and saying the way he interprets the science is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and so he’s going to make a decision unilaterally to preempt any decision or recommendation that [the advisory committee] would make,” University of Michigan law professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/samuel-r-bagenstos" rel&gt;Sam Bagenstos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—who served as HHS general counsel during the Biden administration—told me. “That’s a completely irregular process.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full effect of the revised COVID booster guidance is impossible to know at this point—in part because its meaning still isn’t totally clear. But there’s a real possibility that it will affect people’s access to the vaccines, making it difficult for people who want or need them to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “shared decision” recommendation for kids would be enough to keep boosters on the list of vaccines insurers must cover, under the Affordable Care Act’s preventative care requirement, experts told me. But it could at the very least complicate the process for people who would get shots at pharmacies, where consultations aren’t always easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the lack of guidance on pregnant women, that could give insurers more freedom to drop full coverage. On the other hand, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/health/cdc-covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women.html" rel&gt;other CDC webpages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; continued to recommend the shot for pregnant women as late as Friday night. And some insurers might opt to keep covering the boosters regardless of the recommendation—especially for pregnant women, given the high cost of treating serious COVID complications should they occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CDC recommendations have implications that go beyond legal requirements for insurers. They influence public attitudes. CDC recommendations also serve as guidance for physicians all over the country, many of whom don’t have time—or specific technical background—to spend days weighing research evidence on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a primary-care physician and you’re trying to decide what to recommend to your patient, it gets to the point where you can’t necessarily trust the recommendations that are being made by HHS and CDC anymore,” Bagenstos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even for experts following the research more closely, Jha said, “the usual process has a few advantages, because it’s super transparent. Everybody has seen the data. You can disagree with the decisions, but at least you’ve seen the data on which it is based, and the CDC scientists have had a chance to share that data in a public function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, Kennedy is introducing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamkeiper.com/post/3lqgdrvofas2a" rel&gt;more uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; into everyday medicine while undercutting CDC’s institutional credibility. And he’s doing so in a way that could render this particular decision vulnerable to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html" rel&gt;court challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Bagenstos noted, because administrative law prohibits federal agencies like CDC from arbitrary or capricious action. That’s one reason officials deliberate so methodically and so publicly—or did in non-Trumpian times, at any rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But litigation takes time. And even if Kennedy’s guidance on COVID boosters eventually falls in court, he’s sent a message about how unreliable federal support for vaccines has become and will be. The companies that manufacture vaccines are sure to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They have other ways to make money, after all, and other places to do it too. That includes China, whose government has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/us-china-biotech-report-commission/744718/" rel&gt;investing heavily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html" rel&gt;biotech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at precisely the time when—thanks again to Trump and Kennedy—the U.S. government is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cut-18-billion-nih-grants-rcna205568" rel&gt;cutting back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/us-science-cuts.html" rel&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for medical research. Put it all together, and it’s easy to see how vaccine development and production could slow or move overseas, or maybe both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any of those scenarios, Americans could find themselves waiting longer for help in a future pandemic. And if it’s bird flu or a new COVID strain or some other yet-to-be-seen pathogen, waiting longer for a vaccine could mean not surviving the outbreak at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share The Bulwark","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share The Bulwark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 12:48:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQVzNIVGhXanIwYmxkYnJ1MW1Rak0yWkR4c1BWOTF4N2NLOGlreWV0QjRFaExfUURaN0VFb21qU2s3TGlydFRDdjBPQVhZVkZrUmRXc0xDd2wtazNCWlZ4OTQ2WU1NODd4VjgxNmI4Sl9UdW5lRUVjQXNCTUhQUVlQMnBQY0xoQ04ybVZUbzdJdUVIVHkwb1VQcjJfT3pmbktpbXJVeHg0cEVvUUJ1SmU1NG5CWnZTcjR5R1ZGNGx0ZHc4d1BtNlYwOFBObVJ2Zw</guid></item><item><title>发现生活在健康大脑中的T细胞-神经科学新闻 | T Cells Found Living in Healthy Brains - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1LZFdLT2ptOFNFYm5RZ3VPQ3gwNWpmMFB3YnpDTEJDTnZhdTllMzdaVW1KZ3dpQ3M5QmxJYjdnTC1hcHR0SWVmMnlFN0E4WnVmNnIyYXNwOGxHdGpqWDl1c3dZMW5Taml6c0NIdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Contrary to long-standing beliefs, T cells—key immune cells—have been discovered in the healthy brains of both mice and humans. These cells, previously thought to only enter the brain during disease, were most concentrated in a region that regulates hunger and thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that T cells travel from the gut to the brain, potentially delivering real-time updates about the body’s status. This groundbreaking discovery reveals a new dimension of the gut-brain axis, where immune cells may serve as messengers shaping behavior and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Presence:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells inhabit healthy brains, particularly in the subfornical organ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Brain Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells originate in the gut and are influenced by the gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing brain T cells alters food-seeking behavior in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brain is a unique place. It is shielded from much of the body by the blood-brain barrier, meaning it’s protected from pathogens and potentially dangerous substances that might be in our blood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And historically, many scientists believed that separation extended to the immune system as well: The brain has its own specialized immune cells called microglia, but immune cells present in the rest of the body were long thought to steer clear of the brain unless there was a disease or other problem requiring their presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of scientists from Yale School of Medicine (YSM) has shown that immune cells known as T cells reside in the healthy brains of mice and humans, trafficked there from the gut and fat. This is the first time T cells have been shown to inhabit the brain under normal, non-diseased conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published May 28 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of T cells in the healthy brain and evidence that they travel between the brain and other parts of the body upend the field’s dogma about the role of T cells in the brain, the study authors say. Pathologists have seen T cells in the brain before, but it was assumed they were there responding to current or previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of T cells as something that fights off infection and causes autoimmune disease, but the surprise of this study is that T cells have a different role in biology that we were unaware of,” says David Hafler, MD, William S. and Lois Stiles Edgerly Professor of Neurology at YSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this paper, we’ve definitively shown that their presence is not just disease-related but part of normal physiology, and that changes everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found T cells most densely concentrated in a small region called the subfornical organ, which is nestled deep inside the brain and is known to regulate thirst and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found the cells in the subfornical organs of laboratory mice and of people who had died and donated their brains to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the brain also has a slightly leaky blood-brain-barrier, which researchers believe allows cells in this brain region to more readily receive signals from the blood to know when its host animal needs to drink or eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This makes it all the more interesting that immune cells are also there, presumably to provide some kind of signal about the body’s normal state,” says Tomomi Yoshida, a YSM doctoral student and first author of the study. Yoshida led the work along with Andrew Wang, MD, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine and immunobiology, and Hafler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Relaying signals from the gut to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cells perform many different functions, and researchers often categorize this broad class of immune cells into finer subclasses based on the kinds of proteins they display on their surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the brain’s T cells through this lens, the YSM researchers found that they were different from the T cells present in the membrane that surrounds the brain and were most similar to those that reside in the gut and fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, altering the gut microbiome affected the transport of these T cells to the brain. The researchers found that when baby mice weaned and started on solid food, the corresponding shift in their gut microbiomes kicked off T cells’ travel from gut to brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice reared in a germ-free environment, with no gut microbiomes, didn’t have T cells in their brains. And depleting the animals of the brain T cells changed their food-seeking behavior when the mice were offered food following a short fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that the immune cells may be signaling the status of the body to the brain through a previously undiscovered form of gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highway of information between the digestive system and the brain, also called the gut-brain axis, plays many important roles in our health and well-being, but previous studies had not uncovered a direct route for immune cells to enter the brain from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other means of gut-brain communication include the vagus nerve, which directly connects the brain to the intestines, and small molecules secreted into the blood. Relying on the diffusion of molecules in the blood struck Wang as an inefficient method of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a design principle, it seems kind of a risky way to send information,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How cool would it be if you actually reprogrammed an immune cell to represent the state of the gut and you then send that cell to the brain, where it can tell the brain what it saw and allow the brain to adapt based on that information?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what Wang and his colleagues think is happening. The T cells could be telling the brain about the body’s nutrition status, but they could also be conveying other important signals such as the state of the gut microbiome, the researchers hypothesize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang believes they might be stopping in fat tissue on their way from the gut to the brain as a sort of quality-control checkpoint, but that remains to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists next want to look at how the T cells know to move from the gut to the brain as well as what happens to these cells in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises more questions than it answers,” says Yoshida. “But they’re all interesting questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research reported in this news article was supported by the National Institutes of Health (awards R01AI162645, R01AR080104, P01AI073748, R01AI22220, UM1HG009390, P01AI039671, P50CA121974, R01CA227473, 1F31NS130957-01A1, DP1DA050986, and R37AR40072) and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was also supported by the Smith Family Foundation, the Colton Center for Autoimmunity at Yale, the Food and Allergy Science Initiative, the PEW Charitable Trusts, the Mathers Family Foundation, the Ludwig Family Foundation, the Knights of Columbus, Race to Erase MS, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the National MS Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Tompa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Tompa – Yale&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09050-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/a&gt;” by David Hafler et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the organization estimates that more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with it and nearly 53,000 will die from it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd0z2xq00003b6mygdumboq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New studies presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in the last few days offer promising findings for both pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions, including the impact of diet and exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00053b6mkmbsux8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diagnoses of colorectal cancer have been decreasing overall for decades, the American Cancer Society says, thanks in large part to better screening. But case rates are rising among younger adults, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/health/colorectal-cancer-young-age-mystery"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimates that colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of cancer death among adults ages 20 to 49 by 2030.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00073b6mwjgkf0zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier research has suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/colon-cancer-exercise-wellness"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; can improve survival rates for colorectal cancer patients, and a new study – published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday – confirmed those findings with robust clinical trial data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00083b6mj83awgmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between 2009 and 2024, researchers followed nearly 900 colon cancer patients who had completed chemotherapy – half of whom received an informational booklet that encouraged them to adopt a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and exercise the other half of whom were also matched with a physical activity consultant for three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00093b6mkyy9gqe5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that there was a 28% reduction in the risk of recurrence or new cancer for patients on the exercise program, with a five-year disease-free survival rate of 80% for the group with an exercise consultant compared with 74% for the group who just received the booklet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000a3b6mf89d2s1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, the exercise program was found to prevent 1 out of every 16 patients from developing recurrent or new cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000b3b6m9m2cz2c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That magnitude is comparable to – and in many cases exceeds – the magnitude of benefit offered by a lot of our very good standard cancer drugs,” said Dr. Christopher Booth, a professor of oncology with Queen’s University and co-author of the new study. “Exercise really should be considered an essential component of treatment of colon cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000c3b6mr1f8bh4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Work is still being done to understand why exercise can help reduce the risk of cancer, but experts say that it may have something to do with the ways exercise helps reduce inflammation in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000d3b6mqesnc4n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244419" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday found that anti-inflammatory diets also helped improve survival rates for people with stage 3 colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000e3b6mvb9cpfp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients who consumed more anti-inflammatory diets – including coffee, tea and vegetables such as leafy greens – and engaged in higher levels of physical activity had a 63% lower risk of death compared to patients who consumed the most inflammatory diets – including things like red meat, processed meat, refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages – and engaged in lower levels of physical activity, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000f3b6ml3iz34ip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Actively, as a field, we’re learning about the role of the immune system in cancer development, and inflammation is an immune response,” said Dr. Sara Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the study, and the rise of colorectal cancer cases in younger people suggests it’s a critical piece of the puzzle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000g3b6md2k4f34q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals … that really suggests to us that there is something in the environment – either in the foods we eat, our lifestyles, the chemicals that could be in our foods, all sorts of different things – that are outside of just genetics alone that could be driving these rates,” she said. “So it is incredibly important for us, as a field, to be thinking about how our diet and lifestyle impacts not just our risk of developing this cancer, but then how people fare after it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000h3b6mi7bfcoz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Booth and Char said that colorectal cancer patients are often seeking ways to proactively manage their risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000i3b6ma0mugc7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s it’s very empowering for patients,” Booth said. “It’s also achievable for patients. This is a commitment, but it’s something that patients can achieve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000j3b6mok7uwtp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his study, an “exercise prescription” was developed based on each individual’s starting point. Most people were able to reach their target increase if they went for a brisk walk for about an hour three or four days per week, Booth said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000k3b6mw5g7xq1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle interventions like exercise and diet are also “sustainable for health systems,” he said, but it’s key that the system helps support patients in accessing the resources needed for behavioral interventions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd1163l00023b6m4hor6zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new study showed promising results that might represent a new standard-of-care for certain patients with advanced colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000l3b6mq6pzopzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, drugmaker Pfizer presented &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on a colorectal cancer drug, Braftovi,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;used in combination with a standard chemotherapy and an antibody drug. During the trial, the drug combo was shown to double the length of time patients with an aggressive form of colorectal cancer lived with treatment: an average of 30 months compared with 15 months using currently available treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000m3b6myxj3ye32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Braftovi targets a mutation in a specific protein that can lead to abnormal cell growth, and it’s already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat some forms of cancer. The study, which was funded by Pfizer, published Friday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000n3b6m0s8hajvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a targeted cancer therapy that really depends on knowing what’s driving patients’ cancer,” Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla told CNN. These targeted therapies are one of the biggest advancements in cancer treatment over the past two decades, he said, and it’s easy to diagnose whether cancer patients have the specific mutation that Braftovi can treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000o3b6map65qocy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest data on treatment for colorectal cancer a “very, very important finding,” Bourla said, and the drugmaker plans to seek additional approval to add the new indication to the drug’s label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

measles outbreak has revealed how her son's infection left her fearing he could suffer permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex, from Lubbock, near Gaines County,&lt;span&gt; revealed her baby erupted in the hallmark red and splotchy measles rash and developed a dangerously high fever after he was exposed at daycare to the virus — the most infectious in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At eight months old, he was too young to have received the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14713031/rfk-jr-moment-congress-hearing-erupts-vaccines-testimony.html"&gt;measles vaccine &lt;/a&gt;— which is normally administered for the first time at 12 months old — but there is a high proportion of unvaccinated people in the area, which is experiencing a record-high case count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, the US officially reported 1,000 measles cases in 2025 — marking only the second time case counts have crossed this threshold since the disease was &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6801577/Measles-cases-soar-nearly-eclipsing-2018s-total.html"&gt;declared eradicated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And officials are warning if the disease continues to spread unabated, the US could lose its measles elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex said her son was exposed to measles on April 3, after another parent sent their child to daycare despite having another child at home who was infected with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'If you're not going to vaccinate, at the very least, don't send your sick kids to daycare. My baby now has measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alex said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over the dangers of the measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was alerted to the infection by the daycare, and immediately isolated her baby — thinking for the first few days that they were in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on April 10, the little boy developed a mild fever, became sluggish and had congestion and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she took him to see a doctor on April 13, she was told they could see small, white spots on the inside of his cheeks — a sign of a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day an angry, red rash erupted, which spread down from his hairline to his face before eventually overtaking his whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worried mother-of-two posted videos of her son's rash online, where her baby appeared tearful, listless and completely covered in the rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex was extremely concerned her son's infection could turn fatal or leave him with lasting side effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hereforworkoutvideos"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: 'Apart from brain swelling, I’m mostly concerned about secondary &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-5429fc70-3caa-11f0-a211-0308852b4ca6" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles can cause brain inflammation, also known as encephalitis. It is a serious side effect of the virus and can cause permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports it occurs in about one in 1,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, pneumonia can lead to septic shock, respiratory failure and even kidney and lung damage.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is particularly dangerous to young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 unvaccinated children who are infected develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 suffer from encephalitis — swelling of the brain that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to three in every 1,000 unvaccinated children who are infected die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people commenting on Alex's videos were quick to say the disease did not appear to be a mild illness, with some even saying it motivated them to get their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'My mother told me measles wasn't that bad when I told her I won't travel with my baby because of the outbreak. I sent her this and she changed her mind. My heart hurts for your baby.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second said: 'I'm so sorry your little angel is going through this. My son got his six months shots today, and I elected to get the MMR early because of your video.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is in the grips of America's &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7075977/US-measles-outbreak-worst-1994-900-infected-26-states-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;biggest measles outbreak in two decades&lt;/a&gt; — mostly among young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two young and unvaccinated girls, ages six and eight, have died as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two days of the rash, Alex posted it was beginning to calm down — saying she felt they were now over the worst of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her son was not hospitalized for the disease, but was treated at home to help reduce the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video, she detailed what she gave to her son to help with the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She gave him Tylenol and Motrin for the fever and budesonide, a prescription drug used to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also received antibiotics to head-off any secondary infections, because measles weakens the immune system — raising the risk of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother only let her baby sleep lying down on her chest throughout the illness, and kept using cool baths and washcloths to try to lower his temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave him the probiotic Ther-Biotic Baby for his gut, and cod liver oil - an unproven remedy touted by Robert F Kennedy Jr - to boost his levels of Vitamin A and D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her baby had mostly recovered by April 17, with his rash having disappeared. Alex showed him crawling and smiling again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over measles, with doctors being quick to comment saying this was the first modern case recorded publicly that they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex has another child who has been vaccinated against measles, and she said she was not pro- or anti-vaccine, but felt it was important for everyone to work together to stop the disease from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:26:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQktJTDB2QWNNZzczOVRmR3JzOTNZd0tHZ1VGd1h3RWx3WXhjSVFLNUhMT0ZtZEZ2NklvWnN1WjN6ODVKWXI0NWxtWVpFSVRFRmJfSXdPY2VwQnh2ZjVvN1R1TER0TUlaZmJPalU1cl9lSlVESjRTRTdBcVlDUC1admpDZFE4ZzlXb3A0RFVwWlBCb2FVS3VDOUcyZVBTREFMMXpadG54VmFTYnF00gGyAUFVX3lxTE80QzdhWW56eWtPT05sLW5GSmpIMGJzaEFRSHk3dVc4TGpKNEFpRFNBTDU3Zk5DbERXdHQxZEd0blFHSElmdFotVjFIcmlFVTRoYWJwZW5ieFhNMklOQVhYYkV0N05sM3d0VUdqQm0yNlVCTnBqaVoyb0l4N0g0dTAwQnladGdoYlFVTUdYMlZ0S2VqdzYweXVYWHdPRVBWS0RNOGp3QWZKRGZ3RHNKLXg5N3c</guid></item><item><title>祖父被诊断为四期肺癌，免疫治疗后无疾病-好消息网 | Grandfather Diagnosed With Stage Four Lung Cancer Becomes Free of Disease After Immunotherapy - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxQTVRXWktzdllVZ1BrSTExeldhekpPbFlwOWRIcG02bzR4clozTnJYSEFEb093YzVwZExhVnFUanBJemc3OXcwQWRSblo2Mk5NcVEwVjFQQjllU2ZaTi1fMmZoMXl1UnowR3BzVlNaclVBdlJZNWl1UUhzeXZBMUJnQUgtRFZUSW5FbnFTZUdDal9YYnh6bktLWmp4RUswQTZnQlIxNmIzdjFLZjlNY1pfQmE2dmZQV3pwTzk2NEFhMWJlcHdS?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grandad diagnosed with advanced lung cancer which often leaves patients dead within four months has become free of the disease after being treated with a new immunotherapy drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Cook was told he had stage four cancer in 2019 after seeking treatment for a sore on his chest that wasn’t getting any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 50% of people who are diagnosed with stage four cancer die within four months of their diagnosis and only 5% of patients will still be alive five years later, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old was advised to get radiation therapy to target the tumor directly—but was also told he could try a new treatment called pembrolizumab (sold under the brand name Keytruda).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type of immunotherapy, pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the PD-1 receptor on the surface of our T cells, which then enables the immune system to find and kill the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was previously deemed too expensive as it would cost around £84,000 per patient ($113k), but an agreement was reached with the manufacturer by the British National Health Service (the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK) to reduce the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving the treatment for around two years, Jeff was told that he is officially cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering I had such an advanced cancer, and the survival statistics were not in my favor, I feel like the pembrolizumab has been a medical miracle,” said the grandfather-of-two. “I’m able to live life to the full as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff, who has two sons, gave up smoking more than 20 years ago, but towards the end of 2018, he realized that he had a sore on the left side of his chest which wasn’t getting better—despite being prescribed antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEARS CAN RECOVER TOO!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bear-shocks-vets-by-going-into-remission-from-terminal-cancer-after-taking-meds-in-honey-a-rare-treat-that-delights-her/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was referred to a chest specialist at Leighton Hospital in Cheshire, where he later received the terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Woolf then suggested that Jeff could try the pembrolizumab treatment, which was fairly new at the time—and comes with various possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pembrolizumab was kind to my body, and I had no noticeable side effects from the treatment,” Jeff said in an article from SWNS news agency. “After three or four treatments, I was leading a normal life again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff is now taking vacations with his wife of over 50 years and is active in sports again at his local cricket club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m incredibly grateful to Dr. Woolf and all the NHS staff who have helped me during my treatment—and to the scientists and researchers who helped to develop such a wonderful life-saving drug.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Woolf says he’s “delighted” that Jeff has had such a positive response to the treatment and is now cancer-free six years after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stage four lung cancer remains very serious with average survival figures of less than a year. However, new treatments such as immunotherapy are a game changer for some of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still need to do better at diagnosing patients earlier though, and continuing to develop new and better treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

Like, maybe you tell yourself you can only eat brown rice and can never make exceptions for white rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up becoming less about healthy eating, which is usually what it starts out as, and more about an unhealthy obsession with food purity or ‘clean eating,’ or ‘proper eating,’” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It messes with your social life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it crosses the line is when it starts to interfere with your activities of daily living,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stress about food interferes with your social engagements, like you turn down plans because you aren’t sure of the food situation, it could be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it impacts your ability to live socially in the world, comfortably, then it’s a problem that you should address,” Auguste added.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up being less about the average person concerned about healthy food, and more just really obsessing about it where it’s almost your personality,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: skynesher via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;skynesher via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Orthorexia, or a preoccupation with healthy eating, is becoming more common in society.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spend lots of time analyzing ingredient lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to check the ingredient lists and nutrition labels on food from time to time, especially if you have an allergy or a specific nutrition goal you’re trying to hit. But, for someone with orthorexia, they may find that they’re “compulsively, all the time, analyzing all the ingredients,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may turn into hours and hours spent meal planning or researching the nutrition of every ingredient that’s going into your food, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you break your food rules, you feel anxious or guilty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the line comes when you start to feel like you’re thinking about [healthy eating] all the time,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like you &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/anxiety" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="have anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683887bfe4b06202aa9171cc" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/anxiety" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;have anxiety&lt;/a&gt; ... you’re nervous about eating something ... and you feel like that more often than not, then that could be a sign that maybe you’re thinking about it too much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for if you feel guilty after breaking any of your food rules, Heise added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste added that if your thoughts about food are disrupting your mental health at all, you should consider talking to someone. Auguste also said if it interferes with your physical health, it’s absolutely a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if this sounds like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from either a dietitian or mental health professional, you can determine whether your healthy eating is simply that — or something more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to talk to somebody like a dietitian who specializes in disordered eating, a therapist who specializes in it, who can help you figure out [if this is a problem for you],” Auguste said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians generally take insurance, noted Auguste, and they can help you make sure you’re on the right track with your eating, whether or not you have specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can definitely recover from orthorexia if you have the right support,” said Heise, “so, as soon as you feel those feelings, address it as early as possible so that it doesn’t turn into something that rules your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating is a lifelong process and isn’t meant to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you eat, your nutrition needs likely differ from your partner’s, your neighbor’s and your favorite social media influencer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t put too much stock in social media nutrition trends or what diet a friend is raving about, Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over the latest food trend, focus on realistic goals — “so, not focusing on whether or not a food is clean, but focusing on whether or not you have variety in your meals,” Heise said. “Are you getting a variety of different foods? Are you getting a variety of different nutrients? Because that’s where true nutrition comes in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste said it’s important to let go of all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to eating, which includes rules around following one specific diet or a rigid plan to lose weight. “I have so many patients that do that, and then it’s not sustainable to be 100% all of the time,” Auguste added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when they fall off of the diet, they feel like a failure and give up, she noted. “I feel like that is a downside for somebody with orthorexia, is that you are afraid of letting go of the 100%, and you’re afraid that if you let go, that you fall back into that nothing,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the middle ground and remind yourself that you don’t have to be perfect, added Auguste. “You can say to yourself, ‘I usually eat healthy.’ You don’t have to say, ‘I always eat healthy,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use “always” language, you “introduce that concept of failure and judging yourself,” Auguste noted. And it’s perfectly OK, and not a failure, to have that salty snack or sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more practice you can get of letting yourself find the middle, where you’re not ‘always,’ you’re just ‘usually’ doing something, I think the better,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on all of this, have compassion for yourself.

Walking 2,337 or more steps each day lowered the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, which includes both heart disease and stroke. Researchers also discovered that walking 1,000 more steps each day saw a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality and that increasing walks by 500 steps each day brought a 7% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is a welcome piece of news as most people struggle to hit that 10,000-step goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The problem has been that the recommended 10,000 steps per day and the definition of physical inactivity of less than 5,000 steps per day has been really difficult for most patients to achieve ... it almost leads to a sense of fatalism that many members of the public feel that they can’t reach these recommendations,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/medicine-cardiology-clinical-tips-advisory-committee-tips-mentor/faculty/keith-c" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Keith Ferdinand" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/medicine-cardiology-clinical-tips-advisory-committee-tips-mentor/faculty/keith-c" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Keith Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of preventative cardiology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research “does not mean that the 10,000 steps per day recommendation is wrong, it just gives the public some confidence that moderate activity is better than none,” said Ferdinand, who was not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the more you walk, the better your well-being. The research found that people who walked more steps had the lowest risk of premature mortality. Specifically, those who walked 20,000 steps or more each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you can’t achieve 10,000 steps per day, don’t despair. Some activity is better than none. But then, on the other hand, if you can safely achieve those 10,000 steps per day, you may even have greater benefit in terms of mortality,” Ferdinand added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: boonchai wedmakawand via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;boonchai wedmakawand via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“This does not mean that the 10,000 steps per day recommendation is wrong, it just gives the public some confidence that moderate activity is better than none," said Dr. Keith Ferdinand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How To Get Your Steps In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association suggests 150 minutes of moderate activity, and it’s not just getting those 10,000 steps. It could be things that we often don’t think of as exercise,” Ferdinand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This includes moderate housekeeping, gardening, walking with your kids and walking your dog, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a purposeful going to a gym or purposeful walking program, but being physically active for that 150 minutes ... appears to be healthy,” Ferdinand explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do want to go for a walk, he said consider going with a buddy for safety’s sake and be sure to be mindful of the weather — it has been a hot summer throughout much of the country, which can be dangerous for walkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try talking a walk inside of a shopping mall or around an unused basketball court at you local community center, he said. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/indoor-walking-tips-fall-winter_l_6346dd84e4b08e0e607f1505" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="You can also consider " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6346dd84e4b08e0e607f1505" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;You can also consider &lt;/a&gt;walking up and down the stairs in your house, creating a loop to walk inside your home or visiting a grocery store for a stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferdinand said that after reading the study, his focus is on motivating people 60 and older to get out for a walk since one of the steepest benefits was seen when study participants got in 6,000 to 10,000 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you decide to do, it’s clear that movement of any sort is valuable. “M&lt;span&gt;ore is better, but some is better than none,” Ferdinand noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a lower-than-expected daily step count resulted in a benefit in terms of cardiovascular health and overall mortality risks, this does not mean you should cut yourself off once you hit that lower number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure the lay public who gets this information from this meta-analysis doesn’t get the unintended consequence of ‘Well, I can just do 2,000 steps or 4,000 steps and call it a day.’ If you can do more safely and in an environment which has some degree of comfort, then that is even better,” Ferdinand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for the best walking shoes?

It comes in men's sizes 4-17 and in multiple colors, including black, orange, black/purple, gray/mint and white. It has a sock-like fit and a "boosting" feature, a super responsive midsole that makes it easier to take steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Extraordinarily comfortable shoe. I have flat feet, getting older with hip creaks here and there. My legs and joints feel great when wearing these shoes.

Any no-tie, slip-on or Velcro design that allows easy on and easy off is also great for seniors who have a hard time bending over," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjustable strap closure allows you to get a more customized fit. The design also has a protective toe box that can help prevent pain from toe stubbing. It comes in white and pink and in women's sizes 4-12 with wide and extra-wide options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have problems with width in shoes. This fits better than expected. Comfortable in toe box and I even have a skip in my step thanks to the heel shock absorbing the bounce. Easy to put on with the velcro strap as the sole support to hold the shoe in place. Do not skip owning these shoes!" — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14FMKI0NVJFGV?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D68388803e4b06202aa917265%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" data-a-size="small" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="snoopymaven" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14FMKI0NVJFGV?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D68388803e4b06202aa917265%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="34"&gt;snoopymaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Vionic"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;Vionic Walker classic shoe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamped with the American Podiatric Medical Association Seal of Acceptance, this Vionic shoe is another recommendation from Perkins. It's breathable, has a podiatrist-designed footbed, cushioned outsole and a rubber outsole built for steady traction. It comes in several color options and is available in women's sizes 5-12 and men's sizes 7-14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I received Vionic sneakers for Christmas.

It comes in multiple colors and in women's sizes 5-12 and men's sizes 7-15, both with wide options available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bought these shoes for my mom.

								&lt;p&gt;For years, we've known that not all bacteria are enemies — some are actually good for us, and belong inside us. That understanding sparked a boom in probiotics science and a multibillion dollar probiotics industry. But viruses? They still get a bad rap, despite quietly occupying our insides —and sometimes even helping us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that scientists even agree on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/12/26/are-alive-why-a-seemingly-simple-biology-question-prompts-heated-debate-among-scientists/" target="_blank"&gt;whether viruses are alive or not&lt;/a&gt;. There's so much we don't know, including just what they are doing in our bodies. What we do know, though, is that viruses are not, in fact, all out to get us. Not only are they not uniformly &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; news for our health, but many viruses actually live with us in a symbiotic and evolutionary relationship. Viruses exist in healthy people, and some are even actively beneficial for human health. Not to mention that about 8% of our very own genome consists of &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02039/full" target="_blank"&gt;ancient viral genes&lt;/a&gt;. So basically, viruses are in us, and &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; us. Although we have known a lot about a small number of heavily-studied "bad" viruses for decades, the vast diversity of these weird little guys that co-exist in humans is mostly unmapped, just waiting to be discovered and understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite clear that humans are exposed to all kinds of viruses throughout our lives. And I think we’re only starting to figure out why they’re there, what they’re doing, and what impact they have on our health,” Ken Cadwell, associate director at the University of Pennsylvania Perrelman School of Medicine’s Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases and director of its Gnotobiotic and Naturalized Mouse Core Facility, told Salon in a video interview.  Cadwell studies how the human (and mouse, his usual model organism) immune system has adapted to the various microbes we encounter through our lifetimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Cadwell and two colleagues made the amazing discovery of a virus – specifically, a norovirus, that pathogen notorious for sweeping nursing homes and daycares, causing terrible upset at both ends – that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25409145/"&gt;can actually restore the healthy condition of the intestines&lt;/a&gt;, just as “good” bacteria do, for example if you take a probiotic supplement to restore your microbiome after wiping it out with bacteria-killing antibiotics. That bit of good news about a virus you’d normally not want to touch with a sterilized ten-foot pole was an early finding in Cadwell's quest to understand what turns out to be a huge diversity of viruses living in, with, and on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;I think we’re only starting to figure out why they’re there, what they’re doing, and what impact they have on our health.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's time for viruses to take their turn in the limelight. The NIH's Human Virome Program aims to fill the great gap in our knowledge about viruses that "call us home". The main focus is on beneficial viruses that are persistent in the human body, not on those that cause disease (noroviruses, like Cadwell studied, wouldn't be part of this, &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome/general-faq" target="_blank"&gt;the Program FAQ says&lt;/a&gt;, because they are transient). Among 16 institutions that received funding through this program is VAST (Viromes Across Space and Time), a major longitudinal Weill Cornell Medicine/Stanford project &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/04/a-vast-new-view-of-viruses" target="_blank"&gt;to learn what a healthy human virome looks like&lt;/a&gt;. This project, among others underway, ought to tell us more than most of us have ever wanted to know about those weird little things. But it's knowledge that could improve our health, even save our lives one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The undiscovered diversity of viruses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, me, and everyone else has, it's thought, about &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00536-5" target="_blank"&gt;as many viral particles living in or on each of us&lt;/a&gt; as there are bits on a computer hard disk in 2024 — ten trillion, or roughly a third of the total amount of cells in our bodies.  The total number of viral particles on the planet, though, is insane: a bit less than the mass of the Sun in kilograms, or 10 followed by 31 zeroes, an incomprehensible number that makes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7148134/#:~:text=I%20review%20the%20history%20of,less%20or%20much%20more%20than" target="_blank"&gt;viruses the most abundant biological stuff on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps 320,000 different types of viruses infect mammals. The statistical &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00598-13" target="_blank"&gt;study that came up with that estimate&lt;/a&gt; based its analysis on the dozens of different viruses from 9 virus families all found in a single Indian Flying Fox, &lt;em&gt;Pteropus giganteus. &lt;/em&gt;And indeed, most emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic — meaning they come to us from another animal — and most of them are viruses. So if this estimate is even remotely accurate, we're looking at hundreds of thousands of potential new viruses as we increasingly mingle with animals via large-scale agriculture and the destruction, fragmentation, and human colonization of animal habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Viruses understandably evoke a bad connotation because we know all the harm associated with viruses," Cadwell said. We have very good reason to surveil infections — H5N1 bird flu, for example — in our mammal and other animal friends &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/04/30/bird-flu-isnt-as-silent-as-we-think--experts-caution-the-is-still-growing/" target="_blank"&gt;in hopes of heading off a disastrous adaptation&lt;/a&gt; enabling human-to-human transmission of a virus that spreads easily and kills or maims many of those it infects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as we've seen, not all viruses are out to get us. It's possible that some of them are only out to get some of us, some of the time. Others are totally benign, just hanging out inside or on-side us without doing any harm. Still others are on our team, taking down bacterial invaders before &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can infect us or otherwise do us dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170222003057" target="_blank"&gt;8% of our genome that is made up of ancient virus DNA&lt;/a&gt; includes both "goodies" and "baddies" (although they are fully part of our genomes, not just living inside us, &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome/faq" target="_blank"&gt;they are considered part of the virome&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of the NIH's Human Virome Program, along with viruses that infect humans and viruses that reside in us but infect bacteria). The 30 distinct families of endogenous retroviruses, as that ancient viral DNA is called, in humans each represents a distinct process of colonization. An ordinary retrovirus became part of our ancestors, while going extinct in the outside world, over thousands to 3 million years of evolution, and most became part of our ancestors' genome sometime before we diverged from chimpanzees. Some are nicknamed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/barbara-mcclintock-and-the-discovery-of-jumping-34083/" target="_blank"&gt;jumping genes&lt;/a&gt; because they literally jump around, copying and pasting themselves into different parts of our genome just as if they were still viral invaders. Some bad things they might do: some evidence suggests they could be responsible for symptoms of motor neuron disease like &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac8201" target="_blank"&gt;ALS in patients with HIV&lt;/a&gt; and others, and perhaps in other neurodegenerative disease (there are various ways this could occur and it's not yet clear exactly what their role might be). Ancient viral genes might also play a role in helping regular viruses get a hold in us, and in the development of some cancers and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there's the good stuff. Our endogenous retroviruses &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457924001692#bib15" target="_blank"&gt;sometimes play important positive roles&lt;/a&gt; for our health: one gene with ancient viral origins, for example, codes for a protein involved in the development of the human placenta, another may protect a developing fetus from its mother's immune response. Others may be important for keeping human stem cells "pluripotent", or able to become any one of many different types of human cell. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1187282/" target="_blank"&gt;And these viral genes may protect us&lt;/a&gt; against other viral infections in some cases, or provide antiviral resistance, immunizing rare individuals against HIV for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the real viruses? Cadwell's 2014 finding about norovirus isn't the only evidence that suggests viruses that infect us aren't always our enemies, either. Anelloviruses, a group of viruses that are found in 90% of healthy humans, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680506/" target="_blank"&gt;might (it's not clear yet) play a role in suppressing tumor formation&lt;/a&gt;. In other cases, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2491" target="_blank"&gt;a virus could protect you from a different pathogen&lt;/a&gt;. Take &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17507983/" target="_blank"&gt;plague, for example&lt;/a&gt;, which I think we can all agree we'd rather avoid. Studies in mice suggest that unnoticed infection with run-of-the-mill viruses like cytomegaloviruses or herpes viruses can protect against infection with the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;, which causes bubonic plague (and, as a bonus maybe, against Listeria bacteria). &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/good-viruses-do" target="_blank"&gt;Different viruses&lt;/a&gt; can cure diabetes in mice; reduce the risk of a really nasty virus, Ebola, proving fatal in humans; or prevent HIV progressing to AIDS. And phage viruses, which are viruses that infect bacteria, rather than humans, can protect us by directly attacking bacterial villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People have made observations in either direction [good or bad for us] with various diseases," Cadwell said. "A more causative role [in preventing or fighting disease] is supported by animal models... we lack a bit of information on what's happening in humans. But it makes sense to me that having viruses around, what we can say with a fair amount of accuracy is because viruses require the host cell to make more copies of itself, there's no way it's silent. It's interacting with us, and there's got to be immune consequences to that. And whether that's good or bad I think is going to be highly dependent on the context and the individual." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying potentially symbiotic or mutually beneficial viruses the way we now avidly study bacteria for their possible helpful effects for human health — and for human bank accounts, in the case of those hawking often under-evidenced and under-regulated microbiome supplements — requires a bit of a mindset shift, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These viruses that infect our cells, they have primarily have been studied from the lens of having bad effects on our health, but there's more and more correlations that are demonstrating that that's not necessarily the outcome," said Cadwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it's an easy sell, nor a quick leap to finding "wellness viruses" on the shelves at Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Probably the low-hanging fruit here are the oncolytic viruses," Cadwell suggested. These are viruses that invade and destroy cancer cells — using their awesome power for good rather than evil, you might say. In fact, he explained, some viruses do this really well. So for over a decade, scientists have been working to understand how they do it, and then to engineer viruses for this therapeutic purpose.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy-by-treatment-types/oncolytic-virus-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA approved the first and only cancer-killing virus&lt;/a&gt;, a herpes virus used for treatment of a kind of late-stage skin cancer, where there are few conventional options. The virus was engineered to be less likely to infect healthy cells, and also, sneakily, to cause the cancer cells it infects to produce a protein that strengthens the immune system to help destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people have been exploring the potential of certain viruses as delivery vehicles for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The kind of holy grail for gene therapy is you've got to put the genetic material you want in the cell you want it to be in. So you need a delivery system...These viruses through evolution have figured out a way to get their genetic material inside a cell... we can swap in and out parts of people's genome, like let's say you're missing a proper copy of hemoglobin, we could put in the correct copy into your cell by putting it into the virus and have your cell infect the virus. That's the promise of gene targeting," Cadwell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other applications include using viruses to deliver bone marrow cells for transplants, production of particular cell types, and more. Technology in the past didn't allow precision and raised the risk of the virus integrating into parts of the genome you don't want it to go to, but it has progressed to the point where you may soon be able to target a specific cell in a person with whatever you want to repair or add, delivered by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers focused on curing the diseases viruses cause, but in future, they may pay equal attention to how viruses, carefully engineered and deployed, could make us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new trend for the wellness industry juggernaut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is it time to add viruses to one's microbiome-feeding regimen of probiotics and prebiotics, synbiotics (which combine the two), digestive enzymes, postbiotics (compounds produced by bacteria) and perhaps even the odd bit of actual food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cadwell advises caution. "On the one hand there's a safety-driven concern, that if you're doing something like a fecal microbiome transplant, what else are you bringing over.. that's why it's very dangerous for people to do DIY type things with a blender, right? ...You want to really know what else is there, you don't know if it's good or bad, and just because it's good for somebody else it could be dangerous for you if you're a recipient when you have an underlying condition." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in principle we may well be not far from the day when we see certain viruses as valuable sidekicks — even ones we might want to supplement with: "If the thought is that infectious entities like bacteria can tune your immune system or other aspects of your physiology in ways that you want it to to prevent or treat a disease, you could certainly say the same thing about other infectious agents like viruses," Cadwell said. The proof of principle of this has been done in mouse models, by him and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The question," he said, "is who's willing to try out these things in humans?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it might be tempting to answer: RFK Jr — and to imagine that this is why he's hard at work &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-placebos-covid.html" target="_blank"&gt;reducing Americans' access to vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against dangerous viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoting spread of H5N1 bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, and shutting down&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank"&gt; research into antiviral mRNA vaccines that might save us from that same bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, among other viruses — the science does not remotely support the idea that adding opportunities to get infected with viruses is good for our health. On the contrary. With enough research, though, perhaps one day we will actually know how to use these often vicious, sometimes beneficial partners to our advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's relatively new, this concept of the virome, and I think we're at a stage where we're going to start generating a lot of information," Cadwell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, but about that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like virtually all science and health related work in the United States, this blossoming field is at risk of being nipped in the bud by cuts to federal funding, shifting funding priorities, and outright prohibitions. In particular, virologists point to Donald Trump's May 5th executive order &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/improving-the-safety-and-security-of-biological-research/" target="_blank"&gt;banning gain-of-function research&lt;/a&gt; as a potential disaster that is worded in such as way that it could well be applied to an extremely wide range of research activities. Angela Rasmussen, an American virologist who teaches at the University of Saskatchewan and is a research scientist at the &lt;a href="https://www.vido.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Organization-International Vaccine Centre&lt;/a&gt;, says that while the Department of Health and Human Services, especially NIH director Jay Bhattacharya, minimizes the impact of the order — as if it will affect only the teensy-teensiest bit of nefarious research — the EO in fact uses a vastly expanded definition of gain-of-function research. Rasmussen says the previous version was also unclear about how it would be interpreted: the new EO is far worse in this respect. The fact is that Dr. Evil and his fellow fictional evil and/or mad scientists are far from the only biologists who make regular use of gain-of-function research, or whose work may be seriously affected by the EO, among other administration acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the parameters that is forbidden is to put an antibiotic resistance marker into a pathogen. That basically describes all molecular cloning, because we use antibiotic resistance markers to select for the clones that we develop, and we select for them by putting them into E. coli," explained Rasmussen in a phone interview with Salon. In a subtle dig at &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-does-us-food-safety-work-what-cuts-has-trump-made-2025-05-07/" target="_blank"&gt;the Trump administration's multiple cuts to the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, including to food safety assurance programs and quality control testing of certain leafy greens, Rasmussen explained that lab strains of E.coli are not like the kind you're going to get from eating contaminated lettuce. They're not that pathogenic. Still, technically they do count as pathogens just because they could cause urinary tract infections or harm people with compromised immune systems, like so many things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So the question then becomes, how is this going to be regulated? Does it refer to all pathogens?" Rasmussen asked. "And there's language in the executive order that says it does apply to even pathogens that aren't very pathogenic. And you know, there's many other things in that executive order that are not sufficiently described, and they could be interpreted very broadly, and that would have the effect of shutting down quite a lot of research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cadwell agrees. "I think the issue is the language is so vague that we don't know ...Gain-of-function, depending on who you ask, could be anything that manipulates the virus," he explained. "Most things we do to a virus makes it weaker or not work as well, or maybe you're trying to engineer it for therapeutics, and I'd hate to see somebody throw cold water on that." Far from improving the fitness of a virus (gaining fitness being a very different thing from gaining function), most gain-of-function work is, Cadwell said, more like trying to make a virus green so it's easier to observe — things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example Rasmussen offers is from a different part of the EO where it is stated that "you're not allowed to disrupt a beneficial [immune] response. You could make the argument," Rasmussen said, "that that type of ban would prevent a lot of different kinds of vaccine research, some of which are currently critical to actually doing pre-clinical studies on vaccines and developing new vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need it for testing vaccines. You would need it to understand the basics of how this pathogen causes disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said that her PhD work, which involved adapting human cold virus to infect mouse cells so that it could be studied in mice, might have been banned under another article of the EO, which prohibits altering the host range of an agent or toxin. "The way that this is written, it basically would prevent development of all rodent models," except perhaps those that exclusively use a wild-type virus or toxin. "Certainly for viruses, it's very, very common to make pathogenesis models that you would need for testing drugs. You need it for testing vaccines. You would need it to understand the basics of how this pathogen causes disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen, for example, has studied Ebola using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, which is a necessary adaptation in order to study the disease in mice in a way that's comparable to humans. The particular virus she used in this case was made 20 years ago, she said — by the US Army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, she said, "the pharmaceutical industry's attitude has kind of been like, wait and see." But there are at least two different aspects of the industry that this could affect. "One is pharmaceutical development, because they do talk about the need to develop independent oversight that would apply to both federally funded labs initially, but also to any other life sciences labs that would potentially be doing this kind of work, whether they're funded by the federal government or not."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other aspects of implementation, there's no clarity about how this will work. "The other issue that will affect industry is the risks that they talk about about nucleic acid synthesis screening." This, Rasmussen said, is the government's apparent belief that you can just call up a company that sells vital research equipment, and order a dangerous virus. "Just like, order up some smallpox," she says, as an example (in fact, you cannot and never could call up a nucleic acid synthesis company and order smallpox, and most major companies already screen orders. For example, you cannot order up a batch of the influenza virus that killed millions of people in 1918). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So they want these sequence providers to screen orders to make sure that people aren't trying to order select agents or trying to order dangerous pathogens that they could potentially do under-the-radar gain of function research with or carry out some other type of nefarious attack with it." Since the necessary screening is already in place, Rasmussen asks what is likely to change. "What would be the compliance mechanism, who's going to [enforce it]... what are the consequences going to be?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive order is written, Rasmussen says, on the (unproven) premise that the Biden administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research with insufficient oversight and also approved federal life science research funding in countries with limited oversight or expectation of biosafety enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And this executive order is 'necessary to prevent future lab leak pandemics', which of course, don't happen," Rasmussen said, making air quotes. "So how are they going to prevent future lab leak pandemics by cutting the federal research budget?" she asked rhetorically, going on to say that "this is going to provide both a presidential order as well as supposedly scientific justification for making a lot of those cuts to pathogen research in particular... so really, I think this executive order is meant to further justify and validate changes that are being made to pathogen research and vaccine research." She also worries about selective enforcement of the vague terms of the order to target some researchers or research projects for political or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen noted that many grants are now simply in limbo, with researchers whose funding applications have advanced to the point where a decision should be made, but then never seem to move on to the advisory council that makes that final call. Or they go to the council, but a notice of award never comes, or perhaps it's in process: nobody knows. Multiyear grants for projects already in motion — which includes purchase of equipment and hiring of staff — are in limbo, with their current year of funding not forthcoming, but no clarity about whether funding has been cut or merely delayed and for how long, or whether it's been cut permanently. From what Rasmussen hears from faculty members at Columbia, where she did her PhD, every single Medical Center grant has been cut, with no NIH grants preserved at the university at all. Salon reached out to two leads on the VAST project to ask if it's been affected by cuts or other changes. One did not respond; scheduling difficulties meant that Salon had not received a response to written questions posed to the other scientist, Stanford Medicine geneticist Michael Snyder, by press time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A lot of these termination orders and work orders are illegal. It's illegal to just cancel a grant for no reason and not provide an appeals process. I mean, it's federal money. There is a peer review process for awarding these grants. And I don't know that anybody knows [what will happen] because this is so unprecedented." The uncertainty, unemployment, and fear of de-funding among her scientist colleagues are taking an immense emotional toll, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cadwell remains hopeful that despite the short-term obstacles, the future simply has to be bright for work that will bring the mysteries of this viral microbiome to light for the benefit of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure what the future of [projects to fund virome research] will be, with the realignment of the NIH...but I think the community of scientists, both within and outside the field, are really excited about [studying the virome], and I'd be surprised if we can't keep up the momentum into the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a newborn was like having a colony of new anxieties implanted in her mind. Was she feeding her child right, using the right chemical-free lotions, posing the right questions to her doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Social media and text exchanges about vaccine skepticism combined to sharpen that angst. Ms. Villasana-Espinoza, 29, who lives in the Atlanta area and has a 1-year-old daughter, did not bargain for becoming a mother while, all around her, people were embracing medical skepticism with new ferocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Villasana-Espinoza was recently at a church dinner, a weekly event in which families pay $5 and bring their children for boisterous meals with big portions of pasta or taco salad. One mother sat down at the dinner table and brought out her own glass bottle of raw milk. Ms. Villasana-Espinoza, who had grown up in a rural area and had gotten sick several times from drinking raw milk, was taken aback. Her church leans conservative, but its members have fairly conventional views on health. The raw milk seemed to her like a dog whistle for “Make America Healthy Again” — the slogan and ethos that is now also a presidential commission led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the car ride home, Ms. Villasana-Espinoza and her husband discussed the raw milk moment, and whether that family was likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The Venn diagram of people who drink raw milk and people who think vaccines are bad for you is basically a circle,” Ms. Villasana-Espinoza recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Becoming a mother now means confronting a grab bag of voices — on phone screens and on Reddit, but also at school pickup and church — that are critical of the medical establishment, including people skeptical about vaccines and fanatic about drinking raw milk. Doctors say that during the Covid-19 pandemic, large pockets of people, especially parents, lost trust in experts and started doing research into unconventional and discredited ways of caring for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, kinesiology researchers have released a study that establishes a direct link between ultra-processed foods and poor health. Specifically, these foods trigger a response in our bodies similar to the one triggered by contact with a pathogen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory Response to Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that junk food is now a significant public health issue. By the end of 2024, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a disturbing report. According to the report, this type of diet carries hidden health costs that total up to $8.1 trillion, which can represent up to 10% of the GDP in some countries. A major reason is the widespread shift from whole grains to processed products, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These processed, or rather ultra-processed, products are increasingly concerning, as highlighted by a new study published in the journal Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism on May 7, 2025. According to kinesiology researchers from McMaster University in Canada, there’s a strong connection between the consumption of these foods and the production of C-reactive protein (CRP). This protein is produced by the liver in response to an inflammatory or infectious state in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that our bodies perceive these foods as foreign objects and not as food. It’s crucial to note that these aren’t whole foods but rather substances extracted from foods or chemical solutions, causing our bodies to detect them in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Displacing Healthier Food Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers analyzed data from 6,000 individuals in Canada, covering a broad range of ages, health conditions, and socio-economic backgrounds. These participants completed a questionnaire related to a survey conducted by Health Canada, followed by a personal evaluation at mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that on average, participants consumed more than three servings of ultra-processed foods per day, with the highest consumers averaging six servings per day. These high consumers were more likely to be men with lower incomes and lower educational levels. According to the researchers, ultra-processed foods tend to replace healthier options like fruits and vegetables in the diets of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ultra-processed foods currently account for nearly 45% of the daily energy intake of Canadian citizens aged 20 and older, the concern is warranted. Furthermore, while this study focuses on Canada, similar conclusions could apply to the United States and, to a lesser extent, some European and Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoga and Pilates are two forms of movement that often get grouped together. They each deserve a place in anyone’s routine thanks to their long roll call of benefits for both mind and body, but which is better for beginners? And how can you tell if you would respond better to a yoga flow or a Pilates routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tina Traina is especially well placed to explain the differences. An experienced yoga and Pilates teacher, Traina is head of the Mind &amp;amp; Body studios at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;David Lloyd Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, where she has devised a yoga-Pilates fusion class that builds strength, alignment, mobility and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of overlaps with some of the exercises and key benefits,” Traina tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “And I wouldn't necessarily steer someone towards one or the other, I would try to incorporate both disciplines in your training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she adds, there are a few points of difference worth understanding before you sign up to one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-yoga-promotes-greater-mind-body-connection"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Yoga promotes greater mind-body connection &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of yoga involves forging a closer bond between your mind and body by harnessing your breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Jordi Salas / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its centuries-old origins, yoga is a holistic system that incorporates spiritual practices too. Yoga asana (postures)—the movement side of yoga—is just one element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yoga definitely taps into more of the spiritual aspect and the mind-body connection thanks to the inclusion of periods of meditation,” says Traina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, she admits, can put some people off, but the principle is to forge a closer bond between your mind and body by harnessing your breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDQUZ4gqajJVf6YXtyXXVQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDQUZ4gqajJVf6YXtyXXVQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In yoga, the breath is mainly used for focus, so you’re using the breath to relax the mind and to focus your energy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-pilates-will-teach-you-to-engage-your-core"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Pilates will teach you to engage your core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pilates there is also a heavy emphasis on controlling your breathing, but it’s primarily used to engage the core. “The breath is into the ribs and the focus is on diaphragmatic breathing, breathing to engage the core muscles,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastering diaphragmatic breathing will help you learn how to subconsciously activate your core muscles to support your spine when performing strength exercises and lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-yoga-tends-to-involve-more-full-body-movements"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Yoga tends to involve more full-body movements &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an extensive collection of postures for teachers to draw from, it’s rare that you won't engage your whole body when practising yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates, by contrast, “tends to involve higher repetitions of individual movements focused on body alignment” that will target individual muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can make Pilates a safer option if you need to manage a lingering injury, allowing you to precisely target muscle groups and avoid vulnerable joints, although both Pilates and yoga teachers will be able to adjust a class to suit existing injuries—just make sure you speak up and let them know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-pilates-drills-more-precise-body-alignment"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Pilates drills more precise body alignment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Catherine Delahaye / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both yoga and Pilates are typically low-impact, making them a wise choice for beginners and older adults, the pace and tempo of each can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the type of class, a yoga flow might follow a slower, more restorative tempo, or be more dynamic and fast-paced, which is usually an Ashtanga style,” says Traina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater emphasis is also placed on listening to your body and being free in the movement, she adds, while Pilates instructors tend to encourage a more precise body alignment with each pose to promote better posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-pilates-is-safer-if-you-are-hypermobile"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pilates is safer if you are hypermobile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly assumed points of difference is that yoga improves flexibility, whereas Pilates builds strength. In reality, both disciplines can build strength and flexibility, but some bodies might respond better to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hypermobility_Syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hypermobility_Syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;hypermobile&lt;/a&gt;, and have naturally looser connective tissue around your joints and ligaments, you might be better off building strength through Pilates-based movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn't say one stretch is better in Pilates and another is better in yoga,” says Traina. “There is just a different focus on them.” Yoga postures, for example, tend to be held for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Pilates, you might be stretching into repetitions, but you will still benefit from mobile joints and stretched muscles that will support better posture in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee has antioxidants that may lower your risk of disease when consumed in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much caffeine can cause heart issues, anxiety and poor sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee isn’t harmful in moderation, but it can't make up for an unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My husband can’t start the day without his morning coffee. He’s not the kind of guy who can wait to get to the office before having some coffee. On workdays, he wakes up as much as two hours early to make sure that he has time to prepare and enjoy his cups of joe. In other words, it’s very much a lifestyle for him. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; His stringent adherence to his ritual makes me worry. I’m a tea drinker and enjoy a bag of green or black leaves every morning, but if I need to go without it, I can. I don’t mind the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-coffee-makers-8415084" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;our coffee makers&lt;/a&gt; are seemingly always at work. But in recent months, I have grown concerned about my husband’s health, as he has started drinking around a pot of coffee by himself each day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Is his habit harmless or harmful? I spoke with health experts and dug into the science to find out. Here’s what I learned.

She grinds locally roasted beans each morning and adds organic half-and-half. “There's really compelling research that shows a lot of health benefits with regular coffee consumption,” she says. “The thing I like to point out is that coffee mainly contains caffeine and something called polyphenols.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polyphenols, she explains, are molecules with antioxidant properties that can fight the body’s cell damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Polyphenols are also warriors against inflammation. In fact, research shows that compounds in coffee (including chlorogenic acid, diterpenes and trigonelline) have been found to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mitigate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and stave off degenerative disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Those include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, chronic kidney disease and liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us grew up being told that caffeine was detrimental to our health, but in many cases, that school of thought is now démodé. &lt;a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/stephanie-coulter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephanie Coulter, M.D., FACC, FASE&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist, points to a 2023 review on the impact of coffee consumption on cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The meta-analysis of 17 recent studies, which looked at more than 230,000 participants, found that “moderate coffee consumption leads to a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure and atrial fibrillation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Most of the studies and observational data sets have shown that moderate consumption is associated with less risk,” Coulter adds. “That means that if it’s something that you love to enjoy, at best it may be good for you in moderation, but at worst, it’s not harming you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-risks-of-too-much-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Risks of Too Much Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, if you drink coffee moderately, you’re probably in the clear. But what about if you’re like my husband? The first issue that Coulter brings up is sleep. In 2022, the American Heart Association added sleep to its official checklist of cardiovascular health factors, alongside diet and physical activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coulter cautions that drinking too much coffee too close to bedtime (usually meaning after 6 p.m.) could interfere with that vital rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter explains that 400 milligrams or less of caffeine a day is considered moderate consumption, which is what health authorities recommend as the upper limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s the amount you’ll find in about four cups of coffee. My husband often drinks more than that, so is he at risk, even if his sleep is usually not disrupted by drinking a steamy mug with dessert?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter and Polgreen highlight that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;signs of too much caffeine&lt;/a&gt; include an elevated heart rate, palpitations and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, as well as anxiety and headache. ”We know without a shadow of the doubt that people with lower blood pressures on average as they age have less heart failure, less heart attack, less stroke, less kidney disease and, even better, less cognitive decline, so overconsuming any substances that raise your blood pressure over time probably is not beneficial,” says Coulter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polgreen says that she considers one or two cups a day to be safest for her clients. Though the cardiovascular issues are cumulative with regular caffeine consumption, others—like anxiety—can be a daily battle. That’s because caffeine may elevate your cortisol, a stress hormone. But fortunately, coffee lover Polgreen has a hack for that. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You never want to drink coffee on an empty stomach because what that does is it could actually spike your cortisol,” Polgreen explains. “So even adding in something small with that coffee in the morning can make people feel a lot more regulated throughout the day.” She recommends waiting until after breakfast to have your first cup. Can’t bear the wait? She says that even a protein bar or a handful of nuts could lower your post-java jitters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-does-timing-matter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Does Timing Matter? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In short, it probably does. A new study of American adults and their mortality relating to the timing of their coffee drinking found that people who took their coffee in the morning had a lower risk of early death tied to cardiovascular disease than those who enjoyed it throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why? As Coulter mentioned, sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining your heart's health and well-being. However, there is also some evidence that coffee can act as a balm to inflammation that can reach its peak just after we wake up. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another advantage to drinking coffee first thing in the morning? It can help you poop. Just as you stretch out and start your day, your bowels switch from their sleeping state to a state of wakefulness. If you drink your coffee when your gut is most active, it may help to clean out your colon faster.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-so-is-it-okay-to-continue-enjoying-your-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; So, Is It Okay to Continue Enjoying Your Coffee? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From one perspective, coffee is a relatively neutral entity. Black coffee contains a negligible amount of calories, so whatever you add to it might cause more problems than the beans themselves. In fact, if you take your cup with sugar or artificial sweeteners, that may be where inflammation can enter the picture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polgreen says flavored coffee creamers are one of the worst culprits for sneaking sugar. And while a little added sugar won’t damage your health, excessive consumption increases your risk of chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re looking for another way to boost the flavor, she recommends adding cinnamon to your cup. “Cinnamon has also been shown to be really great for blood sugar regulation, so not only does it taste great, but it does have its own health benefits,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that limiting added sugar can also be beneficial in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. A new study demonstrated that women who drank two cups of black coffee each day metabolized glucose better than those who didn’t drink coffee on a daily basis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A recent review of other studies on coffee consumption found ties to both longevity and a healthier lifespan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s worth noting that researchers found similar bioactive ingredients in tea and chocolate, so those of us who don’t drink coffee but enjoy either tea or chocolate can reap those benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter notes that since stopping at a coffee shop can be expensive, the same health advantages associated with affluence may influence studies of those who drink coffee versus those who don’t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She’s also quick to say that the best thing for people is to take care of themselves, despite the fact that coffee likely has some healthful benefits. That means incorporating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;, such as eating nutrient-dense meals, prioritizing sleep and staying active through regular movement. She mentions that doing these each day has no replacement. “You can't drink coffee to combat a terrible lifestyle,” she says. “You can't get by with being bad by drinking coffee.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite a bit of cynicism in reference to studies, Coulter is convinced that coffee isn’t harmful to the heart, or any other system, for that matter. “The take-home message about coffee is that people have tried to say it's bad for you for decades, and no one can find any strong data in the moderate consumers to suggest that it's true,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The literal take-home message for me? Though there’s nothing wrong with moderate consumption of my husband’s favorite beans, there has been less written about healthy people who drink more than five cups a day. It’s probably time to work on getting down to a couple of cups each morning, after a small meal. But reading up and talking to the experts allayed many of my fears. Coffee, like everything else, requires moderation. Wish me luck as I tell my husband that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQYnpTUTNPNVR6cUhHalVzUjU1RzZQd0Q5YkF6YmV5T05faFdFeDRLcWs0RWZsUzVtY3ExeE9INFhBZ2FmZDVual84YnZVbDJIZHVLWW1ITVl4azYxcmhSV3BFdEVvdTFzZ1BwTmtnV3IxTW9Ib0hwSGlFbTBESzVLZg</guid></item><item><title>600万只鸡的死亡和计数- Daily Kos | 6 million Chickens Dead and Counting - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNS3VMOWtjbElFaHF3eFV0VGROa3JBUV9QbHFTYmVPdWgzbHFfanR4NHE5LTdudnZja0NRN1paVVRRc2dSaW9yNHVwU09mZHFhaEN4ZXdVcnNWeWFoZFczLW1SM3lZb1ZmQkpSU0NhaTNDakZmQTUxTl90QzdaTkVNSlNURHBadXlMOHdmYng1WkV5Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone health is crucial at every stage of life and often overlooked in our health priorities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating foods like tofu, prunes, kale and salmon can significantly boost bone strength. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular exercise, balanced nutrition and moderating caffeine and alcohol consumption are key. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we think about our health, we often focus on our skin, gut, or immune health—but how often do we stop to think about the health of our bones? “We all have them,” says Jacqueline Klunk, M.S., RDN, LDN. During her presentation at the 2024 Food and Nutrition Conference and Expo, where thousands of dietitians and nutrition experts gather annually, Klunk emphasized the importance of bone health and why it deserves more attention. She explains, “According to the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation, about 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and about 44 million Americans have low bone density. Which is about half of all adults over age 50 at serious risk of breaking a bone.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These statistics may sound alarming, but the good news is that with the right dietary choices, we can greatly improve the health and strength of our bones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although hidden beneath layers of skin and muscle, our bones play a vital role in the body. They provide a sturdy framework, keeping us upright, protecting vital organs and serving as storage for critical nutrients like calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES, explains, “Bone health is important at every stage of life.” She highlights how during childhood and adolescence, the focus is on building peak bone mass, a process that typically concludes in the mid-20s. Afterward, the goal shifts to maintaining bone mass and preventing loss. Across all stages of life, however, Derocha stresses the importance of a well-rounded diet rich in bone-supporting nutrients to sustain long-term health and quality of life. You can find these nutrients in the six foods we’ve identified as essential for boosting your bone health, which we explore below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-tofu"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Tofu  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Plant-based eaters know that tofu is a fantastic source of protein, but did you know that tofu also packs a bone-building nutrient? “A lot of tofu is set in a calcium solution, which makes it higher in calcium,” says Klunk. She recommends checking the label to be sure. A ½-cup serving of firm tofu in calcium solution contains a whopping 861 milligrams of calcium—making it an excellent source—along with 22 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consuming enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; is essential for maintaining bone density, and not getting enough can lead the body to pull calcium from the bones which can lead to weak bones over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu also brings a world of culinary possibilities. It's a blank slate available to take on any flavor you add to it—from sweet to spicy and umami. It can work as a scrambled egg substitute (try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tofu-scramble-8559643" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tofu Scramble with Spinach&lt;/a&gt; recipe) or, as in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264669/tofu-crumbles/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tofu Crumbles&lt;/a&gt; recipe, can be used in place of ground meat in tacos or pasta. If you’re in the mood for something sweet, use silken tofu to whip up creamy puddings or desserts like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252791/chocolate-raspberry-tofu-pie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chocolate Raspberry Tofu Pie&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-prunes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Prunes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know that sweet, chewy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; can support your bones? Derocha explains these little gems are jam-packed with nutrients that support strong bones, including vitamin K, which she says plays a critical role in regulating calcium balance and supporting bone formation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prunes also contain potassium, which helps keep calcium in the bones, and manganese, which is essential for forming bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a serving of prunes, which is about ¼ cup, gives you a few bone-supporting nutrients and a serving of fruit, which is perfect to take with you on the go.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Toss a few prunes in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-fruits-you-should-add-to-smoothies-8675944" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for natural sweetness, or try mixing them into salads or yogurt or batters—prune pancakes, anyone? Plus they contain fiber, great to have handy if you ever find yourself &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8057962/prunes-improve-gut-health-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;backed up&lt;/a&gt;! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another delicious food to support your bones requires you to grab a spoon: yogurt! Yogurt provides multiple nutrients that support bone health—it's high in calcium, vitamin D and protein, says Klunk. If you are looking to boost your calcium intake, opt for regular yogurt over Greek yogurt, as regular contains almost 50% of your Daily Value for calcium—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877433/which-is-healthier-greek-yogurt-or-regular-yogurt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;almost double that of Greek yogurt.&lt;/a&gt; If you prefer a plant-based option, plant-based yogurt can also be a bone-afide choice for bone health, just make sure to choose a fortified variety to ensure it contains calcium and vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enjoy a cup of yogurt with fruit on top for an easy snack, or stir it into oats for more creaminess and bone-healthy nutrients, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brownie-batter-overnight-oats-8417365" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Brownie Batter Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;. Use yogurt to make healthy sweet treats like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259080/strawberry-chocolate-greek-yogurt-bark/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Strawberry-Chocolate Greek Yogurt Bark&lt;/a&gt; or whip it into creamy sauces, dips or dressings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dive into more salmon to get more nutrients for your bones. A 3-ounce serving of sockeye salmon nearly meets your daily vitamin D needs while also delivering a hearty dose of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Vitamin D is not found naturally in many foods, but is needed by the body to help it absorb calcium effectively. Research has also linked omega-3 fatty acids to improved bone quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you choose fresh, frozen or canned salmon, any option gives you bone benefits and can be prepared in various ways. Add cooked salmon to salads, grain bowls or into wraps. Use canned salmon to make our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8012008/salmon-burgers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Salmon Burgers&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248825/lemony-lentil-salad-with-salmon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemony Lentil Salad with Salmon&lt;/a&gt; recipes.&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248825/lemony-lentil-salad-with-salmon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kale is a superstar among dark leafy greens when it comes to supporting bones. Klunk explains that while some leafy greens, like spinach, are high in oxalates and can inhibit calcium absorption, kale is a fantastic alternative as it’s naturally lower in oxalates. One cup of raw kale provides an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914418/what-is-vitamin-k/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in bone formation and calcium metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Remember to drizzle or massage kale with a healthy source of fat such as olive oil or avocado oil. Not only will it taste delicious, but also vitamin K is fat-soluble and requires fat to be present to be properly absorbed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get creative with kale in the kitchen. Whip up a colorful salad like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/autumn-salad-8351135" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Autumn Salad Recipe&lt;/a&gt;, stir-fry it for a quick side dish, or toss it in a soup or stew near the end of cooking. For a sweet twist, blend kale into smoothies—we promise you won’t even taste it. Check one of our favorites: this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cherry-beet-kale-smoothie-8416081" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Cherry, Beet &amp;amp; Kale Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make room for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8006415/what-is-tahini/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tahini&lt;/a&gt;. This creamy seed butter, made from ground sesame seeds, is packed with bone-loving nutrients. Tahini is rich in calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. Calcium is essential for bone density, while magnesium and phosphorus help with calcium metabolism and bone structure, says Derocha.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can use tahini as a base for salad dressing, simply whisk with a little lemon juice and you’ve got yourself a dairy-free but creamy dressing. Or use it to make our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267210/tahini-yogurt-dip/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tahini-Yogurt Dip&lt;/a&gt;, spread it on toast just as you would peanut butter, or drizzle it over &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262078/colorful-roasted-sheet-pan-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;roasted veggies&lt;/a&gt; for a nutrient boost.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to eating a diet rich in bone-supporting nutrients, there are several lifestyle choices you can make to keep your bones strong and healthy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active&lt;/strong&gt;: Engaging in regular physical activity, whether it's weight-bearing activities like walking, running and dancing or resistance exercises like weightlifting, can all help keep your bones strong. Exercise helps prevent bone loss, making bones more dense and strong, and helps prevent osteoporosis. Aim for a combination of both weight-bearing and resistance-based exercises throughout the week for better health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get annual visits&lt;/strong&gt;: Visiting your doctor for an annual physical is important, as well as requesting lab work to ensure you don’t have any vitamin or mineral deficiencies. If you are low or deficient in nutrients for bone health like vitamin D, ask your health care provider if you should start &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement-8620841" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplementing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit caffeine and alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; High intake of caffeine may promote bone loss, so keep your intake to no more than 400 milligrams per day, which is equal to about 4 cups of coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Drinking alcohol heavily over time can lead to a variety of negative health consequences, and can impact bone health and lead to weaker bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Let’s not forget about our bones. They do so much for us and deserve so much more attention. Add more bone-nourishing foods to your weekly menu. Foods like tofu, prunes, kale, yogurt, salmon and tahini are some of the best foods you should be eating more of for better bone health. In addition, be sure to stay physically active, keep close eye on your lab values and keep your intake of caffeine and alcohol to a moderate amount. Your bones will thank you.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease affects roughly 127.9 million Americans over the age of 20, making it the leading cause of death in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, thanks to ongoing research, it’s becoming easier to prevent, detect and treat heart disease sooner. However, signs of heart disease aren’t always obvious. We spoke with six doctors to better understand eight signs that may indicate a problem and are worth talking to a cardiologist about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You Have Chest Pain or Discomfort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This is likely the most infamous sign of a heart issue. Chest pain may be described as pressure, tightness, heaviness or burning, and it can spread to the arm, neck, jaw or back. Not all chest pain is cardiac-related, but ignoring it can be dangerous,” says &lt;a href="https://welzo.com/pages/dr-blen-tesfu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blen Tesfu, MD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sometimes it is important to see a cardiologist sooner [rather] than later. Some symptoms, such as chest pain, could represent a serious heart issue that requires urgent or even emergency care. Evaluating potential heart problems can prevent them from getting worse and maybe even save your life,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center.

You Have Shortness of Breath &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you feel you are short of breath doing regular activities like walking up stairs, carrying groceries or lying down, it could be more than being out of shape,” Tesfu explains. While being short of breath after &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-activity-for-heart-health-recommended-by-cardiologist-8419619" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; isn’t abnormal, if you notice a sudden change that doesn’t improve over time, it’s best to play it safe and talk with a healthcare professional.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tesfu adds, “Shortness of breath may be a sign that not enough blood is flowing out of the heart, which can be a sign of congestive heart failure or valve disease. A cardiologist can check how well your heart is working and determine if there’s an underlying cardiovascular problem that should be addressed.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some other less common signs of heart disease include feelings of rapid heartbeat and dizziness. If someone has feelings of rapid heartbeat (also referred to as palpitations), especially during exertion, this may also indicate significant underlying heart disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.honorhealth.com/physicians/sheharyar-ali" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sheharyar Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While occasional palpitations are typically benign, experiencing them at high frequency or for a longer duration could be a sign of arrhythmias, [which are] irregular heart rhythms that could raise your risk of stroke or cardiac arrest if not addressed,” adds Tesfu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-you-have-swelling-in-your-legsankles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You Have Swelling in Your Legs/Ankles &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chen highlights swelling of the feet or legs as another potential sign of heart disease. When your heart isn’t working as well as it should, it can’t pump blood efficiently and causes a backup of blood in your lower extremities, such as your calves or ankles. This can cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues and result in a type of swelling known as edema.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Temporary swelling in your lower legs is fairly common and typically harmless. Hot weather, injury, high sodium intake, certain medications, pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-common-habit-can-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure-11693146" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sitting for long periods&lt;/a&gt; (like when taking a long flight) can cause extra fluid to pool in your feet or legs. On the other hand, swelling in both legs (bilateral swelling) that does not subside after a few days—especially when accompanied by other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat or fatigue—are signs that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It occurs when the force of blood pressing against your artery walls is consistently too high, making your heart work harder than it should. Over time, this added strain can weaken your heart and blood vessels and increase your risk of heart failure. “High blood pressure does not always show symptoms, but over time it can quietly do damage and raise your chances of serious heart problems,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.harleystreet.sg/heart/doctors/dr-michael-ross-macdonald/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Michael Ross MacDonald, MD&lt;/a&gt;, senior cardiologist at The Harley Street Heart and Vascular Centre.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s recommended that healthy adults have their blood pressure checked at least once a year, typically during their annual physical.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can also check your blood pressure using an at-home monitor or at your local pharmacy, though it’s important to note that these methods may not be as accurate as having your levels tested by a trained healthcare professional.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unexplained lightheadedness, dizziness or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068952/reasons-youre-tired-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ongoing fatigue&lt;/a&gt; may also be signs of heart issues. “This dizziness happens due to the inability of the heart to increase blood supply to the brain during exertion due to severe underlying blockages in the heart arteries,” says Ali.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brain fog or trouble concentrating is another one. People often assume it’s stress or poor sleep, and many times, that’s exactly what it is. But if it comes with low blood pressure, dizziness or fatigue, I might look into whether the heart’s pumping efficiently enough to keep the brain properly supplied with oxygen,” adds &lt;a href="https://yourdoctors.online/dr-asim-cheema/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Asim Cheema, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiology specialist at Your Doctors Online.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not uncommon for individuals to experience multiple health conditions, known as comorbidities. Having comorbidities can increase a person’s risk of developing other major health issues, such as heart disease. “Individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol also have a greater risk of developing heart disease and should be evaluated by a cardiologist,” explains Darabant.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a family history of heart disease is another major risk factor for developing the condition and a good reason to book an appointment with a preventive cardiologist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If heart disease runs in your family, it is worth being extra cautious, even if you feel fine right now,” says MacDonald.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Darabant agrees, adding, “A family history of heart disease is another important reason since inherited risks can play a major role in future problems and can strongly influence heart health.” He also emphasizes the importance of prevention through a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;. “Unhealthy habits like smoking, being overweight or not exercising regularly add to the risk and make early cardiovascular intervention even more important,” he says. Of course, regular check-ups are also a smart way to stay on top of your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, it’s best to schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional, ideally a cardiologist. “In cardiology, we’re trained to look for patterns—not just dramatic symptoms, but the quiet ones that often get overlooked. The tricky part is that a lot of these signs could point to something heart-related—or they could be from something else entirely. That’s why context matters so much,” says Cheema. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help prevent or catch heart disease early, it’s critical to schedule regular check-ups with a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist or primary care physician.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart concerns should always be taken seriously and discussed with a healthcare professional. While people associate heart disease with obvious symptoms, like sudden, sharp chest pain, it can also present in more subtle and even silent ways. Tesfu urges, “If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms—or even if you are just at high risk because of age, lifestyle or family history—a visit to a cardiologist can be a life-saving move.”&lt;br&gt;

"When we eat nitrate-rich foods like spinach, the body converts nitrates to nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and dilates blood vessels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your blood vessels are dilated and relaxed, Dr. Talreja explains, your blood flow improves and your vascular resistance, which is the resistance against blood flowing through your veins and arteries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This can lead to a modest reduction in systolic blood pressure," he notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also points out that multiple studies support the impact of spinach on systolic blood pressure, singling out one in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25421976/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:randomized crossover trial published in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;randomized crossover trial published in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25421976/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that a diet high in nitrate-rich vegetables such as spinach significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients, particularly when consumed regularly," he says. "The effect may be seen within hours of consumption and can persist with daily intake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, if you're on medication for any cardiovascular issue, spinach isn't a substitute for that!

                    &lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big — and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities — are being hollowed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/department-of-health-and-human-services-to-cut-20000-positions-public-health-agencies-hit-hardest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Health and Human Services to lay off 10,000 workers, close agencies in major restructuring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It’s proposing billions more be slashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That’s one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,” Williams said. “It means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping communities healthy saves lives — and money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic’s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,” Cristino said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="How NIH staffing cuts may delay a promising cancer treatment’s implementation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CScVzOS3J_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won’t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks — if enough people are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mecklenburg County department, with “Protecting and Promoting the Public’s Health” emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You come to work every day and think: What’s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it’s a new disease,” said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg’s director. “That’s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease prevention is unseen — and ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical care can be glamorous — surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It’s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they’ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People don’t appreciate it,” said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. “Therefore, they don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mecklenburg — a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people — has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department’s budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center — arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children’s parents and working late into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,” said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. “We don’t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaos in Washington puts ‘lives at risk’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Exploring the potential impact of Medicaid cuts in Trump's big budget bill" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/koPyOXTxYqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were “broken systems” and reprioritizing resources to “centralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cuts are not about abandoning public health — they’re about reforming it,” spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: “We reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today’s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge’s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Columbus, Ohio — one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts — the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cities complained the cuts had created “severe budget uncertainty” and forced them to redirect their limited resources “to respond to the resulting chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,” Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government’s impractical timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current uncertainty puts lives at risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg’s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With health departments, “there’s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,” said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California’s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Why public health groups are concerned about changes to COVID vaccine recommendations" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1-yMAVF5HM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation — some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,” said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County’s health director. “What really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. … We were still pretty trim, but we weren’t just, like, bones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 — slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts are not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC’s budget, enough to cut the agency’s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without the appropriate funding, we can’t properly address these threats,” he said. “We’re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ungar reported from Charlotte and Louisville, Kentucky, and Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island. Associated Press reporters Mary Conlon in Washington and Kenya Hunter in Atlanta contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research on the microbes living in our digestive tract has triggered a '&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503711/"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;' in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, dietary fiber has become the "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;new protein&lt;/a&gt;", leading to it being added to foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;in abundance&lt;/a&gt; to feed our gut's microbiome and boost our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a study on mice published in 2024 suggests not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna it was the only type of fiber supplement they tested that decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fibers they considered, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types of fiber," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibers are the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/interactions-between-dietary-fibre-and-the-gut-microbiota/0BEF28B809F38D02AC0B1D4E4990210C"&gt;main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria living in our guts, and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary"&gt;yet less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the US consume the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing-fiber-intake"&gt;recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce)&lt;/a&gt; of fiber a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg" alt="A bowl of oats and some oat grains " class="size-full wp-image-133570" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta-glucan is found in oats and barley. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADat1fdGi4/"&gt;ArxOnt/Canva Pro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, fiber supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;'invisible fiber'-infused foods&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;growing in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-the-difference-between-soluble-and-insoluble-fiber"&gt;stick to other materials to form stool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFoD3F-nlec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, "there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileibacterium"&gt;Ileibacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found in the mouse intestine. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy011"&gt;studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; have linked this bacterium to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings align with another recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-023-00767-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; mimic to stimulate insulin release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_124692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg" alt="Fingers Hold Ozempic Pen" class="size-medium wp-image-124692" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs mimic the effects of GLP-1. (imyskin/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Duca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
