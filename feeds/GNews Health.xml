Brain scans revealed increased levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down the brain’s “bliss molecule,” anandamide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance means less natural mood regulation and greater vulnerability to stress and relapse. The findings uncover a potential biological target for treating cannabis use disorder, especially in those who co-use tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Brain Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Co-use of cannabis and tobacco increased FAAH levels, reducing the “bliss molecule” anandamide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The imbalance may explain higher anxiety, depression, and relapse risk among co-users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying this mechanism could guide the development of targeted medications for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who use both cannabis and tobacco show distinct brain changes compared to those who use cannabis alone, according to a new study led by McGill University researchers at the Douglas Research Centre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding may help explain why people who use both cannabis and tobacco often report increased depression and anxiety, and why quitting cannabis is harder for them than for people only using cannabis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first evidence in humans of a molecular mechanism that may underlie why people who use both cannabis and tobacco experience worse outcomes,” said lead author Rachel Rabin, Associate Professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this mechanism is an important step toward finding targets for future medications to treat cannabis use disorder, especially among those that co-use tobacco. Right now, the only available treatments are behavioural therapies such as counselling,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Canada, about one in 20 people who used cannabis in the past year are considered at risk for cannabis use disorder. That figure rises to one in three among people who use it more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tobacco-smoking rates are declining overall, most people who use cannabis also use tobacco, the researchers note. Most studies have looked at cannabis and tobacco in isolation, Rabin added, leaving a gap that this preliminary study begins to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifts in brain’s ‘bliss molecule’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET brain scans revealed that people who used both tobacco and cannabis had higher levels of FAAH, relative to people who only used cannabis. FAAH is the enzyme that breaks down anandamide, a naturally occurring molecule sometimes called the “bliss molecule” for its role in mood and stress regulation. More FAAH means less anandamide, a pattern previously linked to anxiety, depression and relapse when trying to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed scans from 13 young adults. Eight smoked only cannabis, while five also smoked cigarettes daily. Cannabis users averaged just over one gram per day, while cigarette use ranged from one to 12 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the data was originally collected for another study, the research did not include a tobacco-only group. So it’s possible tobacco alone caused the changes. However, the researchers say the results suggest something more is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised us was how strong the effect was, and how different it was from those who only used cannabis, compared to those who used both tobacco and cannabis,” said co-author Romina Mizrahi, Professor of Psychiatry and director of the McGill Research Centre for Cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now recruiting people who smoke cigarettes and people who vape nicotine in a new study to test whether the same brain changes occur without cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study received funding form the National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059119906"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about the effects of smoking tobacco and cannabis together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: People who use both cannabis and tobacco show higher levels of FAAH, an enzyme that breaks down anandamide, which is linked to mood regulation and addiction resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059162464"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The altered brain chemistry could explain why co-users often face greater mental health challenges and find it harder to quit cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761059180210"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What comes next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Scientists are now testing whether similar brain changes occur in people who smoke or vape nicotine without cannabis, to isolate the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dfd1ddd8d59ad0d1c4d5c4d1f4d9d7d3ddd8d89ad7d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2025.100369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;” by Rachel Rabin et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A preliminary investigation of tobacco co-use on endocannabinoid activity in people with cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco is commonly co-used with cannabis. This is unfortunate because tobacco co-use exacerbates select clinical consequences associated with cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence demonstrates that low levels of anandamide, a prominent endocannabinoid, correlate with worse clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) degrades anandamide, and greater FAAH levels may underlie poorer clinical outcomes in people who co-use relative to those who use only cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we tested whether tobacco co-use increases FAAH levels beyond those associated with cannabis use alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis-using participants (N = 13) were parsed into individuals with daily tobacco use (CT, n = 5) and no current tobacco use (CAN, n = 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated group differences in FAAH, quantified using positron emission tomography and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CURB, while controlling for sex and FAAH genotype in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, sensorimotor striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. A significant group x ROI interaction for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CURB λk&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [F(5, 45)= 3.15, p = 0.016] emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests indicated greater FAAH levels in CT compared to CAN in the substantia nigra (p = 0.023, d=1.54) and cerebellum (p = 0.003, d=1.76), while a trend emerged in the sensorimotor striatum (p = 0.054, d=1.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings suggest that tobacco co-use is associated with elevated FAAH activity relative to cannabis-only use, which may underlie poorer clinical outcomes associated with co-use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:10:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1QNE1peVEwWkdhT1ZGU29GbkZoNVYwSUZ6blZ0NDQwSHRBQU1US2FSVUZjZ0xiNUJBd201MmFDdFFsN3Nqd3ozMTN1SVRQNndiV2R2WXVNZTcwdEMxRFdtRUxKVXlCNzJJVGRnQ1o3aTRLS05lSzJLUVZ3</guid></item><item><title>Ig诺贝尔奖获奖“屁股呼吸”技术离拯救生命又近了一步- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/ig-nobel-winning-butt-breathing-technique-moves-one-step-closer-to-saving-lives-81255</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;The results of the first clinical trial of “enteral ventilation” have been published, and are considered a success, a step along the road to a treatment that could save many lives and prevent even more injuries. Such events happen every day as medicine progresses, but this one stands out because “enteral ventilation” is more popularly known as “butt-breathing” or a few other names you can probably fill in for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dna-discovery-signals-a-bum-breathing-turtles-survival-63657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Australian turtle species&lt;/a&gt; have found a way to delay the dangers of coming to the surface to breathe by extracting oxygen dissolved in water using their &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-its-so-damn-hard-to-tell-the-sex-of-a-dinosaur-79503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cloaca&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, they have gill-like features in their bums that supplement their oxygen intake. &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dragonfly-babies-breathe-through-their-butts-but-thats-not-all-76934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-pasted="true"&gt;Dragonfly nymphs do something similar&lt;/a&gt;, and even expel the water afterwards as a form of jet propulsion. This, however, is Australia, and you can probably find seventeen weirder animal behaviors within a stone’s throw of a butt-breathing turtle (arguably including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-endangered-turtle-breathes-out-of-its-butt-and-is-one-of-the-most-evolutionarily-distinct-reptiles-on-the-planet-47107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their headwear&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical applications were probably not the first thing on the mind of those who discovered the trait. However, sick of watching patients struggle for breath with various lung conditions, and inspired by loaches (fish that process air through their stomachs), Dr Takanori Takebe of the Institute of Science, Tokyo, proposed to take an algal leaf out of the turtles’ book. Inevitably, the work was awarded the 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dead-trout-swimming-and-pigeon-missiles-2024-ig-nobel-prizes-are-outrageous-as-ever-75943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ig Nobel physiology prize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pigs-and-rodents-can-breathe-through-their-rectums-so-we-probably-can-too-59716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;demonstrating the viability&lt;/a&gt; of mammals being able to breathe through their butts on some no doubt surprised pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the challenges of getting taken seriously, Takebe has ploughed ahead, and the first results are promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takebe stressed in a &lt;a href="https://scienceblog.cincinnatichildrens.org/ignobel-butt-breathing-idea-from-2024-moves-closer-to-real-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reptiles’ metabolisms are so much slower than those of mammals that they need far less oxygen, so it is perhaps unsurprising that they can get useful amounts this way. Even then, no known turtle species can rely entirely on this approach for their oxygen needs, the highest being about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Takebe and colleagues knew they couldn’t just blow some air up a patient’s ass to keep their blood oxygenated. Their approach is to create a liquid rich in dissolved oxygen, much like deep-sea divers used in the science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, but provide it anally for absorption through the colon. After all, if nutrients can make their way from the intestine straight to the blood, why not oxygen? The liquid, perfluorodecalin, can hold 40-50 times as much oxygen by volume as can be dissolved in water, and about twice as much as human blood holds, but releases it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the idea actually requires less advanced technology than mechanical ventilators when lungs are failing, and so might be available in remote regions or where finances are more limited. Moreover, ventilators can cause lung injuries, with long-term consequences for the short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, 27 healthy Japanese men were administered perfluorodecalin liquid rectally and asked to hold it for 60 minutes. Quantities were increased through the trial, in some cases reaching a liter and a half of the liquid. Twenty of the 27 reached the 60-minute goal, and while those on the larger amounts reported some discomfort and abdominal bloating, there were no serious side effects, nor detectable absorption of the liquid. Discomfort appeared to have been associated with not having defecated during the previous 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="87126" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;People have yet to breathe through their butts, but the study showed the carrier liquid is safe, making a first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Med&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, this was just a safety test, and the perfluorodecalin was not carrying oxygen. Trials using an oxygenated version of the liquid will be next, still on healthy volunteers. If these are similarly successful, the team will move on to those struggling to breathe. They hope the work will be particularly useful for newborns whose lungs are not yet operating properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2313680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1.5 million critically ill adults&lt;/a&gt; undergoing tracheal intubation each year in the USA alone, 10-20 percent of whom suffer damagingly low oxygen levels, there is the potential for widespread demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the way influencers try to turn everything into a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fibermaxxing-valid-health-hack-or-a-fast-pass-to-flatulence-80291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wellness trend&lt;/a&gt;, we do have some concerns, however, and would rather not be around when yoga instructors encourage participants to “breathe out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are expensive, and gaining funding is always a struggle, but that challenge has increased exponentially this year. Takebe is taking advantage of the publicity the work attracts to seek funds, and said that the better that goes, the faster research can progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Med&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:43:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQUlRybnFNa1VFdElJQWVxeDduTVB4QnVpQXV5VEZjSTVBSlBYbGJnOElBcXVKRjQ1OEVzSnZpUHVIUEVUUHh0WHRoWnVlbFZXcmM3TFBmS3lvalpiLTFKTEI1UVBmQzAxRE4wX181ZF96Z1NPaHFBWkxsR1J2dGZkNi1FWFY3czdPQ1RJaXZDYm80ajRiMHZxeDVYLXdjekJTVExvRXhycEhORENXbVF1RDhn</guid></item><item><title>数百万女性经历更年期副作用，但不要谈论... “大规模系统故障” -《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15209505/menopause-symptoms-word-retirement-earnings-pay-hormones.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women bracing for &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-09820820-ade8-11f0-a9c9-05d8e0323bf3"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; know to prepare for the hot flashes, mood swings and brain fog, but another side effect of 'the change' occurs outside of the body - and it is rarely spoken about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New research from scientists in Norway and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/sweden/index.html" id="mol-3e98a190-aded-11f0-8a76-4f8cca87e1db"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; has found that a woman's career, specifically her pay, suffers once menopause sets in. The financial penalty from menopause begins at diagnosis and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12487881/Largest-review-menopause-dozens-alleged-therapies-bogus.html"&gt;intensifies over time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The physiological and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6288057/Why-ANXIETY-reaches-time-high-menopause-6-tips-ease-pain.html"&gt;psychological effects of menopause&lt;/a&gt; are being studied in greater depth, but far less is known about the economics of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopause's economic toll is most severe for women without a college degree, especially those in small, private-sector firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The penalty is also amplified for those working in the private sector, particularly in smaller companies and teams with a high proportion of older female colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kacy Fleming, a psychologist and founder of The Fuchsia Tent, a firm dedicated to women's workplace well-being, told the Daily Mail: ‘The 10 percent earnings drop in symptomatic peri/menopausal women reveals a massive system failing; both healthcare and organizations need to step up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Norway, a menopause diagnosis led to a 10 percent reduction in earnings within four years, a consequence of women scaling back their hours or leaving their careers early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scale of this ‘menopause penalty’ was comparable to other major economic setbacks, such as job displacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Menopause doesn't just lead to sick days; it forces permanent work reductions. This is proven by a sharp rise in women relying on disability insurance, which drives the persistent earnings drop (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Darisse, COO and General Counsel of The HRT Club, which creates and sells effective and affordable hormone replacement therapy (HRT), told the Daily Mail: 'These new economic figures highlight a persistent, sad reality: women are often stigmatized for experiencing symptoms like hot flashes and their visible effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Workplaces must create an environment of understanding and support, helping women thrive rather than feel sidelined during this natural life stage.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stanford researchers used Scandinavian population data to demonstrate that menopause directly causes a loss of earnings. By comparing newly diagnosed women to their undiagnosed peers, they isolated menopause as the cause of the economic penalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 20 percent of the US labor force are women nearing or in menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Swedish natural experiment included in the Stanford report proved that timely diagnosis and HRT treatment can prevent economic loss. When women accessed care, their earnings losses were significantly smaller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For women who did not receive adequate treatment, earnings fall by 10 percent within four years, driven by a steady reduction in work hours and exits from the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study confirmed the penalty is preventable. When women received timely treatment like HRT, they had less earnings losses, proving the economic toll is a direct result of inadequate healthcare and support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their study was &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;by the Stanford University Institute for Economic Policy Research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Figure A shows a persistent decline in employment post-diagnosis, indicating a long-term workforce detachment. Figure B confirms a sustained reduction in work hours, proving the earnings penalty hits on both the extensive (leaving jobs) and intensive (reducing hours) margins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming added: 'With women responsible for roughly 80 percent of consumer spending power, this downtrend in our income does not bode well for the global economy.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopause marks the end of a woman's reproductive years through a significant decline in key hormones. This change generates a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep disruption and cognitive difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a universal experience for women who live long enough, its timing, duration and severity are unique to each woman, creating a highly personal yet universal health evolution.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the US workplace offers no safety net for menopause, forcing some women to rely on disability insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Petra Persson, a faculty fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) who led the research &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/menopause-earnings-economics-study"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'We have parental leave policies, and we have policies that support workers when their productivity dips for health reasons, so it makes sense to also have policies that help women during the menopause transition.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The chart shows the symptoms reported by 374 women in a 2023 study by American public health researchers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lack of accommodations or resources for women in menopause forces experienced employees to cut hours or leave careers due to a lack of basic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming said: ‘By not providing adequate support for midlife women, companies are basically throwing 20 years of strategic thinking, organizational knowledge, and problem solving out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From a lost productivity perspective, the numbers are staggering; we're looking at $150 billion in global productivity losses and over $600 billion in healthcare costs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She argued that the disability exit path frames menopause as an individual's failing, burdening the woman and absolving the company of support, despite the condition being highly treatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fleming said: ‘It's maddening when we know that most hormone replacement therapies have been around for years and cost pennies on the dollar.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amy Epstein Gluck, a workplace compliance and ADA expert who chairs the Employment practice at Pierson Ferdinand, told the Daily Mail: ‘For women, symptoms of perimenopause or menopause often begin when they are at the top of their game and at the peak of their earning years, which can derail them without accommodations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gluck said: ‘While menopause, alone, is not a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), its symptoms can lead to limitations on major life activities that warrant accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If employers don’t offer some practical accommodations like temperature control, flexible scheduling, remote options, rest breaks, leave for treatment, role modifications, workers with treatable menopause symptoms may still be pushed toward disability rather than supported to remain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Fleming added: ‘It's not the biology that's disabling; it's the lack of information, treatment access and workplace support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZ2QwdkZIZUZZNldsYWVrUExyM3o3SlZTaXdoX21PTEdxRThHaEtFQ3RlendyOG9KSTl5YkU1b1NhZEZyc3RXM09GSk92SW1wSXpwdVFfcWxiLW1OSWhiUXlHenZleVNWSlZRdHZJY0ktYV91ajVNNENnYkM5ZWtadGRCTkdNcHc4eFIxVm1LM0ZXVUhMbkh3MUFjMW9zb0F2Ny1meENfdm9WX1Y5ZFNRUGxWRdIBuAFBVV95cUxPN0RZSjJTUTRhWVdnTnpiUlh1MjMzeTZKMjJDXzdkaFZ0YXJoNjNEVWpOLUZfS0wyemVsallCem44VnBDSGpoNldNWmdLdWpLTWp5aFZMQ0xnQzltbjNsRDY5UDlVeGhlRVBsWGZyUlcwdll4NWZQSDBrMC1KcGRsQk9MTUk4WmFyRnhNeWFDeE44ajl6N2IybEwtdnh2V29kaVpKdHJYSE1rN2JlZElSQWpFbXhKbXhr</guid></item><item><title>一位老龄化专家揭示了真正导致长寿幸福生活的原因- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/aging-expert-reveals-really-leads-123000899.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Emily Lachtrupp, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design elements: Getty Images. EatingWell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerontologist Susie DiGiovanna, M.S. shares her “three A’s” of healthy aging: activate, adult and accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying social, active and curious is key to longevity and joyful living, DiGiovanna emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of change and planning for the future brings peace, resilience and better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 22 years, Susie DiGiovanna, M.S., has worked in social services for a local municipality, helping older adults and their families navigate the many stages of aging. Through her time running programs, offering counseling and visiting seniors in their homes and at hospitals, she’s observed an abundance of examples of what it truly means to age well—and what can hold people back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like to say that I have a front row seat to what healthy aging looks like and what unhealthy aging looks like,” the gerontologist tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. “It's been very, very educational for me personally and professionally, because I've gotten to know thousands and thousands of older adults through working at a very active senior center.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on those experiences, DiGiovanna distilled her philosophy into three simple but powerful principles: activating yourself, adulting and accepting new realities. She calls them the “three As of healthy aging,” and she explains how to prioritize these core elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Activating Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGiovanna emphasizes that healthy adults are continually “activating” themselves through physical movement, connection and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to make it an actual concerted effort to be socializing, to be physically active, to be just really into what we now call ‘self-care,’ because those things don’t happen automatically or accidentally,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her expert take is backed by science. According to a recent study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;, higher social engagement was linked with lower all-cause mortality. More social activity could mean joining a walking group, attending a fitness class at a senior center, hosting neighborhood potlucks or signing up for a book club. It could also be as simple as catching up with family and friends face-to-face on a more regular basis. These things build accountability, structure and joy, all factors that lead to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of older adults will say to me, ‘Well, I'm not a joiner, I've never been a joiner.’ That’s not a good thing,” DiGiovanna shares. “It is good to enjoy your own company, being alone sometimes, but I would say not being a ‘joiner' is going to work against you when you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adulting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, “adulting” feels pretty obvious, but it’s more than it seems. You may be guilty of not filling out and finalizing the necessary paperwork while in the midst of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even begin to tell you how many people who are older, in their 80s or 90s, that still haven’t done a will or a trust, or a healthcare directive, or even told anyone what they want when they die,” DiGiovanna says. “Do they want to be buried or cremated? These are very important things that a lot of times cause more grief for whoever's left than the person themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may initially feel uncomfortable, these tasks are practical steps to fully embrace aging and life ahead. If you haven’t done so already, this is your reminder to file a will, consider a financial power of attorney, complete a healthcare directive and to talk to your family about the future. And DiGiovanna practices what she preaches, noting that she has completed the check list of healthy aging tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once I did all of those things, it felt great,” DiGiovanna, who is 64 herself, shares. “It feels wonderful to tell your loved ones, ‘This is done, I’ve talked to you about my wishes.’ It’s a peaceful feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accepting New Realities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the hardest of the bunch, but it’s inevitable—and accepting and adjusting your routine to highlight your needs is a healthy way to welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing certain is change,” DiGiovanna notes. “We’re going to continue to change our whole lives.” The expert shares that she sees individuals every day who resist aging by trying to deny their abilities. But straining your body might be doing you more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; found that older adults who were able to cope with life challenges through more resilience had a reduced mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGiovanna stresses that acceptance doesn’t mean giving up, contrary to popular belief. It means adapting to your needs, whether that be taking specialized exercise classes or focusing on the simple things in life that spark you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People that accept and say, ‘You know what, I am a senior,’ they have that openness and that curiosity, that's much more healthy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is all about flowing with time instead of fighting it. DiGiovanna’s three A’s (activating yourself, adulting and accepting new realities) is a needed nudge to remind us that improved longevity on the surface is living longer, but the quality of a joyful life is the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People that have accepted their mortality seem to have a much better attitude,” she reflects. “They seem to have more joy. They seem to have more appreciation that they're alive now, that they have the ability to still do some things. So that acceptance piece, I feel, is a very big part of healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside activity, socialization and focusing on your mental health, you can support healthy aging through your diet.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered how a surface protein on brain cells, called Aplp1, can play a role in spreading material responsible for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease from cell to cell in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promisingly, an FDA-approved  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; drug that targets another protein – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte-activation_gene_3"&gt;Lag3&lt;/a&gt; – which interacts with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APLP1"&gt;Aplp1&lt;/a&gt; – was found to block this process in mice. This suggests a potential treatment for Parkinson's may already exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-49016-3"&gt;paper published last year&lt;/a&gt;, an international team of scientists detailed how the two proteins work together to help toxic clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein"&gt;alpha-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; protein get into brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-hints-at-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;Parkinson's Link to Gut Bacteria Hints at an Unexpected, Simple Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we know how Aplp1 and Lag3 interact, we have a new way of understanding how alpha-synuclein contributes to the disease progression of Parkinson's disease," neuroscientist Xiaobo Mao from Johns Hopkins University &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also suggest that targeting this interaction with drugs could significantly slow the progression of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/parkinson-disease"&gt;More than 8.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; globally have Parkinson's, the &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-disorders/parkinsons-disease-research/parkinsons-disease-challenges-progress-and-promise"&gt;second most common neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt; after  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is progressive and currently incurable, and it's usually only diagnosed when symptoms show. These include tremors, stiffness, balance issues, speech difficulties, disturbed sleep patterns, and mental health issues. In advanced stages, patients may eventually struggle to walk or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Parkinson's symptoms stem from the loss or dysfunction of dopamine-producing neurons in a brain region involved in fine motor control, called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;. This is thought to be caused by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body"&gt;Lewy bodies&lt;/a&gt; – abnormal clumps of protein, primarily made up of misfolded alpha-synuclein, that move from neuron to neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642.jpg" alt="A brown spot on blue and white cells" class="size-full wp-image-140247" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/Alpha-synucleinLewyBodyParkinsons642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alpha-synuclein shown by positive staining (brown) in a Lewy body in the substantia nigra of a patient with Parkinson's disease.

That said, identifying whether this is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-confused-immune-system-could-be-behind-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;a cause of Parkinson's or a symptom&lt;/a&gt; is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah3374"&gt;Past studies&lt;/a&gt; on mice &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011196118"&gt;found Lag3 binds to alpha-synuclein proteins&lt;/a&gt; and spreads Parkinson's disease pathology in neurons. While deleting Lag3 significantly impedes this process, it does not completely prevent it, indicating another protein was also implicated in neurons taking in misfolded alpha-synuclein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work previously demonstrated that Lag3 wasn't the only cell surface protein that helped neurons absorb alpha-synuclein, so we turned to Aplp1 in our most recent experiments," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Valina Dawson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists conducted tests with genetically modified mice that were missing either Aplp1 or Lag3, or both. They found Aplp1 and Lag3 can each independently help brain cells absorb harmful alpha-synuclein, but together they significantly increase the uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_130187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-130187" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image.jpg" alt="A white neuron on black " class="size-full wp-image-130187" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/Aplp1Image-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-130187" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neuron expressing Aplp1 (in white), which allows brain cells to absorb proteins associated with Parkinson's disease. (Yasuyoshi Kimura)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice were missing both Aplp1 and Lag3, 90 percent less of the harmful alpha-synuclein entered healthy brain cells, meaning a greater amount of the harmful protein clumps was blocked with both proteins missing compared with a deletion of just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers gave normal mice the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab/relatlimab"&gt;nivolumab/relatlimab&lt;/a&gt;, a melanoma medication that contains a Lag3  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="178419" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt;, and found that it also stopped Aplp1 and Lag3 from interacting, again almost completely blocking the formation of disease-causing alpha-synuclein clumps in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The anti-Lag3 antibody was successful in preventing further spread of alpha-synuclein seeds in the mouse models and exhibited better efficacy than Lag3-depletion because of Aplp1's close association with Lag3," &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2024/06/new-study-suggests-cancer-drug-could-be-used-to-target-protein-connection-that-spurs-parkinsons-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Ted Dawson, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to test the Lag3 antibody on mouse models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's – where &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202303775"&gt;research has pointed to Lag3&lt;/a&gt; as a target too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-49016-3"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hunters from around the world flock to Athens and neighboring counties every fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the industry and people who depend on it are facing new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/20/chronic-wasting-disease-spread-zombie-deer-global-us-aoe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Chronic wasting disease&lt;/a&gt; (CWD) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are killing wild deer in greater numbers in dozens of rural counties across the midwest that depend on the industry. The number of sick and dead deer reported by the public to Ohio’s department of natural resources grew&lt;a href="https://gis.ohiodnr.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=615d8f4f49f94e2aaff3c7fcd232fde7#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-1990be59c9c-layer-2%3A1047" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; from 2,093 in 2024 to 8,759 this year&lt;/a&gt;. That animals are being found dead in or near creeks and rivers may also present a health risk to communities dependent on local waterways for drinking and other uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CWD is spread from animal to animal through body fluids such as saliva, urine and blood. With drought becoming more prevalent in the region in recent years, larger numbers of deer find themselves gathering at fewer watering spots to drink, fueling the spread of the disease in the early fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the case of EHD, warmer spring and fall temperatures allow for the spread of its carrier, culicoides variipennis, a biting midge that is typically killed off by freezing temperatures. The midge is attracted to mud and water sources, where it lays its eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“While it’s been around for a long time, the frequency and intensity of EDH is increasing, and studies are showing that’s happening especially in the upper midwest,” says Sonja Christensen, associate professor at the department of fisheries and wildlife at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It comes and goes, which makes it a challenge to chase it down. We can’t predict it very well. We do know that in the upper midwest we are seeing more of these large-scale mortality events happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the Ohio department of natural resources, midwestern deer populations infected with EHD are likely to die within three days after the onset of symptoms. CWD, which has a multi-year incubation period, has been detected in cervid species, mostly in deer, in 36 US states and four Canadian provinces, having been first detected in the contiguous US in wild deer in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say that warmer temperatures fueled by human-caused climate change can contribute to conditions that favor both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This year, the conditions were just right. We had a really wet beginning of spring, a really dry summer. The numbers of those midge carriers were up, which is why we’re seeing such a big increase in deer with EHD,” says Lindsey Krusling of the Ohio division of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Ohio, baiting and feeding deer has been banned in disease control areas in the north-west part of the state. Hunters across the midwest are being advised to have venison tested for presence of the diseases and to not eat from animals that appear sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deer hunting nationally is worth around $23bn, with much of that, hunting advocates say, going back into the conservation of forests, woods and wilderness areas that otherwise could be logged for timber, farmed or exploited for mineral and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hunters spend thousands of dollars on trips that outfitters use on food, accommodation, property taxes and the year-round maintenance of deer habitats. Ohio’s deer hunting industry is worth about $1.9bn a year, and in neighboring Pennsylvania, where nearly half a million deer are harvested annually, it’s worth around $2bn. In Michigan&lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2025/09/chronic-wasting-disease-detected-in-genesee-county-deer-for-first-time.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;, where counties are recording first-time case&lt;/a&gt;s of CWD in wild deer as recently as last month, deer hunting contributes about $2.3bn to the state’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aside from fueling rural midwestern economies, hunting whitetail deer also plays an important role in reducing damage to agricultural crops and lowering road accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Neither CWD nor EHD are thought to be transmittable to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The threats and impacts of chronic wasting disease and [epizootic] hemorrhagic disease are very different,” says Kip Adams, chief conservation officer at the National Deer Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With hemorrhagic disease, climate has a big impact. It’s all the way up through the north-east; it’s all the way across the midwest, up into Canada. This disease is far more widespread today than it was 10, 20 or certainly 30 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, while coming across dozens of deer carcasses in the woods may come as a shock to some, observers such as Adams believe the broader population of whitetail deer is not currently at significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While EHD can devastate a local population within a short period of time, scientists say that, given good habitat conditions, they can recover within five years. Moreover, some animals that contract EHD have been known to develop an immunity to the disease that can be lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The threats to local economies is probably going to be very little. Nationally, of all the hunters that go into the field each fall, less than half shoot a single deer. Only about 20% shoot more than one deer,” says Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Overall, there are still plenty of deer; folks can still go hunting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, the challenges of managing the spread of these diseases are not inconsiderable. And funding to study and closely track them can be difficult to come by because they generally don’t directly affect domestic animals or people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Barkhurst, losing a fall season of hunting is about much more than the loss of income that goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“My buddies and I, we’ve been hunting for three generations; it’s fellowship and hanging out. And now, you don’t go,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They’re trying to find something else to keep the group together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxORVBydGljWHktRmU5dzV2X3ZKZkFEaXVyVWxJT1FYVEpEVEVPb0FSeDFUcjNzNXlLT05HRkJRTWRaNWh4WWd3dE9xeHowbVlsRGtWRnBGTU1MUU50V2FkMklOVS1tRUZmU19pWC1ENUFjcDRqcmRaTjRaWFhBcDJYRzVESQ</guid></item><item><title>视频：金毛猎犬不停地看着主人的煎饼，然后再做-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-golden-retrievers-t-stop-120000910.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s nothing quite as tragic as watching someone else eat pancakes — just ask the Leos, the two &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retrievers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retrievers&lt;/a&gt; who share a name. In a video posted by @twogoldenleos, these Denver-based pups face the ultimate test of patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the table sits a half-eaten pancake, and both Leos can’t take their eyes off it. You can almost see the thought bubble in their head: “Why is that pancake not for me?” Their mom’s caption says it best: “Has never had a pancake but also cannot comprehend why these wouldn’t be for him?” And truly, the confusion on the dogs’ face is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retrievers can’t wait to try a pancake and politely ask for some in this video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens with one of the Golden Retrievers standing across the table, laser-focused on that pancake. He lets out a tiny growl, then looks away dramatically, as if pretending not to care. When his mom laughs, he glances back at her like, “Oh, so this is funny to you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A few more soft growls follow before Leo covers his eyes with a paw. Almost as if the sight of the pancake and not getting to eat them is too much for his heart to bear. He truly is overcome by the injustice of it all. Just when you think he’s given up, Leo gives his mom the most unimpressed look imaginable and lets out a single bark, the canine version of “enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then he walks over to join his brother, also named Leo, who’s sitting beside their mom on the couch, staring at the plate with the same mix of longing and hope. Together, the two Golden Retriever boys sit shoulder to shoulder, half drooling, half pleading. They present a united front in the quest for breakfast rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video has racked up over 25K likes, with fans begging in the comments, “Please just give him a pancake already.” One said, “He can’t comprehend why, because everything is for him!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-soluble-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Soluble Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soluble fiber is a powerful ally for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-lower-your-cholesterol-naturally-11769022" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally lowering cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. “For reducing [unfavorable] LDL cholesterol, soluble fiber is particularly important as it can bind to cholesterol in the intestine and help remove it from the body,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.alisonrd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alison Kaplanes, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It works by forming a gel in your digestive tract that traps cholesterol building-blocks called bile acids. “Bile is essential for the digestion and absorption of fats, so the body needs to replace it,” explains &lt;a href="http://ashleyreaver.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashley Reaver, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “It does this by utilizing our cholesterol stores and, thus, lowering our cholesterol levels.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, few of us &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume enough fiber&lt;/a&gt;, including soluble fiber. While a good overall fiber goal is 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, you’ll need 10 to 25 grams of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber for optimal cholesterol-lowering&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Everyday foods like beans, lentils, chickpeas, apples, pears, citrus fruits and bananas are all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15696/is-fiber-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good sources of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;. However, two especially powerful sources are oats and barley. These are rich in beta-glucan, a unique type of soluble fiber with a long, proven cholesterol-lowering track record.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you don’t eat many foods rich in soluble fiber, you can also get it from psyllium husk, often found in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-fiber-supplements-8420645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplements&lt;/a&gt; or added to cereals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-unsaturated-fats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Unsaturated Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; that our bodies need for survival. But the type of fat you eat is important, especially for heart health. “Choose heart-healthy fats instead of animal or dairy fats, which are primarily saturated fat,” Kaplanes advises&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What are those heart-healthy fats, you ask? “The majority of fats should come from unsaturated fats,” says Reaver. There are two main families of unsaturated fats: monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. According to the American Heart Association, both of these fats may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; when used in place of saturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can get monounsaturated fats from avocados, peanut butter, olives, nuts, seeds and olive and canola oils. Polyunsaturated fats are also found in canola oil, as well as soybean oil, tofu, nuts, seeds and fatty fish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3s are unique polyunsaturated fats that are best known for lowering triglycerides (fats in the blood that can also raise heart disease risk). Omega-3s may also help improve overall cholesterol balance by lowering total cholesterol and increasing favorable HDL cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, they have been shown to raise LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may not be a problem for everyone. But if you have high LDL and are considering an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 supplement&lt;/a&gt;, speak with your health care provider first. They may recommend combining an omega-3 supplement with cholesterol-lowering medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While supplements are an easy way to get omega-3s, they’re not the only way. “Eat fish twice a week, especially the SMASH fish with more heart-healthy omega 3s: salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring,” says Kaplanes. These fish are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in EPA and DHA&lt;/a&gt;, two types of long-chain omega-3s that have been studied most for heart protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-plant-sterols"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Plant Sterols &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant sterols, sometimes called phytosterols, are natural compounds found in small amounts in many plant foods. “Plant sterols have a similar chemical structure to the cholesterol from animals and can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb cholesterol from foods,” says Reaver. The result? Less LDL cholesterol makes it into your bloodstream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As helpful as plant sterols are, they only occur naturally in small amounts in a tiny handful of foods, such as corn, canola and soybean oils.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The most reliable way to get them in meaningful amounts is from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-consider-for-high-cholesterol-11784458" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant sterol-fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as fortified spreads, yogurts and milks. Or, talk to your health care provider about a supplement. Research has found that plant sterol supplements can increase beneficial HDL while simultaneously &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290873/how-to-lower-triglycerides-ldl-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lowering total and LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. They may also lower Apo-B, a troublesome protein in the blood that can significantly increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. The good news is, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-11794255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire eating plan. In fact, lower cholesterol often comes down to making a few smart swaps and adding more of the right foods and nutrients. For instance, research has found that soluble fiber, unsaturated fats, omega-3 fats and plant sterols can all help lower cholesterol. While each of these is a win for heart health on its own, they all work in slightly different ways. So, consider adding a few of them to your rotation. Together, they can create a strong &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foundation for heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

Over dinner the night before, he told his mom, Jessica, he wanted to be on the water by 7am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica and JB were unusually close. When her work brought her to Austin, she stayed in his spare room; when the pandemic hit, she moved in for good. Despite a full life – a girlfriend, a job, a side hustle running an online thrift store – he welcomed her. They planted vegetables, packed meals for homeless people, watched true crime, even shared their phone locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That morning, Jessica woke up eager to text him the same silly joke she always sent on his fishing trips: a screenshot of his coordinates – a dot in the water – captioned: “YOU’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But JB’s phone did not show up on the map. It was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica started calling his friends, all of whom had lost track of him the previous night. Then she received a message on Instagram: “URGENT,” it said, next to a phone number. “Call now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB had overdosed on fentanyl and had been found unresponsive in a friend’s apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one knew how long he had been without sufficient oxygen. He was transported to an Austin-area hospital, where the damage became clear: JB had sustained a brain injury and severe damage to his liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By the standard measures of America’s opioid crisis, JB was one of the lucky ones. He did not get added to the nation’s tally of overdose opioids deaths – an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;55,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, and more than 1m over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But having survived, the 30-year-old now lives with life-changing injuries. Five years on, JB cannot walk or talk. After some recent medical setbacks, he also struggles to move, swallow or communicate in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f6855819-9230-4ccf-b945-44295d404e83" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jessica Pizzitola Jarrett feeds her son, John-Bryan ‘JB’ Jarrett, through his feeding tube.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica now provides him near round-the-clock care. She sleeps in his bedroom closet, her makeshift bed wedged between the wall and a rack of clothes, to be close enough to respond to every cry, call, shift of bedsheet, or other sign that JB is in distress. During the day, she works remotely as a social media manager and does her best to keep him engaged and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB’s story highlights a cruel irony: while overdose deaths &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have declined&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to the life-saving drug naloxone (better known by the brand name Narcan), more people are surviving with serious, sometimes devastating complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the epidemic within the epidemic – one we rarely count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I knew JB’s story was not unique: my family had lived through something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My cousin’s only son, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447110/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mason Bogert&lt;/a&gt;, overdosed on synthetic opioids and benzodiazepines when he was 18. He was a shy, kind, gifted kid who loved cats, guacamole and pulling a good prank. He was so adept with computers that he developed a popular weather app at age 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e1266413-5c00-4b44-bb97-86c517abd081" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--immersive element-immersive dcr-imskkt"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tdqfl9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A special ‘PRAY4JB’ license plate and family photographs adorn a kitchen shelf at the Jarrett family home. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he also struggled with anxiety and depression, and self-medicated. His tech skills became an accomplice to addiction: he bought the drugs that almost killed him on the dark web because they could evade detection in urine tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His parents found him without a pulse Mother’s Day morning, 2016. He lived the next five years in need of constant care, shuffling between ICUs, rehabilitation hospitals, and nursing homes across New England. The overdose left him blind and immobilized by spasticity, or very stiff muscles, a condition common with severe brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But, over time, Mason became increasingly aware. He began to communicate by spelling – opening his mouth to signal the correct letter – a method that allowed greater self-expression, and revealed he understood his circumstances and that he was deeply sad and frustrated by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four years into his ordeal, we gathered to celebrate the fact that the earnings from his app had just broken the million-dollar mark – symbolic of a promising, even brilliant young life cut short. He died from pneumonia a few months later, two days after his 23rd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one knows how many people survive opioid overdoses.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10958315/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;best estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that for every fatal overdose, there are 15 non-fatal ones – which puts their number at well over 1m annually in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-2jn2c1"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Surviving an overdose can leave families fighting a different kind of crisis – one measured not in deaths, but in years of care&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, shared with me her “conservative” but staggering estimate that half a million Americans each year risk brain damage from opioid-induced hypoxia, which is when the body is not receiving an adequate amount of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What effect these events have on people’s health, and how many are truly affected are burning questions. Volkow believes most injuries manifest in quiet but life-altering ways such as memory loss or diminished executive function. They can affect one’s ability to hold down a job, or fully participate in addiction recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Severe cases can drain patients of their life potential, according to Dr Jennifer Stevens, the director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Young people in particular can become “incredibly financially toxic to themselves and their loved ones” when they are not able to work or require long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, surviving an overdose can leave families fighting a different kind of crisis – one measured not in deaths, but in years of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An overdose occurs when opioids overwhelm receptors in the brain, leading to slower breathing and respiratory depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts believe brain injuries can occur after four or five minutes of inadequate respiration. The longer the brain and body go without sufficient oxygen, the worse injuries are likely to be – but outcomes remain a bit of a black box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec313148-8a53-46da-bf64-654523ab030a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Nurse Kenneth Emakpose, brushes JB’s teeth during his morning hygiene routine. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few years ago, Ashley Six-Workman, a nurse with West Virginia University’s Rockefeller &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neuroscience" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; Institute, found a woman who had overdosed and been down for at least a few minutes in a parking lot. She did not have Narcan, so when she began doing CPR and waiting for emergency medical services, she feared the worst: she thought she was going to have an anoxic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When the woman walked out of the hospital three days later, Six-Workman was both relieved and intrigued. “Clinically, in my head, it didn’t make sense,” she told me. “She should have some sort of impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data from a &lt;a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201701-022OC" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare study&lt;/a&gt; of overdose-related ICU admissions from 162 hospitals between 2009 and 2015 offers a sense of scale of the most extreme cases: of the 21,705 patients who required critical care, 8% suffered a catastrophic anoxic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But this data predates the opioid epidemic’s “third wave”, when fentanyl drove overdoses to unprecedented levels – so today’s numbers are almost certainly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because fentanyl crosses the blood-brain barrier so easily, it can trigger an overdose within minutes, leading to respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. “You have a faster onset and a narrower window to intervene,” said Erin Winstanley, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, naloxone has saved millions of lives: pharmacies sold 12.9m doses between October 2002 and September 2023. Yet each revived overdose also means another survivor left at risk of lasting complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also increasingly common for people to live through not just one, but multiple overdoses. Jon Zibbell, an epidemiologist who studies adverse health outcomes among people who inject and smoke street drugs, became concerned about the phenomenon as he witnessed people repeatedly overdosing on fentanyl and being revived by Narcan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a4447b38-4bd7-4cd7-97ed-f5bd1337a25d" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--immersive element-immersive dcr-imskkt"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tdqfl9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jessica wheels her son to attend a medical appointment at the Texas Institute of Rehabilitation and Recovery, better known as TIRR-Memorial Hermann, one of the US’s premier brain rehabilitation centers.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That survival is, on its face, a triumph of advocacy and harm-reduction policy. But Zibbell now worries about the cumulative toll. People he knew often felt “off-kilter” after a single overdose; what happens after a series of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hypothesizes that the repeated injuries may be somewhat analogous to what happens with a cluster of mini-strokes – or to football players who, after multiple minor concussions, develop chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a devastating neurodegenerative disease. But it is going unnoticed, he adds, because non-fatal overdoses are perceived as harmless, and because their effects are often not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his co-authors flagged the issue in a &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/non-fatal-opioid-overdose-associated-health-outcomes-final-summary-report-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;federal report&lt;/a&gt; on the health consequences of non-fatal overdoses back in 2019. “I believe it’s a silent epidemic of many non-fatal overdoses,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early research supports this theory, and suggests repeated non-fatal overdoses may lead to Alzheimer’s-like brain pathologies. Postmortem studies show elevated tau levels, the protein found at high levels in Alzheimer’s and CTE patients, while imaging of survivors reveals reduced hippocampal volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The problem has only grown more urgent as the drug supply has become increasingly toxic and unpredictable, said Zibbell. Today, Americans are not exposed to fentanyl alone, but instead are consuming a cocktail of lesser-known synthetic substances, and these contaminants can limit the effectiveness of Narcan and prolong downtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Recent CDC data appears to reflect his concern: between 2021 and 2023, ER visits for opioid overdoses &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/data-research/facts-stats/dose-dashboard-nonfatal-discharge-data.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, but related hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/data-research/facts-stats/dose-dashboard-nonfatal-discharge-data.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt; – suggesting patients now arrive in more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Zibbell, it marks a new phase in the opioid crisis: one that may be less likely to kill, but more likely to harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost from the moment Jessica arrived at the hospital after JB’s overdose, she sensed she and his medical team were on opposing sides. She was waiting for JB to wake up, she said, while they were waiting for JB to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica remembers doctors aggressively urging them to withdraw life support on the second day of his hospitalization. “We were being literally harassed for his organs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="de173704-07f6-42d8-be82-25657f4022a5" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr Cindy Ivanhoe, a professor of physical medicine at UTHealth Houston and director of the spasticity program and associated syndromes of movement at TIRR-Memorial Hermann, consults with Jessica Jarrett and her son, JB.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Meridith Kohut/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Compared to traumatic brain injuries, anoxic and hypoxic injuries caused by oxygen deficiency are barely studied, in part because outcomes have generally been considered very poor. (One neurologist, who wants to remain anonymous, told me that when his friend’s heart attack resulted in such an injury, his first impulse was “to put a pillow over his head”; that friend has fully recovered and remains alive decades later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When JB first opened his eyes five days in, the neurologist refused to watch Jessica’s video proof of it; it would not change his recommendation, he told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;JB then moved to a long-term acute care facility that specialized in neuro-rehabilitation. It should have been an ideal place for him, but he languished there, heavily medicated and unable to actively “participate” – as required by insurance companies – in therapy. As a result, staff withheld those activities, including the stretching of limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four months after his overdose, JB still had not been out of a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At one point, he dislocated his hip, an excruciating injury that went unnoticed until Jessica pinpointed its source through the rudimentary communication system she had worked out: he would stick out his tongue to signal “yes”, which he did when she pointed to his hip.

One day, he surprised them by suddenly mouthing the words of a favorite Bob Marley song playing in the background; on others, he would stare blankly into space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total, he spent 17 days in the ICU, the first seven in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts are &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.26619" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rethinking&lt;/a&gt; the conventional wisdom that patients who experience an anoxic event have little chance of recovery. The highly visible case of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest on the field in 2023, is one example, but broader statistics suggest better outcomes are possible, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11056133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;particularly for&lt;/a&gt; overdose survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Younger, healthier patients tend to do better, as do those who receive CPR quickly, and those who start rehabilitation soon after their injuries – but what sort of recovery a patient will make generally remains a mystery.

Doctors had hoped that switching to a J-tube, which bypasses the stomach, would ease his reflux. Instead, it brought more serious problems: repeated aspiration pneumonia, another trip to the ER and now, the decision to return to his original G-tube, which required surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica’s warmth filled the house. Amid boxes of medical supplies, a foil “happy birthday” banner hung above the mantle, next to a “PRAY4JB” license plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="116efd9e-af07-48fe-989c-a10f442794b0" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle chats at Kellyn’s Kafe with his mom, stepdad, and the cafe’s owner, Andrew Hannah.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jessica spoke to JB normally, and as we chatted in their living room, she got up every so often to adjust JB’s position, stretch his muscles and suction his throat. He expressed discomfort, but she could not figure out the source. (Later that afternoon, an occupational therapist stopped by. Using the movement of his shoulder to communicate with him – internal and external rotation for “yes” and “no” – she determined he was cold.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a hard life,” Jessica acknowledged in one of our conversations. “Would JB &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live like this? I hold a lot of guilt around that. I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, she sees their lives as far richer than the picture doctors initially presented to her. She is relentlessly positive and certain his recovery has more chapters to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the months since my visit, there has been evidence of that: JB’s health has stabilized, and he has begun to communicate more easily again by turning his head, and blinking and closing his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of effort, JB got approved for Medicaid in April, which means for the first time in four years, he now receives professional nursing support 24 hours a week. Jessica is hopeful JB will also start working with a speech therapist and that emerging technologies will help him communicate more fully soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At 34, Kyle lives with his mom and stepdad, Lauren and Matt McGinnis, in Salisbury, Maryland. On a quiet February afternoon, their tidy living room bore a framed sign: “It’s so good to be home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Little physical evidence of Kyle’s ordeal remains today, other than the scar left behind by his tracheostomy tube and the cane he uses to support his uneven gait. The residual cognitive and behavioral impact of his brain injury are harder to parse. Aside from his lost overdose memories, Kyle believes he is back to his old self: “My brain was injured, that has no bearing on me now,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His parents seemed accustomed to this disagreement, which they navigated gently in my presence. “I love you to death, buddy,” Matt prefaced before pointing to changes they have observed, such as Kyle’s trouble focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They reminded him of a conversation with his neurologist several years ago. Pointing to a cluster of dark spots on a scan of Kyle’s brain, she had compared it to a 70-year-old’s. Those damaged areas would not heal, but to give his brain the best shot at forming new pathways, she told him, he needed to embrace a life of routine and order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For a time, Kyle followed through. He enrolled in the local community college, working toward an associate’s degree in counseling. He made the dean’s list, and even drafted a business plan for a rehab center he wanted to name after his dad, who had died of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just before finishing the program, he quit, thinking it was a waste to spend money just to get a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He tried jobs at call centers, which he did not care for, and in 2023, became certified as a life insurance broker, though he is not working as one as he sees a driver’s license as necessary for the job. (His was revoked a few years ago when Kyle was stopped for driving under the influence, an incident Kyle blames on his friend who refused to let him stay on his couch after a couple beers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I visited, Kyle was spending his days in his bedroom trading crypto and aggressively pursuing the reinstatement of his driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His actions may be hard to understand, but they reflect common struggles for brain injury patients, who can experience lower self-awareness and heightened impulsivity and risk-taking. Traumatic brain injury is linked to substance abuse – it is both a risk factor and can make addiction harder to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kyle’s biggest setback came in 2018 when, two years into his remarkable recovery, he overdosed on fentanyl again. In an account his parents find dubious, he insists he found a bag of cocaine in the front yard and could not resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whatever the case, his stepfather and paramedics used four doses of Narcan to revive him. After a week in the hospital, his family and their pastor – a recovering addict himself – staged an intervention and sent Kyle to Hazelden Betty Ford, the addiction rehabilitation clinic in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2c302ac-132c-4588-9dd9-601ae624986e" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kyle tries to walk a couple miles every day on the treadmill in his family’s basement.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It did not go well – “I wasn’t having it,” Kyle told me. After a couple weeks, the center released him to a homeless shelter in Minneapolis. Kyle spent the next five months there, attending addiction counseling during the day and sleeping in the shelter at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After leaving in spring 2019, he stayed sober. His parents marvel both at the humane design of the city’s shelter system and at Kyle’s ability to thrive in it. “He did it on his own, with a brain injury and a cane,” Matt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I visited earlier this year, Kyle insisted he would never touch drugs again. “My life is shit,” he told me – not as a complaint, but as a reason not to make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not an easy path, though: as this story was going to press, Kyle was preparing to go to Florida for mental health counseling and a change of environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hopes he will also get physical rehabilitation there. He is determined to walk completely unassisted one day and wants to move into his own place, get his driver’s license back, and sell life insurance or work in finance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Not that he plans to forget his past. When he gets questions about his cane, he gives it to them straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A tiny chip implanted into the eyes of people suffering vision loss from irreversible age-related macular degeneration has restored central sight in a dazzling first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called the PRIMA system, tested across 17 European hospitals, and it restored central vision in 26 of 32 patients who used it for 12 months – many of whom could even read again. The result, developed by a large international team of doctors and scientists over many years, represents a massive breakthrough in treatments for vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the first time that any attempt at vision restoration has achieved such results in a large number of patients," &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/news/retinal-implant-restores-central-vision-patients-age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;says ophthamologist José-Alain Sahel&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, co-senior author on a paper describing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More than 80 percent of the patients were able to read letters and words, and some of them are reading pages in a book. This is really something we couldn't have dreamt of when we started on this journey, together with Daniel Palanker, 15 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2023.29.5-a.s2"&gt;Geographic vision loss&lt;/a&gt; from age-related macular degeneration is a progressive and irreversible condition that affects millions of people around the world. The macula, which is responsible for high-resolution central vision, resides within the retina at the back of the eye. As this part of the retina trophies, patches of blindness develop in a person's central vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy retina, photoreceptor cells convert light into electrical signals that are processed in the inner retina and sent to the brain. For people with geographic atrophy, these photoreceptor cells die off, which means that part of the eye is not receiving light signals, creating a blind spot in the center of their vision, while peripheral vision is less affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMcp2102061"&gt;not everyone&lt;/a&gt; with age-related macular degeneration will experience geographic atrophy, for the millions that do, it can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIMA, the brainchild of ophthalmologist Daniel Palanker of Stanford University, co-senior author of the research paper led by ophthalmologist Frank Holz of the University of Bonn in Germany, could be poised to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system consists of two parts. The implant is a tiny wireless silicon sensor, just two by two millimeters in area and less than the width of a hair in thickness, and containing 378 photovoltaic pixels. It's slipped in behind the retina where the cellular atrophy is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178326" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-178326" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/implantation-600x411.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178326" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The eye of a patient before and after implantation of the photovoltaic array. (Holz et al, &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part of PRIMA is a pair of glasses connected to a pocket processor. The glasses capture images and convert them into near-infrared light near the 880-nanometer wavelength before sending them to the implant. The wavelength is important: near-infrared light is &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/"&gt;invisible to the human eye&lt;/a&gt;, so it will not be perceived by the healthy retinal photoreceptors or interfere with the patient's remaining peripheral vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant, in turn, converts the infrared signals into electrical signals and sends them to the brain to be perceived, similar to how the natural eye converts and transmits data. And because the implant is powered by light, it doesn't need an external power source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extensive clinical testing and a small, five-participant  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178320" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers were ready for the next step. They recruited 38 patients in 17 hospitals across five European countries to test the system for 12 months; six of those patients were unavailable for follow-up at the end of the trial period, so the results are based on the remaining 32 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean age of the patients was 79, and all were experiencing vision loss from geographic atrophy. Their vision was tested before undergoing the trial, and again at several points during the trial. Initially, the patients had to spend several months learning how to use PRIMA, including the functions of the system, such as zooming in on text, and interpreting the electrical patterns as visual shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients – 26, or 81 percent – experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision, with some patients even reaching vision close to 20/420, the resolution limit of the PRIMA system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178327" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178327" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-178327" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/simulation-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178327" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Simulations of a macular degeneration patient's vision before (left) and after (right) implantation of the PRIMA system.

I was nervous, excited, all those things. There was no pain during the operation, but you're still aware of what's happening. It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter.

ingredients and additives typical to UPFs, such as emulsifiers may also play a role.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers followed 33,654 middle-age participants who completed an online dietary questionnaire and blood tests around eight years before having a brain scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.1" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/10/10/health_newsletter.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Additive-laden foods such as crisps and sweets have been vilified for decades over their supposed risks, with dozens of studies linking them to type 2 diabetes and other diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The questionnaire involved a 24-hour dietary recall consisting of over 200 food items in which participants had to indicate how many portions of each food item they had consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then estimated energy consumption for each item, excluding any participants who reported consuming extreme amounts of calories—defined as anything less than 500 kcal and more than 5000 kcal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, the recommended daily calorie intake is around 2,500 kcal for men and 2,000 kcal for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants consumed around 2,608 kcal a day—just over 46 per cent of which came from ultra processed foods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods were then split into four categories using the NOVA system: unprocessed or minimally processed, processed ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that higher ultraprocessed food consumption was associated with brain changes in areas involved in hunger and reward circuits, suggesting that ultraprocessed foods exert effects on the brain beyond just contributing to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hypothalamus—responsible for regulating hunger among other things—eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with lower mean diffusivity, indicating increased cell density and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This inflammation can disrupt how the brain regulates hunger, satiety and reward—all of which are central to food addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the brain's regulation of hunger is impaired, and its reward circuits are overstimulated, people may crave more of these foods despite being full, and lose control over how much they eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that damage to this brain circuit, involved in food liking and cravings, 'may favour maladaptive eating, like more ultra processed foods, and metabolic disease, further perpetuating a vicious cycle.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In brain regions involved in rewards and motivation, however—like the nucleus accumbens and pallidum—eating more ultraprocessed foods was associated with signs of reduced cell density and increased water content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, these changes could reflect early signs of cognitive decline, brain shrinkage and cell loss—which could weaken self-control around food and reinforce compulsive eating habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'Eating ultraprocessed foods increases several nutrient and metabolic markers of disease and is associated with structural brain changes in areas that regulate eating behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings provide insight into how ultraprocessed foods consumption may perpetuate itself while contributing to adverse health effects.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14690703/handful-day-risk-cancer-heart-attack-study-ultra-processed-food.html"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;earlier this year found that consuming just an extra 100g of UPFs each day—roughly two packets of crisps—raised the risk of life-threatening heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers assessed 41 studies spanning North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania involving 8,286,940 adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found each additional 100g per day of UPF consumption was associated with a 5.9 per cent increased risk of cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Asia 2025 conference in Singapore, also showed adults had a 14.5 per cent higher risk of high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella term UPFs is used to cover anything edible made with colourings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready-meals, ice cream and tomato ketchup are some of the best-loved examples of products that fall under the umbrella UPF term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK is the worst in Europe for eating UPFs, which make up an estimated 57 per cent of the national diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:52:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNM3d1VDJILWtCWHdhSW9CMnhCNzBSRWdnbHpIQnJnd1ZZU3lqWjhWQS16MW5mNzltSXhPWF8wWkJWZ3ppSFBiUnZQdVpBQ3Q5SUd3cXU4dTM5R2t1eHFybUpMdEZyeUJ4Q0RqWlFUdTdVSU5BTmVndVlRaldHSW91d0dlTS0xMWJTNlYxczdYQmZfUjUta05sNXlRT2d3SThOWjFF</guid></item><item><title>这种健康综合症影响几乎所有美国人。那你为什么没听说过呢？ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-health-syndrome-affects-nearly-all-americans-so-why-havent-you-heard-of-it-2000674346</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chances are, you’re probably in the dark about a health problem that affects nearly every adult in America. A new survey shows that almost 90% of Americans have never heard of the recently defined syndrome known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic, or CKM, syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll conducted the online survey in August on behalf of the American Heart Association. Based on responses from more than 4,000 people, the survey found that only 12% were previously aware of CKM syndrome. The findings suggest that few people are on the lookout for this condition, despite the vast majority of Americans having some form of it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We want people to know that it’s really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time,” said Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association’s chief medical officer for prevention, in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Interconnected organs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AHA &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X23000282"&gt;coined&lt;/a&gt; the term “CKM syndrome” in October 2023. The label is meant to reflect the reality that our kidneys and heart depend heavily on each other, and that both in turn are heavily affected by our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It broadly combines four other conditions and their associated risk factors: heart disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, all of which can be connected to the others. Someone living with obesity, for instance, is more likely to develop the other three conditions. CKM is further broken down into four stages, depending on the level of risk factors or related diseases a person has. Someone with stage 1 CKM, for example, has no apparent symptoms but does have excess body fat, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Past research has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818457"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that about 90% of Americans meet the criteria for CKM syndrome, with about 50% in stage 2. Many people also have risk factors that can make them vulnerable to all of the diseases under the umbrella of CKM, such as hypertension, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;In the dark, but willing to learn more&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to most not knowing about CKM, 68% of respondents in the survey wrongly believed that it’s best to take care of these conditions separately or weren’t sure about how to manage them. About 42% also incorrectly believed that a healthy heart couldn’t be affected by other organs or weren’t sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way,” Sanchez said. “These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the bright side, though most Americans might be unaware about the existence of CKM, plenty in the AHA survey were curious once they were told about it. Over two-thirds felt it was important to learn more about the syndrome or their overall CKM health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AHA has just launched a public health campaign on CKM, which includes a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome"&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbHwmhWthzM"&gt;short YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;. Early next year, the organization will also release the first formal guidelines on the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

It occurs when the heart cannot pump blood efficiently, meaning the body does not get enough oxygen and nutrients. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, a cardiologist specialising in heart failure and heart transplantation, explains that recognising the signs early can save lives. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent fatigue, swelling in the legs or feet, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and a constant cough or wheezing. People at higher risk include those with high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, smokers, and those who consume excessive alcohol. Preventive measures such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet low in salt, avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol, and managing stress can reduce the risk and help protect heart health. Early consultation with a doctor is vital for better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding heart failure and its impact on the body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure doesn't imply that the heart has ceased to function. Rather, it implies that the heart isn't pumping blood as it should to satisfy the body's demands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood delivers oxygen and nourishment to organs and tissues, and when the heart can no longer pump efficiently, the body can't operate at optimal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov points out that heart failure is far more prevalent than most individuals realize. Approximately one in five individuals will eventually develop heart failure sometime in their lifetime. In the United States alone, more than six million individuals have this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure can build up over time or come on suddenly and can be mild to severe. Although it is a chronic illness, with good treatment, individuals can lead longer lives with a good quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which lifestyle change do you think is most effective in preventing heart failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why early detection and treatment are crucial for heart failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov likens heart failure to some forms of cancer due to its urgency. Unless treated properly, figures show that one out of two individuals who are diagnosed with heart failure can not live for more than five years. This indicates the need for early detection of signs and early visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the right treatment, lifestyle changes, and follow-up visits, the prognosis can be quite favorable. Those with heart failure can live longer if they stick to medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of heart failure &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompt identification of signs of heart failure can help a lot. Dr Yaranov recommends that individuals watch out for the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath when exercising or on lying down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-standing fatigue or tiredness that is not relieved by rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leg, ankle, or foot swelling due to fluid accumulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased or irregular heart rate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic cough or wheezing that persists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms happen because the heart is not pumping enough blood. If you experience one or more of these signs, it is necessary to see a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at risk of developing heart failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anyone can get heart failure, there are some factors that make it more likely. These are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure, which makes the heart pump harder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease, which slows the flow of blood to the heart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes, which damages the heart and blood vessels over time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity, which adds extra workload on the heart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking, which harms the heart and blood vessels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive use of alcohol, which may cause the heart muscle to weaken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising these risk factors can allow individuals to take preventive measures against heart failure or catch it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A healthy heart: Prevention tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not all heart failure can be avoided, some lifestyle measures can lower the risk and ensure cardiovascular health. Dr Yaranov advises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a healthy weight through proper diet and regular exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular exercise, both aerobic and strengthening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following a low-salt diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abstaining from tobacco and reducing alcohol intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping stress under control by using relaxation methods, being mindful, or seeking counselling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These choices in lifestyle will assist the heart in functioning better and lower the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a doctor&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis is essential in treating heart failure. If you or your loved one is suffering from sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, or swelling in legs and feet, it is necessary to visit a doctor at once. Early intervention can enhance results and enable individuals to live a good quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov stresses that individuals need to question, know their risk, and act proactively to safeguard their heart.

			&lt;p&gt;New evidence confirms a long-held theory that people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="178283" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; hear 'voices' in their heads by misattributing inner speech as external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This idea's been around for 50 years, but it's been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Thomas Whitford, a psychology researcher at the University of New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt;) to measure brainwaves, Whitford and his colleagues tested the way that the brain reacts to inner speech, and, in people with schizophrenia, the way their brains react to auditory hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-signal-disruptions-behind-voices-in-schizophrenia"&gt;Scientists Identify Brain Signal Disruptions Behind Voices in Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we speak – even just in our heads – the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active," Whitford &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants included 55 people with schizophrenia and recent auditory hallucinations, 44 people with schizophrenia but no recent auditory hallucinations, and 43 people with no history of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort was asked to listen to audio over headphones and to say either 'bah' or 'bih' in their minds at the same time that they heard a sound played. This sound was also either 'bah' or 'bih', but participants did not know if their choice of internally voiced word would match what they heard in their headphones.&lt;br&gt;
When the inner speech matched the external sound, the brains of the participants who had experienced recent auditory hallucinations reacted far more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud," Whitford &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. "But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn't happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it's coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the 'voices' people with schizophrenia hear are their own inner speech, which their brain wrongly perceives as external. These findings may help doctors identify who is at risk of psychosis even before it occurs, which could allow for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaf167"&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="a4a1138b-f1d2-4c4d-bcd6-a75d76b56a82"&gt;How often do you notice your shoulders creeping up toward your ears? I have to consciously remind myself to exhale, drop my shoulders and straighten my spine several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the more stressed I am, the higher my shoulders seem to rise, until I’m sitting hunched at my desk like a chilly, puffed-up bird, wondering why my neck feels sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="a4a1138b-f1d2-4c4d-bcd6-a75d76b56a82-2"&gt;All that tension has to go somewhere, and for many of us, the neck seems to bear most of the strain. Yoga can be a powerful way to counteract stress and ease discomfort as it works on a physical and mental level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yogawithveronique.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://yogawithveronique.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Veronique Ory&lt;/a&gt;, a yoga instructor who has been guiding students for over a decade through her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yogawithveronique.com/membership/" target="_blank" data-url="https://yogawithveronique.com/membership/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Shine &lt;/a&gt;platform and retreats, explains to &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;why neck pain is a common issue and how yoga can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neck pain often arises from a combination of posture, stress and lifestyle. In our increasingly sedentary world, our shoulders tend to round forward, and the head drifts ahead of the spine,” says Ory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many forms of neck discomfort stem from modern habits, such as long hours at a computer, driving or looking down at a phone—all of which pull your head forward. Yoga can help retrain this alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ory explains that this head-forward posture can eventually cause chronic strain in the upper back, neck and even jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zxCS7RFsjeYgmcujxt4AhX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zxCS7RFsjeYgmcujxt4AhX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even subtle habits like clenching the teeth, shallow breathing or carrying emotional tension can contribute,” says Ory. “Gentle yoga practices that focus on awareness and release can help restore balance, poise and energy flow through the upper body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ory has chosen three gentle postures designed to bring awareness and balance into your body and breath, without exacerbating pain. She’s also incorporated extra support, so have a block, cushion and yoga strap ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-supported-savasana" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-supported-savasana"&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1.

    &lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don’t advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the guidelines say help (and don’t help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75 clinical trials to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers produced 59 recommendations. However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1.5g a day for at least four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this just isn’t realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet –  where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn’t help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we now know it’s not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

According to Dr Sudhir Kumar, the real game-changer for your health might just be something you can do right beside your chair — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/squats" target="_blank"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Turns out, taking short &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/exercise" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; breaks during the day can do far more for your heart and blood sugar than one long workout after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sudhir Kumar, a renowned neurologist, recently shared on X that just 10 squats every 45 minutes are more effective in controlling &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/blood-sugar-levels" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; than a single 30-minute walk, especially for those who sit for long hours. He explained that prolonged sitting — whether at your desk or while binge-watching — increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124633975" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that even brief bursts of movement can help undo the damage caused by sitting too long. Short activities like squats or three-minute walks every 45 minutes keep your body active and metabolism in check — something a once-a-day workout doesn’t fully achieve. So, the next time your smartwatch nudges you to “stand up,” maybe throw in a quick round of squats. Your body will thank you more than that post-dinner stroll ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, squats are a fundamental movement that engages multiple muscles and joints, making them one of the most effective exercises for overall strength and mobility. Squats primarily target the lower body — glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors, and calves — while also activating core muscles like the rectus abdominis, obliques, and erector spinae. Advanced variations, such as back or overhead squats, even involve shoulders, arms, and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-grx-impression="Article Recommendations - Edit#articleshow_inline_impression#magazines/panache/forget-long-walks-apollo-neurologist-suggests-one-simple-exercise-you-can-do-at-home-that-can-protect-your-heart-and-sugar-levels | " class="ar_wrp arwd_ld_chk font_mon clr hide custom_ad"&gt;&lt;div class="ar_survey hide"&gt;&lt;p class="ar_back_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="arb_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="ar_lt_arr"&gt;«&lt;/span&gt; Back to recommendation stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124633975" id="div-vdoai-mid-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squats strengthen your core, improve posture, reduce injury risk, and enhance lower-body strength, helping with daily movements like walking, climbing, or lifting.

"The various vascular pathologies have not been comprehensively defined, so we haven't known what we're treating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And we didn't know that nano- and microplastics were in the picture, because we couldn't see them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177516" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177516" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodVessels.jpg" alt="Blood vessel analysis" class="wp-image-177516 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodVessels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodVessels-600x384.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177516" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study looked at how vascular processes can lead to brain injuries. (Bearer, &lt;em&gt;Am. J.

These included the thickening of arteries and small amounts of bleeding, as well as tiny strokes that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;harm neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classifications are intended to be used in future studies of dementia, to explore how blood vessel damage may relate to disease. Every time we understand a condition more fully, that new knowledge can help in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-alzheimers-day-heres-how-far-weve-come-in-search-of-a-cure"&gt;development of treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177518" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodAnalysis.jpg" alt="Blood vessel under a microscope" class="wp-image-177518 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BloodAnalysis-600x510.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177518" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A blood vessel in the brain's subcortical white matter, with turquoise dots showing plastic particles.

Some of the identified pathologies in vascular dementia overlap with Alzheimer's, such as the presence of abnormal amyloid beta proteins. Further investigation into the relationship between both diseases could give insight into how different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-pee-could-predict-your-risk-of-one-kind-of-dementia"&gt;dementia get started&lt;/a&gt; and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny plastic fragments, which are everywhere in the environment, also seem to be getting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-infiltrating-your-brain-what-are-the-effects"&gt;into the brain&lt;/a&gt;. While it's not yet clear what the health impacts are, these pollutants could contribute to or be a product of damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nanoplastics in the brain represent a new player on the field of brain pathology," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/vascular-disease-is-an-overlooked-contributor-to-dementia-unm-researcher-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bearer. "All our current thinking about Alzheimer's disease and other dementias needs to be revised in light of this discovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.26.625277"&gt;I'm finding&lt;/a&gt; is that there's a lot more plastics in [people with dementia] than in normal subjects.

Dementia cases all &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-identified-four-distinct-types-of-alzheimer-s"&gt;have their differences&lt;/a&gt;, and digging deeper into those variations could teach us more about what makes some people more vulnerable to brain disease than others – and what can be done in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Describing the pathological changes in this comprehensive way is really new," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/vascular-disease-is-an-overlooked-contributor-to-dementia-unm-researcher-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2025.07.007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2015, guidance shifted around peanuts for high-risk kids and expanded two years later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; found that peanut allergy rates in children under the age of 3 dropped by roughly 43% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. Rates for all food allergies dropped by about 36%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I was surprised by was the magnitude of the results,” said Dr. David Hill, an attending allergist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and senior author of the study. Even being able to say that allergy rates plateaued “would be huge news, but the fact that we actually saw a reduction in the onset of new food allergy in kids under 3 is incredible.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues analyzed electronic health records from nearly 50 pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in about 120,000 children between 0 and 3. Fifteen months marks the peak onset of peanut allergy, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids were deemed newly allergic if they received a diagnosis code by a provider for a food allergy and were prescribed an EpiPen, Hill said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reductions in diagnoses were found even though only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit Food Allergy Research and Education, who was not involved in the study, hailed it for its focus on real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s clear that the practice of “eat early, eat often” for foods that can provoke allergic reactions works in a clinical setting, “it’s really important to know that in the real world, this can also decrease incidence and prevalence for the infant population,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person has a peanut allergy, their body responds to the proteins in peanuts as though they’re dangerous. The immune system tries to fight them off, triggering symptoms ranging from hives and diarrhea to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poblete said that the findings highlight the need to change policy to further drive down life-threatening allergy diagnoses. That could include the U.S. Department of Agriculture including peanut products in their infant food packages, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food allergy prevalence has been on the rise, with 2.2% of U.S. children having a peanut allergy, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072593/204627/Encouraging-Trends-in-Peanut-Allergy-Prevention" target="_blank"&gt;commentary on the new study&lt;/a&gt;. Besides delayed introduction of allergenic foods, other risk factors include cesarean section births and antibiotic exposure, according to Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just a call to double down our efforts to understand why it is that children develop food allergies and how we can better treat and ultimately cure these diseases,” Hill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the period the researchers studied, children’s food guidelines have expanded further. In 2021, the Academy of Pediatrics recommended introducing major food allergens, including peanuts and eggs, to all infants between 4 and 6  months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 23:28:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5xbDZCUkNfV2l1OTRBckhEeHVaY3JXQnhsZ0g4aDItOXpaUENUYzFMSG1Na3dlYVl6OTc0YkRQV21NN0FSVDBqNVA1YmVLZFFLeFlud01xT3lkMV9zRVFJY1cyQnA0V0VUTVc5bDJobk1QS1JZRDJJOQ</guid></item><item><title>研究警告称，削减抗疟疾资金可能导致“有史以来最致命的复苏” --《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/21/global-health-infectious-disease-aid-cuts-malaria-funding-cost-deaths-gdp-africa</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Slashed contributions from wealthy countries to an anti-malaria fund could allow a resurgence of the disease, costing millions of lives and billions of pounds by the end of the decade, according to a new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The fight against malaria faces new threats, including extreme weather and humanitarian crises increasing the number of people exposed, and growing biological resistance to insecticides and drugs, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gareth Jenkins, of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaria" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; No More UK, said: “Cutting funding risks the deadliest resurgence we’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Analysts said the cost to sub-Saharan &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; would be substantial, and the region’s leaders have appealed to the G7 to maintain investment.

The fund provides &lt;a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/malaria/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 60% of all international financing for malaria&lt;/a&gt; controls, such as mosquito nets and preventive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If funding was 20% lower than in the last round, researchers said there would be an additional 33 million cases and 82,000 deaths, and $5.14bn (£3.83bn) in lost GDP by 2030, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, funding cuts look likely. Germany &lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/germany-commits-1b-to-global-fund-as-aid-cuts-shape-world-health-summit-111081" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pledged $1bn &lt;/a&gt;to the fund last week, a figure &lt;a href="https://globalfundadvocatesnetwork.org/gfan-2025-pledge-tracker/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;23% lower&lt;/a&gt; than its last promise. The UK government is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/proposed-uk-cuts-global-aid-fund-preventable-deaths-charities" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly looking at a figure 20% down&lt;/a&gt; on its previous commitment, although it says no final decision has been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a funding vacuum led to preventive malaria control collapsing entirely, the report estimates there would be 525 million more cases, 990,000 more deaths and $83bn in lost GDP. About 750,000 of those deaths would be of children under five, representing “the loss of a generation to malaria”, the report’s authors warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c4e62d95-7a45-4fb0-a60e-e334aee6e920" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Proposed UK cuts to global aid fund could lead to 300,000 preventable deaths, say charities","elementId":"c4e62d95-7a45-4fb0-a60e-e334aee6e920","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/proposed-uk-cuts-global-aid-fund-preventable-deaths-charities"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Conversely, they said that if the Global Fund received the &lt;a href="https://globalfundadvocatesnetwork.org/gfan-2025-pledge-tracker/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;full $18bn&lt;/a&gt; it was asking for, there would be a $230bn boost to GDP, 865 million fewer cases and 1.86 million fewer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Phumaphi said there had been “marked increases in [domestic] budget allocation not just to health, but specifically to malaria, particularly since the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she added: “I think we need to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and exactly how much is required in funding in order for countries to be able to catch up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;African countries heavily burdened by servicing debt and the economic aftershocks of Covid-19 were facing not only infectious diseases but also a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was worrying, Phumaphi said, that donor countries were considering pledging less than in the last round, “but we are grateful that countries like Germany have pledged substantial amounts – a billion is quite a substantial amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1e12a2b9-bc82-4a4a-b8bd-7f407d0b3617" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Rising biological resistance to insecticides and anti-malarial drugs is one of the challenges faced by the fight to eradicate the disease.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Desire Danga Essigue/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former Botswana health minister said she was hopeful that wealthy individuals, the private sector and foundations would step up “because when we talk about productivity, jobs [and the] economic potential that Africa tends to lose, we are talking about potential investments and markets for the private sector”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of those individuals, the Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote, encouraged others to join him in filling the funding gap: “Malaria is not just a health crisis; it is an $83bn brake on Africa’s growth and enterprise.

&lt;p&gt;Highmark will start covering Noom — a subscription-based app that claims to enable weight loss by harnessing psychological research — at no cost for nearly 2 million members next year.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health insurer announced the partnership Monday, touting it as a way for members to make lasting changes to their eating and exercise habits.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 74% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, costing the health care system $173 billion a year and presenting “one of the nation’s most urgent health challenges,” according to Highmark.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom resists the “diet” label, though it does rely on a color-coded food tracking system to steer users toward healthier options. It also incorporates daily lessons, quizzes and activities.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CEO Geoff Cook recently put it to news outlet &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1990200/what-is-noom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, Noom wants to rely on gamified, daily engagement to become the “Duolingo of health.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year-long subscription to Noom’s weight-loss plan costs $209.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highmark will fully cover Noom for members not on a Medicare Advantage Plan who have a body mass index of 25 or greater. The subscription is merely discounted below that threshold.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that people can better manage their weight or diabetes to avoid dangerous — and expensive — complications like heart disease, said Tracy Saula, chief product and experience officer at Highmark Health.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of money in the health care industry is spent on treating those diseases, but not nearly enough money in the industry is spent on saying, ‘how do we prevent those diseases?’ ” Saula said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cody Fair, Noom’s chief commercial officer, said Highmark members will be able to access “AI-powered tools like body scan technology” and “smart food logging.” Some features available to members aren’t included in the version of the app available to the general public.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer will send out enrollment instructions closer to the program’s start.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, members must go through an initial assessment to determine which tier of the program is best for them. Some focus just on weight loss, while others include diabetes management or advice specific to people on GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Noom app first launched in 2016 but didn’t achieve widespread popularity until the covid pandemic. As it gained users — eclipsing 45 million worldwide by 2021 — the app also amassed critics.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Baker, vice president of health strategy and delivery at Highmark Health, said she’s aware of common concerns, including that Noom’s psychological tips could lead to eating disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are protocols in place to prevent this, according to Baker, including an initial assessment that looks at a person’s relationship with food.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone is displaying eating disorder indicators, they are not enrolled in one of the programs, they are actually referred back to Highmark,” she said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Highmark might recommend the patient talk to a clinician or case manager to decide whether Noom is appropriate for them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom says it has authored more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles supporting its methods. Still, some users and experts say Noom’s marketing underplays the degree to which it’s a traditional diet.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York City-based company also provides GLP-1 drugs, including through a “microdose program” that’s meant to address affordability challenges.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highmark, whose &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/highmark-study-surgery-beats-drugs-like-ozempic-for-those-looking-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers recently found&lt;/a&gt; weight-loss surgery often beats GLP-1 drugs on both cost and effectiveness, is not entrusting Noom with prescribing these medications.

&lt;/p&gt;

During pregnancy and postpartum, the human breast significantly remodels itself to create a supply of nutritious milk to help a baby’s organs, brain and bones to grow. After weaning, the breast goes through a process called involution, changing back. During this process, new cells are created and older, damaged cells are cleared out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological redesign is also “a main trigger” for the recruitment of specialized immune cells to the breast, called CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, says study co-author Sherene Loi. Other immune challenges, including milk proteins, any foreign material coming from the baby, mastitis and viruses, also bring T cells to the breast tissue, says Loi, a medical oncologist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;T-cell count&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loi and her colleagues’ research had three parts. First, they looked at a diverse population of 260 healthy women who had undergone preventative mastectomies or breast reductions — some of whom had a normal risk of breast cancer, others an elevated risk — and compared the T-cell count in the removed breast tissue of women with and without children. Women who had had children had more T cells and those cells were long-lived, persisting for up to 50 years after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the authors used mouse models to determine whether pregnancy and breastfeeding protect against breast cancer. Mice that had never had pups, mice that had pups that were almost immediately removed, forcing weaning and mice that had gone through a full cycle of lactation and involution had cancer cells introduced into a mammary fat pad. Loi and colleagues found that the tumours were smaller in the mice that had lactated, and that these animals also had more T cells in the tumours, than the mice that had their pups removed, forcing weaning. “Immunity was both in the breast and systemic. So lactation does actually change the whole body’s immunity in these mice models,” says Loi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, the team looked at a population of more than 1,000 women who had what is known as triple-negative breast cancer, which occurs most commonly in women under the age of 40 and is one of the most aggressive forms of the disease. All of the women had given birth. Those who had breastfed had better survival rates — and their tumours contained more T cells — than did those who hadn’t breastfed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Ransohoff, an oncologist who treats and researches breast cancer at Stanford University in California, says the study leverages a creative set of data from mice and humans to show that breastfeeding and involution result in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell-driven antitumour immunity in breast tissue. The study also finds that these T cells are associated with triple-negative breast tumour regression. In people, some of these immune cells are retained for decades after a baby’s delivery, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;An adult traveled through the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) with measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/about-king-county/about-public-health/news/news-archive-2025/10-17-measles-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult, a resident of Arizona, traveled from an area with an active measles outbreak and was not vaccinated, officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was at SEA&lt;/a&gt; on October 13 from 11:30 a.m. to 2:40 p.m. in the C Concourse at Gate C9, the Green Train Line, and the N Concourse at Gate N5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials noted the person traveled before they discovered they were infected and before any rash appeared, but the virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Those exposed to measles at SEA would become sick Oct. 20 to Nov. 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those exposed at the airport and not immune to measles would become sick between October 20 and November 3, while immunocompromised people may take longer to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes,” Public Health – Seattle and King County stated on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one person gets sick, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby can become infected if unprotected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin seven to 21 days after exposure, and the disease is contagious from around four days before the rash appears to about four days after.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death,” officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fast food often gets a bad reputation, but surprisingly it can fit into a healthy lifestyle with a little bit of planning and mindfulness. During busy days, sometimes fast food, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfasts-at-chick-fil-a-8751741" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chick-fil-A, may be the most convenient&lt;/a&gt; and realistic choice. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/my-favorite-high-protein-chick-fil-a-salad-11741327" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chick-fil-A is one of the most popular fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. They’re known for their crispy chicken and signature sauces, but they also have several menu options that can fit more easily into a balanced diet. After speaking with a few registered dietitians, one menu item that stood out was the Market Salad with Grilled Chicken Nuggets. Let’s explore why this menu choice ranks supreme on their list and get expert tips for ordering at Chick-fil-A.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://www.blissfulnutrition365.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Ambrazia Sublett, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, “The Market Salad is a great choice because it’s a burst of colors with green from the salad greens, blueberries, apples and strawberries all providing phytonutrients that our body needs. The fruit addition to the salad not only adds color but flavor.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad is made with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035429/is-salad-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mixed greens&lt;/a&gt;, topped with a blend of blue cheese crumbles, strawberries, blueberries, red and green apples, and topped with your choice of protein, such as grilled chicken nuggets. It also comes with a packet of Harvest Nut Granola and Roasted Almonds for crunch. Here are a few more reasons why dietitians often recommend this salad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding a serving of grilled chicken nuggets to the Chick-fil-A Market Salad adds a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-proteins-to-help-you-lose-weight-11770165" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of lean protein&lt;/a&gt; that supports muscle maintenance, satiety and overall energy balance. The amount of protein your body needs depends on several factors including gender, age, activity level and current health status. According to the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, adults should consume approximately 10% to 35% of their daily calories from protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad, with the addition of grilled chicken, contributes significantly to this recommended amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad is one of the few fast-food options that incorporate a variety of fruits and veggies, including berries, apples and leafy greens. These nutrient-dense foods are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in vitamin C, vitamin A and phytonutrients&lt;/a&gt;. Phytonutrients are bioactive compounds found in plants that are responsible for their vibrant hues and flavors. They also help to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fight inflammation and support immune health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike some fast-food salads that provide a small amount of protein or a large amount of fried toppings, this salad provides a healthy balance. It offers protein, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complex carbs from fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-heart-health-8604884" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy fats from nuts&lt;/a&gt;, and fiber from vegetables, all of which help to provide a steady source of energy. This nutritious combo also helps to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17387/5-tips-to-keep-your-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;, reducing energy crashes later in the day. Sublett recommends choosing a vinaigrette for a light dressing that won’t weigh down the salad flavors.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few dietitian-approved strategies to make your Chick-fil-A meal more balanced without sacrificing taste:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Try pairing your meal with water or unsweetened iced tea instead of soda to cut back on added sugar and empty calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Grilled over Fried:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sproutsnutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sarah Sullivan, M.S., RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt; recommends choosing grilled options, which are lower in fat and calories than fried ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the Dressings and Sauces:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bettrfull.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Randazzo, M.A., RDN, CDCES,&lt;/a&gt; says to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-healthiest-salad-dressing-8684702" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;pay close attention to the sauces and dressings&lt;/a&gt;, as they may be higher in sodium and added sugar. “Skip the creamy dressings and opt for lighter sauces such as BBQ (45 [calories]), Zesty Buffalo (25), Sweet + Spicy Sriracha (45), or Honey Mustard (50),” adds Randazzo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Your Meal:&lt;/strong&gt; “Pairing a grilled entree with nutrient-rich sides like the kale salad or fruit cup can help you enjoy a meal that’s both delicious and supportive of your health goals,” says&lt;a href="https://nourishfamily.com/about/brooke/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brooke Miller, M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Mindful of Portion Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Some items, like milkshakes or waffle fries, are best enjoyed occasionally in smaller portions. Try sharing with a friend or ordering a kid’s size for a simple way to practice moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to choosing a healthier fast-food option, variety and balance matter. The Chick-fil-A Market Salad with Grilled Chicken Nuggets is a great choice because it provides a source of lean protein, antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, and healthy fats, all in one. With a few mindful ordering strategies, you can enjoy a meal that nourishes your body while still fitting into your lifestyle. And the best part? You don’t have to sacrifice flavor or satisfaction to make a choice that supports your health goals.&lt;br&gt;

All three were hospitalized and are now recovering, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;California department of public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mpox is a viral infection that often begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills and muscle aches. These are usually followed by a rash that starts as small raised spots, then develop into fluid-filled blisters before forming scabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus has two main genetic groups, or “clades”. Clade I mpox has caused widespread disease and deaths in parts of central and east Africa, most acutely in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clade II was the strain behind the 2022 US outbreak, which has circulated at low levels since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The presence of clade I needs careful evaluation,” said Seth Blumberg, an associate professor of medicine at the University of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco’s division of infectious diseases and hospital medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t think the historical results we’ve seen from Africa are directly translatable, but we need to monitor these cases closely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Rita Nguyen, assistant state public health officer, said in Friday’s statement that “clade I mpox cases can be severe” and the “risk of severe disease and hospitalization are highest for people with weakened immune systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s critical to protect yourself by getting both doses of the mpox vaccine if you or your sex partner(s) may be at risk for mpox,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anyone can contract mpox through close physical contact, including sex. Past outbreaks of clade II &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;primarily affected&lt;/a&gt; gay and bisexual men and transgender or non-binary people who have sex with men. California’s public health department now believes person-to-person spread of clade I is occurring in California, mainly affecting these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Long Beach, officials &lt;a href="https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-of-long-beach-confirms-first-case-of-clade-i-mpox/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced the first case&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;six prior US clade I cases&lt;/a&gt;, all linked to travel abroad. The first was detected in San Mateo county in 2024. Officials said the overall risk to the public remains low, and casual contact in settings like offices or public transit is unlikely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Jynneos vaccine protects against both clade I and II mpox. It is a two-dose series given a month apart, with full immunity reached two weeks after the second dose. No booster is currently recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of contracting mpox, but experts say it helps reduce severity if a person were to contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The vaccines are completely protective,” Blumberg said. “Vaccines can prevent the severity of disease. If you were to get mpox, you would be less likely to need advanced care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it is not known how long vaccine protection might last, or if protection might decrease over time, according to its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The public health agency is analyzing the current data and conducting studies to better understand how the Jynneos vaccine works amid the current mpox outbreak, as well as how long protection might last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOWUJnS0N0RFJiUWd5UWUwWlY0a2FKeV9OUFhfRDZqdVloa0sxVlJsdThNcGNQWnV3eWYtUGR0TzdNRndjVzFObDdnb0RxcmZpemx6bGFCTWpZTXNVM0NLYzdiTm1yZExta1JHTVVheElBbkVpaDQ4WF9MWTNlYVBvdl8xcG5MOHdyMGc</guid></item><item><title>肠道细菌产生的血清素为新型IBS治疗提供了希望- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-serotonin-gut-bacteria-ibs-treatment.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, clarifies the complex interaction between gut bacteria and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Experiments demonstrate that gut bacteria can produce the important substance serotonin. The finding may lead to future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;IBS is a common gastrointestinal disorder, more common in women, with symptoms such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/abdominal+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;abdominal pain&lt;/a&gt;, constipation or diarrhea. The cause of the disease is not clear, but the intestinal environment, including the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; and serotonin, appear to be important factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is best known as a neurotransmitter in the brain, but over 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, where it controls bowel movements via the enteric nervous system, sometimes called the "gut–brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that the bacteria in the gut, the gut microbiota, affect how much serotonin is produced by the host, but until now it has been unclear whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; themselves can form biologically active serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better bowel function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01205-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/i&gt;, the researchers have identified two bacteria that together can produce serotonin: Limosilactobacillus mucosae and Ligilactobacillus ruminis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bacteria were introduced into germ-free mice with serotonin deficiency, the levels of serotonin in the gut increased, as did the density of nerve cells in the colon. The bacteria also normalized the intestinal transit time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is incredibly fascinating how the gut bacteria can produce bioactive signaling molecules that affect health," says Fredrik Bäckhed, Professor of molecular medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and one of the leading authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;New treatment options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to see that people with IBS had lower levels of one of the bacteria (L. mucosae) in their stools compared to healthy individuals, and that this bacterium also has the enzyme required for serotonin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnus Simrén is a Professor of medical gastroenterology at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg. "Our results indicate that certain intestinal bacteria can produce bioactive serotonin and thus play an important role in intestinal health and open new avenues for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that intestinal bacteria can form signaling substances such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serotonin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, which may be the key to understanding how the intestine and its inhabitants can affect our brain and behavior," concludes Bäckhed.&lt;/p&gt;
