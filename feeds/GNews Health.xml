This finding may help explain repetitive behaviors like stimming, which are common in autism and can serve as emotional regulation or sensory coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, virtual reality, and vibrotactile input, researchers created a realistic experimental setup to simulate touch and track brain responses. The study opens the door to understanding how sensory input impacts behavior and could inform future interventions to reduce harmful self-stimulation in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Perception Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with autism showed similar brain responses to both active and passive touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Prediction Deficit:&lt;/strong&gt; This may indicate difficulty in predicting sensory outcomes, which could underlie stimming behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Method:&lt;/strong&gt; The study combined EEG, virtual reality, and tactile simulation for realistic and rigorous sensory testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapping a pen, shaking a leg, twirling hair—we have all been in a classroom, meeting, or a public place where we find ourselves or someone else engaging in repetitive behavior—a type of self-stimulatory movement also known as stimming. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with autism, stimming can include movements like flicking fingers or rocking back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108762"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child touching a wall." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are believed to be used to deal with overwhelming sensory environments, regulate emotions, or express joy, but stimming is not well understood. And while the behaviors are mostly harmless and, in some instances, beneficial, stimming can also escalate and cause serious injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is a difficult behavior to study, especially when the behaviors involve self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more we learn about how benign active tactile sensations like stimming are processed, the closer we will be to understanding self-injurious behavior,” said Emily Isenstein, PhD (’24), Medical Scientist Training Program trainee at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and first author of the study in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; that provides new clues into how people with autism process touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By better understanding how the brain processes different types of touch, we hope to someday work toward more healthy outlets of expression to avoid self-injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used several technological methods to create a more realistic sensory experience for active touch—reaching and touching—and passive touch—being touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual reality headset simulated visual movement, while a vibrating finger clip—or vibrotactile disc—replicated touch. Using EEG, researchers measured the brain responses of 30 neurotypical adults and 29 adults with autism as they participated in active and passive touch tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. To measure passive touch, a virtual hand reached out to touch them. The participant felt vibrations when the two hands “touched,” simulating physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the researchers found that the neurotypical group had a smaller response in a brain signal to active touch when compared to passive touch, evidence that the brain does not use as many resources when it controls touch and knows what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the group with autism showed little variation in brain response to the two types of touch. Both were more in line with the neurotypical group’s brain response to passive touch, suggesting that in autism, the brain may have trouble distinguishing between active and passive inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be a clue that people with autism may have difficulty predicting the consequences of their actions, which could be what leads to repetitive behavior or stimming,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a surprising finding, particularly in adults. John Foxe, PhD, director of the Golisano Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Institute at the University of Rochester and co-senior author of the study, remarked that this may indicate the difference in children with autism could be greater than their neurotypical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many adults with autism have learned how to interact effectively with their environment, so the fact that we’re still finding differences in brain processing for active touch leads me to think this response may be more severe in kids, and that’s what we also need to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, Location, Location: Student Pools University Resources to Advance Autism Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into my PhD with the idea to have one big project that would use resources and expertise from both labs,” said Isenstein, who was co-mentored by Foxe and Duje Tadin, PhD, professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and co-senior author on the &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew pretty early on that I wanted to study something that would help us understand stimming, but it’s a pretty complicated concept. Everyone has been incredibly supportive of me building my ‘dream team’ of collaborations to make this experiment possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isenstein employed the expertise in EEG and touch from the Frederick J. and Marion A. Schindler Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab for her study. While the means to study proprioception—or sense of self-movement—and virtual reality came from the Tadin Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are not stationary creatures, and things that happen when you are sitting still getting an EEG do not really mimic how you interact with things in real life,” said Isenstein. “It [virtual reality] was a really exciting way to study proprioception and body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was easy to see the importance of the project Emily proposed. It was also clear how difficult it would be to conduct a rigorous EEG study of active and passive touch in autism,” said Tadin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emily achieved this goal by spearheading the first collaboration between John’s lab and mine, leveraging the resources and expertise from the Medical Center and the University, including the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X. This is a wonderful example of the boundless possibilities in Rochester for a motivated student who takes advantage of the robust research resources that are available here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, vibrotactile inputs, and virtual reality in research is not novel, but creating a study where the three technologies work in tandem, is a newer approach. Isenstein also turned to the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X at the University of Rochester to brainstorm how to get these technologies to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio X is an extended reality hub on campus that offers workshops, equipment rentals, and provides a multidisciplinary space for researchers and creators to collaborate on projects. “It really is an incredible resource for researchers trying to incorporate virtual reality into their research,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup went through several trial periods to figure out how to do it without compromising data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting when I could finally get to the point to use these technologies together,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ended up mounting the VR headset onto a frame that people could just lean into and then their hands were free to move around and do whatever. And their head was still very stationary. This setup allowed the team to simulate a realistic sensory environment without compromising on data quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers aim to apply these methods to more complex movements in people with autism to understand stimming better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Ed Freedman, PhD, Grace Rico, and Zakilya Brown of the University of Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Schmitt Program in Integrative Neuroscience (SPIN) through the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience pilot program, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Eye Institute, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this tactile processing and ASD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdf6d8d1ced4d8e2eed0d4c9d590f5dcc4d9c8d6fdc8cfd0de93cfd2ded5d8cec9d8cf93d8d9c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rochester.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk – University of Rochester&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adults on the autism spectrum differ from neurotypical peers when self-generating but not passively-experiencing somatosensation: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping and virtual reality study&lt;/a&gt;” by Emily Isenstein et al. &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults on the autism spectrum differ from neurotypical peers when self-generating but not passively-experiencing somatosensation: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping and virtual reality study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how different features of tactile inputs affect somatosensory perception in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study we combined high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and virtual reality (VR) to assess how the volition and pattern consistency of somatosensory stimulation influenced the electrophysiological responses in neurotypical (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 30) and autistic (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 30) adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we compared N1 and P300 amplitudes when vibrotactile stimulation were actively triggered by self-motion (Active) versus passively triggered by target-motion (Passive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) to assess how deviations in the pattern of stimulus duration affected the electrophysiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed comparable responses regardless of pattern deviation in the MMN time window between groups, but different patterns of amplitude in this time frame based on whether the stimulation was Active or Passive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autism group we observed smaller N1 amplitudes in response to Passive, but not Active, vibrations as compared to the control group. Conversely, there were overall larger magnitude P300 amplitudes in the autism group, but comparable levels of Passive-to-Active attenuation between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the autism cohort demonstrated variation from the neurotypical cohort with respect to the volition of the stimuli, but there were comparable results between groups in response to pattern deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that there are subtle differences in how adults with and without autism handle self-generated and externally-generated somatosensory sensations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpNks0YnlIbzNodWNjWU1DV2JYWjRZR0dob0N5U3JxZlpMMGRQTnlhYm5XVy1IV1hnb3duMUV0eTR3czQwM3Q2Z2xPc004M0FoaVdkM2F4QU1TTXlLWFZGLXNoWDYwakFuZUE</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员调查在华盛顿特区餐厅用餐的麻疹患者- WTOP | Health officials investigating person with measles who ate at DC restaurant - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQN0FscFlfVEJZM2lhTUJVak5MaFRDNzB3emJSa2YxT0JMdFdYRDgyeVc5VWkwODdpVjh0clhzbnpSQ1BDSW1HMGU5SUtlZWVseVNUV205MlhLbk5hZS03aHlyRHMzOC1JLS1HUjJlQ1BkcENyLVZhYjBhd0ZTLVcyRnlkeUZXZ203MXZYTDByME00ZUdFUjc4Y0Yxam1wRUZWUkktZ2p2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C.

                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health says a person with a confirmed measles diagnosis ate at a local restaurant in early April. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C. Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles develop in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The first stage begins seven to 14 days after exposure and often presents with a fever over 101 degrees along with a runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a cough. The second stage occurs three to five days after the initial symptoms start and consists of a rash on the face that gradually spreads to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;D.C. Health says a person with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were possibly exposed to measles and are not immune should contact their healthcare provider or D.C. Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with symptoms should immediately isolate and stay away from others, then call a healthcare provider. D.C. Health says that anyone with symptoms should call ahead before going to a healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room to notify them of any exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second known case of measles in D.C. this year. D.C. Health &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/dc-health-officials-confirmed-measles-case-in-the-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed a positive case of measles in late March&lt;/a&gt; in a person who rode on an Amtrak train to Union Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. counties with the most egregious &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/"&gt;water quality violations&lt;/a&gt; are concentrated in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oklahoma, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Standing out among the top-10 such regions was Wyoming County, W. Va., whose public water utility boasted the highest number of infringements in a single water system, according to the study, published Tuesday in international journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70012"&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;About 2 million people nationwide — equivalent to Nebraska’s entire population — do not have running water, and this lack of basic drinking water services tends to occur in clusters, the study authors determined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This high number is neither equally nor proportionally distributed across the population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With another 30 million people reliant on &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/"&gt;drinking water systems&lt;/a&gt; that violate safety rules, the researchers sought to determine what types of systems are most prone to these deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many experts have proposed water privatization — the transfer of public water systems to the ownership or management of private companies — as a potential solution to making U.S. water cleaner and safer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, the authors explained, opponents have argued that such a switch could cause companies to prioritize profits over public needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore decided to investigative how the implementation of private versus public system operations impacts &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5236857-epa-review-fluoride-health-impacts-drinking-water/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt; and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To do so, they mapped out the country’s distribution of system ownership, violations, water injustice and perceptions of water access among residents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the violations included in the research were failures to abide by regulations under the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;Safe Drinking Water Act&lt;/a&gt;, such as exceedances of maximum contaminant levels, non-compliance with required water treatment protocols and the absence of monitoring schedules or communication to customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that privatization alone is not a solution,” lead author Alex Segrè Cohen, an assistant professor of science and risk communication at the University of Oregon, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The local context, such as regulatory enforcement, community vulnerability, and community priorities, matters in determining outcomes,” Segrè Cohen added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highest-ranking counties that exhibited water injustice issues were in Mississippi — home to eight out of top 10 such spots — as well as South Dakota and Texas, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined water injustice as “the unequal access to safe and clean drinking water that disproportionately impacts low-income households and people of color.” They thereby formulated a county-level score based on a combination of water system performance and community social vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Water injustice hotspots were more often situated in regions with lower private system ownership and stronger public system presence — suggesting that public systems are not necessarily superior at curbing violations, the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that residing in a county that has both increased water injustice and a higher proportion of privatized systems was linked to a stronger perception of vulnerability around water access and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the authors expressed hope that lawmakers and regulators would be able to utilize the research to inform their water management strategies and narrow down their areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Policymakers can use our findings to identify and prioritize enforcement efforts in hotspots, make improvements in infrastructure and implement policies that ensure affordable and safe drinking water — particularly for socially vulnerable communities,” Segrè Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;

People often assume that it must be safe if something grows in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/5/875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; points to a more complicated picture. Concerns have risen over the potentially harmful effects of long-term folk herb consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab, an assistant professor at &lt;a href="http://www.bau.edu.lb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beirut Arab University&lt;/a&gt;, has led an investigation into some of these concerns. She explored how certain frequently consumed plants might impact liver and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-herbs-under-suspicion"&gt;Herbs under suspicion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, medications have been primarily sourced from plants. Due to their high therapeutic potential and ability to improve well-being, which has improved quality of life since ancient times, herbal drugs are widely accepted by the general population,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various communities in the Middle East have long relied on homegrown solutions for digestive complaints and overall vitality. Some of these plants are now under the microscope because they may carry unknown risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-often-contain-hidden-ingredients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; that are known among locals are rarely tested for prolonged use. Investigators discovered that certain extracts could affect internal organs in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-use-of-herbal-remedies"&gt;Long-term use of herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted experiments on adult male rats. Tissue studies and &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/ncds/ncd-surveillance/steps/part3-section6.pdf?sfvrsn=73a06c16_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biochemical measurements&lt;/a&gt; offered fresh insights into how these plant extracts might alter body function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight a real need for caution when using these plants for extended periods. Although these herbs have a long history of traditional use, their potential adverse effects should not be overlooked,” said Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-perspectives-on-health"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New perspectives on health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt; to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/synthetic-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt;. They might assume that a leaf or root with a long lineage of human use is free of undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts caution that some herbal remedies contain potent chemicals that burden the liver and kidneys. Regulators continue to stress the importance of quality control to avoid contaminated or adulterated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-are-cautious"&gt;Experts are cautious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on herbal toxicity remain relatively scarce in comparison to pharmaceutical research. That gap in data means individuals might be tempted to assume safety without scientific proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators in different parts of the world have raised questions about the daily consumption of certain teas, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chia-seeds-have-great-potential-to-improve-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, or extracts. There is also concern that people may self-prescribe herbs at higher doses than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conflict-between-herbs-and-modern-drugs"&gt;Conflict between herbs and modern drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists and healthcare practitioners often advise people to inform their doctors about the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-are-not-always-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbal supplements&lt;/a&gt; that they regularly consume. Even mild interactions could pose problems, especially for those on prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the potential synergy or conflict between herbs and modern drugs is an ongoing challenge. Experts emphasize that patients should report all substances to their doctor, whether natural or synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-balance-with-herbal-remedies"&gt;Finding balance with herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals argue that centuries of usage point to inherent safety. Others believe that scientific validation is necessary for each claim, no matter how time-honored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study encourages a cautious stance toward daily reliance on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wild-plant-extracts-can-block-covid-19-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant extracts&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to health choices, knowledge can reduce unfortunate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-paths-forward"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Potential paths forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials may explore whether moderate dosages or different preparations of these herbs could lessen any strain on the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-causes-liver-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys. A better grasp of chemical composition might also pave the way for safer herbal solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public outreach campaigns could inform consumers about the possible downsides of unsupervised herbal remedies. This might involve educational programs that outline risks and emphasize expert guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fine-print-on-herbal-products"&gt;The fine print on herbal products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labels on herbs often lack comprehensive warnings. More detailed descriptions would help users make better choices before trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that process or market these items might consider investing in toxicity research. A product with thorough safety data will gain trust more easily than one without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tradition-and-science"&gt;Tradition and science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every generation refines its approach to well-being. By blending traditional knowledge with scientific scrutiny, society can benefit from the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions about herbal remedies should always involve careful thought and consultation. These concerns highlight why further research remains vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/5/875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:45:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9qQ1VGTWRhWTRZczd2THY5QVlYU1F6bUNPNE1pN2lmQTlpVlV2SW9neXY2NWUxWWt4b0Zqd0dRdVRKU3VVTmtEOUZyam1YOWhSY3JBVGNveGlWb0ZWVGlkWkl2WlVlYmVrM3dSV1FBdnRrbFRiSElR</guid></item><item><title>饮用这种果汁可以减少40%的肠道炎症- SciTechDaily | Drinking This Fruit Juice May Cut Gut Inflammation by 40% - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNWmlJUVR5NDFSWlVSTTJidWJwR04tZzFUNjNJcDZVWjJQVklMaFBMUWVhSkI5U2x1YkJ5MTQxb0ljOTBUR1lHUXNrdzltM1BCbUVZazZ5UEtTN2lhWS1vRzdVamVMdlpiMFhUMklIS3g4akdFR3Y4czl4NWJiUzBVVWh2QnRfOTBiN2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:35:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNWmlJUVR5NDFSWlVSTTJidWJwR04tZzFUNjNJcDZVWjJQVklMaFBMUWVhSkI5U2x1YkJ5MTQxb0ljOTBUR1lHUXNrdzltM1BCbUVZazZ5UEtTN2lhWS1vRzdVamVMdlpiMFhUMklIS3g4akdFR3Y4czl4NWJiUzBVVWh2QnRfOTBiN2c</guid></item><item><title>患有不安腿综合症的医生分享了唯一可以缓解他的症状的黑客技巧-并且适用于十分之九-每日邮报 | Doctor with restless leg syndrome shares the only hack that relieves his symptoms - and works for nine in ten - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQbnYtZ2xSSnpzY3lwbUxpZVBJc1ZEX3BVTkN0dFpCbnM1dzgxanBrWUstOTdObFlqNG5CRUdWd29kc2Z6RWlIamFaVVpVXzJUVWQ4cnVQdVNyZG1OOVh3WTNUWFlVc1pqSWphZzYwelJQQTE4S2N0VERKei1zTHlDNDBLRjN0N3NmYy11TWxWMXhPNVJDemVlN0RFSDhIR1UxVFlwbmlwZWRRNVdf0gGyAUFVX3lxTE5GWlpjdjIzYWJBUmtkU0haMEk2T2RDUVVjYXluempnQzZUemt6TWtPWUtlMlJQSGh3MGFKNklYLUxUTWZXWm9pdzAyakJ6NmtueTEtRUFIQlZkOG16REw1LTVlc3c5dDBlYUdONko2LVI0OTJJejNQUUNielhlejgxbWJ3alY0TzQ3WEhvN1pJNVVzOXZ2elIzZGh0alJ0U0lhZnlabE1mZXB1eU8wZkk4UFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top doctor has revealed a life-changing hack that could provide instant relief to the millions of people kept up at night by restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;Dr Joe Whittington&lt;/a&gt;, a US-based emergency room medic, tying socks around the feet could help calm overactive nerves that drive the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram post that has been viewed more than 120,000 times, Dr Joe—who revealed he suffers from restless legs himself—urged people to try the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tying a sock or wrap just below your toes might actually calm restless leg syndrome' and, there is 'real science' behind it, Dr Joe claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as Willis-Ekbom disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482545/Restless-legs-causes-misery-unusual-cure-help-DR-SCURR.html"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which affects one in ten adults, is described by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-05452610-19dd-11f0-9959-415bc15f02d6" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; as an overwhelming urge to move the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients often report the symptoms being at their worst at night, in bed, when the body is relaxed—although it is not clear why, or what causes the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, it can also cause unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe, who has 782,000 Instagram followers, demonstrated in the video how to tie the socks to provide long-lasting relief: 'Make it just snug enough to apply a little bit of pressure. Do this for both feet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor added: 'This simple foot compression technique can significantly reduce restless leg syndrome symptoms by triggering pressure points that help relax overactive nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As someone who struggles with restless legs themselves, this technique has been by far the most effective thing for me and my symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn't just work for him, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A clinical study has been shown to decrease restless leg symptoms in 90 per cent of the people that tried it', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe's intervention comes as patients were warned last month that the drugs used to treat restless leg symptoms could trigger an unexpected and bizarre sexual side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs—known as dopamine antagonists—interact with parts of the brain that control movement, helping to ease restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, more that a dozen women have now claimed the drugs, such as ropinirole, saw them develop compulsive gambling and sex addictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'unusual urge to gamble or increased sexual urges' is listed as a general side-effect in the patient information leaflets provided alongside the drug.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With women twice as likely to develop restless leg syndrome as men, Dr Joe stresses the benefits of the life-changing and 'drug free' hack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also believe that exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night, and following a regular bedtime routine could help ease symptoms in mild cases of restless leg syndrome that are not linked to an underlying health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            During a Cabinet meeting last week, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed what is now the second-worst measles outbreak in the US since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t002z336ocp4muj0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has claimed repeatedly that measles cases have “plateaued,” despite contradictory data from his own federal agencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0030336o9b4jdn2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, the health department in Texas – the center of the outbreak that now spans multiple states – reported 232 new cases over the past three weeks, 42% more than in the three weeks before that. New outbreaks have also been reported in &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthy.arkansas.gov/article/second-case-of-measles-in-arkansas-identified-in-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0031336o8zixqh1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, there have been at least 735 cases in 24 states this year, according to CNN’s tally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0032336ogpw6axk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, many experts believe that the actual case count stands in the thousands.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0033336o5qnhep72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think any of us have full situational awareness of what’s going on with this outbreak,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “You can’t say something is flattening if you don’t actually know the denominator of cases or [have] an understanding you’re getting [the] full capture of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0034336ovgfv0pid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some experts think the number of deaths alone indicates that cases are deeply undercounted. The measles fatality rate is typically up to 3 deaths per 1,000 cases. But three deaths have already been reported in the ongoing outbreak in — two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico — even though the official outbreak case count stands at not quite 650 between Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9htsf2900003b6oyslzz5ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Underreporting could also be happening for a variety of reasons, and that makes it difficult to predict exactly how bad this outbreak will get and how long it will last, said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, and a former epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0037336ok37d3l7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better data would be helpful, Masters said, to help public health officials set expectations about how big an outbreak might get, to help public health departments figure out where to allocate resources and to better understand what might be affecting cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjirbw00013b6ocsavt3pk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak has mainly infected people who were not vaccinated or whose vaccine status is unknown. If a local agency knows who is unvaccinated, it could do more targeted outreach to help persuade them to get protected against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0039336ool4uktz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine works rapidly and has been shown to provide the best protection against measles, particularly when it’s given to people in affected areas quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003a336oooohimal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a measles outbreak at a migrant shelter in Chicago last year, Masters – then with the CDC – created a model to predict the size of the outbreak and another to determine what effect interventions would have.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003b336owx9yhzwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In both of those models, the results were very non-subtle that mass vaccination is really the way to bring these outbreaks under control, and the days matter. If you delay by a week, that increases the size of the outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003c336okl42ehgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without mass vaccinations in the affected community in Chicago, the model predicted, there would be 250 cases. But because vaccines were administered quickly, there were only 57.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003e336ov7dv7rlo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Mark S. Roberts was part of an effort to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31433482/" target="_blank"&gt;create a model&lt;/a&gt; that took into account Texas’ expected number of unvaccinated to predict what a measles outbreak there would look like.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjn5ie00063b6oeumfroyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until recently, the prediction was eerily similar to the case count in the current outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said Roberts, a distinguished professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management and director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjmpd900043b6ob9j33q3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, though, cases in some counties have even outpaced the prediction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003f336ow6tqbe92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, had 355 cases as of April 11, and the state health department says that number is expected to continue to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003g336ongqdbfte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there had been an outbreak in Gaines County in 2018, Roberts’ model predicted 270 cases, 100 of whom would be “bystanders” — not children whose parents refused vaccination but those who couldn’t get vaccinated or for whom the vaccine hadn’t fully worked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjoumr00083b6owiuglwo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts and many other public health experts are frustrated by the deaths that have already taken place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003h336o7r286mu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s freaking 2025, and a child has died of measles,” Roberts said. “It’s just not right. This is a disease that, 12 years ago, we basically had eradicated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003i336or9uy8pja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models are helpful in an outbreak, but even with all the data in the world, Roberts knows, not everyone is going to listen to the message that the unvaccinated need protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjqicq000b3b6o6kp2ilqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, he presented his model to the Texas Legislature. Lawmakers asked good questions and understood what he showed them, he said, but not a single law was passed to improve vaccination rates in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003j336ox1uczg7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The thing that’s really sad about this is that all of this was predictable and totally avoidable,” Roberts said. “It’s just really sad.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003l336ovj1sa3oh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases may be undercounted in the ongoing outbreak, Masters said, because people aren’t getting tested or because they may be staying away from hospitals. In the Mennonite community that has been the center of the outbreak in Texas, there is a great sense of self-reliance and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;a preference for home remedies&lt;/a&gt; over doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003m336ocdodl113@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s a little difficult to tease apart which element of the underreporting Is leaning in which direction,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003n336oidl2bi02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reason it’s been hard to get an accurate case count is because of massive federal funding cuts for public health. The CDC pulled back over &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/health-department-grant-cuts-cdc-hhs/index.html"&gt;$11 billion in grants&lt;/a&gt; allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic that state and local health departments had been using to respond to a variety of public health threats, including measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hj7zem00003b6ot7td7oe0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In New Mexico, where at least 58 cases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been reported, a pullback of federal funds meant the public health department had to terminate contracts for 20 temporary workers who were helping with the measles response by checking vaccination records.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003o336ot18uy78n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phil Huang, Health and Human Services director in Dallas County, Texas, said that in addition to canceling dozens of vaccine clinics in school districts with low vaccination rates, he had to lay off 11 permanent staff and 10 temporary workers, including three who work in the labs used to detect measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003p336ojmta10rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those are our numbers so far,” he said. “We are looking at perhaps a few further cuts in the near future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003q336ocz7b93zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These cuts mean real numbers may become even more difficult to pin down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003t336o0if7rl0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles, a highly contagious virus, behaves in an entirely predictable fashion, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003u336o8tbu8q7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It behaves almost the same way in almost every setting,” she said. “If someone has measles, they go into a room with a bunch of people who are susceptible to measles, a lot of those people are going to get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003v336ovttvnhan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said last week that the US is a “model for the rest of the world” when it comes to managing measles, but the country is no longer as effective at preventing outbreaks because of decreasing vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003w336o22sgnyl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Saying we’re better or no worse off than other countries, that’s misleading at best and kind of a whitewash of the significance of this measles outbreak,” said Dr. Bill Moss, a professor in epidemiology and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003x336om2nvlago@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is true that, historically, the United States has done better than many other countries in the world,” he said. “That’s because we’ve had a strong immunization program.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003y336oamnvmvtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles had been declared eliminated in the US in 2000 because the majority of people were vaccinated, but that number has been falling since the Covid-19 pandemic – even before a lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines/index.html"&gt;with a history&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine skepticism took over HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003z336ouxduzc5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, just 68.5% of kids in the US had their first dose of the MMR vaccine by 15 months of age, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/health/measles-vaccine-first-dose-decline/index.html"&gt;new report from Truveta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a significant decline from 2020, when more than 77% of kids got their first shot by this age. And it’s far short of the federal goal of 95% of children in kindergarten having had their second dose, the threshold needed to prevent measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hkbv9k0000336ovuwft52b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year had not gotten the shot. Some other counties in the affected states also fall below the 95% benchmark, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlhgj5001h3b6o47z2zjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kansas, for example, only 90% of kindergartners have gotten their MMR vaccines. The Sublette Unified School District in the southwestern part of the state, where most of the state’s cases are concentrated, has a vaccination rate of just 44%, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data" target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0040336oe5852e6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working on Truveta’s report “set off real alarm bells for me,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0041336ot3e7m34a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles vaccination rates mean the country is no longer closing immunity gaps like it used to, “which is very concerning for the future of this outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0042336oswzwzolq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has said that people should get the MMR vaccine, but he has also said that doing so should be a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;personal choice.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            With so much hesitancy in areas that have seen so many cases, experts say that here needs to be a clearer message from the top and that, as with a 2019 measles outbreak, many more people will need to be convinced that getting a vaccine is not just in their best interest, it is also in the best interest of the community.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2u0043336oiqhtihdb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important for people to know, not vaccinating your child doesn’t only put your child at risk, it puts other children at risk,” Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiodqu002x336olcd7iuor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

After the family's home remedy of cod liver oil failed, they took Daisy to the hospital, where she was diagnosed her with strep throat, mononucleosis (a contagious viral infection) and measles.

Two Mennonite residents, Helen and Helena, had conflicting views on the jabs. One said she vaccinated her children because it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't - believing infections like measles "make their immune system stronger".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Another resident, Joselyn said she doesn't want to vaccinate her children because she claims to know people who have suffered adverse reactions. Judy said her family have gone without the MMR vaccine because they "don't like the things in it". Of the 700 measles cases in the US, 541 have been recorded in Texas alone - and&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;70% of these cases are among children and young babies.&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Measles is an infectious virus that weakens the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to secondary infections like pneumonia. Those who are vaccinated have a significantly lower risk of falling ill, as the jab is 93% effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97% effective after a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Many in the Mennonite community however believe vaccinations should be a personal choice, even though they are not strictly forbidden in scripture. Around 3,000 people out of 22,000 in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures released in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9jcW55a0JpRXh1ZHBiRzBNRjJWTF9SWkxCSzRKb01WbEU1Q1JPZU41R0ItQ2JlQ2RWbVM3UDZxSjVHZEE1ak9mX0RoaUY0MjFtNC02bEk1OGZPMUhOZk95Y3ZWNUNCb1JzQVRzVkFEUTNONTlfcFRIWC00SU5vR2PSAYQBQVVfeXFMT3d5elF6bkdtVzRhSDRQTGlibjR4US1LSHU5YzdBaFU3RWQ4Q2xSU0lBSnJnTUktTWNuM1NkcGVfbUFwSkNKNGZiNERBMDYyTUozOUV0RnItSUc3NGVGRW0wQ215am5qZjhfYTlrSllsdFVkcTd3NDJKM2pzbXpVampKMFot</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，早餐用核桃可以改善一整天的大脑功能-《独立报》 | Walnuts for breakfast could improve brain function throughout the day, study suggests - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQNmlLaTlDRDRJU1dzWmk5VjRFUWg0LXAzVkI2RHVVQmwwREd2VXlKVG80ZXc2REJYMFo1VHVTdlhCd002X3ljdjZSc1NTTWZfRFY3VHRDRk9oUml5eUdVYzNEdjlwMERjaFhSaDI0YjNmZzZkQVc5QW1RczZGTmlfdU9INXlrR3RfU3BzTVJIY0dGTS14bTdIUXZzWVpIS0FQLUhXOEhKdFE2QmJVSlplTlV0WXoxRTFLQmM0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 caTeJB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 blUixN"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cfrdoh"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

It's particularly exciting that such a simple dietary addition could make a measurable difference to cognitive performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that while memory recall performance after two hours was worse when people ate walnuts, after six hours, the finding was reversed and walnuts outperformed the control dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to examine the immediate effect of walnuts on brain function for young adults throughout a single day, building on previous research that shows how regular nut consumption improves cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of a walnut-rich breakfast were evident in a younger population, researchers noted that it remains to be seen whether it would also benefit older people or clinical populations, such as those with cognitive impairment or metabolic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of brain activity suggest that walnuts may help the brain work more efficiently during challenging mental tasks, while blood samples revealed positive changes in glucose and fatty acid levels, which can influence brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested that walnuts have a special mix of &lt;a href="/topic/nutrients"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; - including omega-3 alpha linolenic fatty acids, &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, and plant compounds called polyphenols - that may improve how the brain performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers noted that more research was needed to fully understand how walnuts produce these beneficial effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQNmlLaTlDRDRJU1dzWmk5VjRFUWg0LXAzVkI2RHVVQmwwREd2VXlKVG80ZXc2REJYMFo1VHVTdlhCd002X3ljdjZSc1NTTWZfRFY3VHRDRk9oUml5eUdVYzNEdjlwMERjaFhSaDI0YjNmZzZkQVc5QW1RczZGTmlfdU9INXlrR3RfU3BzTVJIY0dGTS14bTdIUXZzWVpIS0FQLUhXOEhKdFE2QmJVSlplTlV0WXoxRTFLQmM0</guid></item><item><title>快速家庭健康测试：检查您的反应时间- BBC | Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWTBFZXpvREZUcVVuQzdpSF9zNUUtT0hobUVDZ0lnd2h0ZDE1dENsbGZBQmZXLVIwbVBwSmNXOXBHdjlRbTVmaDJsc0x4X3N5UllMbFVoMlBOZERzM2hSdjhza0dWVHlaNWxkWURpakdITmhVOUsxR2pxSE5HYlZxR0kwSmZmNnlwN255Wnd6ek5uUS1EWVJlUUhIRmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A black-and-white photo of a hand holding a stopwatch (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="your-reaction-times-can-reveal-a-surprising-amount-about-what's-going-on-inside-your-body,-from-your-brain-health-to-your-risk-of-an-early-death." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Your reaction times can reveal a surprising amount about what's going on inside your body, from your brain health to your risk of an early death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Of the course of our lifetimes, our reaction times will slowly wane. It's one of the reasons why athletic performance tends to drop off &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39019444/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;from our 30s onwards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Scientists are finding that being able to maintain an average reaction speed can be a key indicator that our brain is still in good working order, even into our latter decades. But that isn't all they can reveal. From your heart health to your &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30100646/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;overall risk of an early death&lt;/a&gt;, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in," says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. "But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the "zero", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Broadly speaking, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4207053/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;an excellent performance equates&lt;/a&gt; to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280496/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;vary considerably&lt;/a&gt; from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time – for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As Cox points out, our ability to react &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/motor-reaction-time" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;relies on&lt;/a&gt; a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. "All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people," says Cox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test – the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423772/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds – but it still takes a while for the body to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Pain recommends so-called dual task training such as walking while turning your head from side to side or balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/44/15/e1596232024.full.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7493202" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have waned&lt;/a&gt;, or because our mitochondria – the components within our cells which generate energy – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0501559102" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;are working less well&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster," says Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4208637/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;by measuring&lt;/a&gt; the "startle reflex" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a "move" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse," says Pain. "Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test&lt;/a&gt; which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt; found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing," says Cox. "Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Improving your score&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times.

                An advisory committee of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is set to meet Tuesday to discuss vaccines for RSV, COVID and others.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the first time since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are meeting publicly to discuss the nation's vaccine policies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A meeting of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304233/cdc-vaccine-meeting-delayed" target="_blank"&gt;initially scheduled for February&lt;/a&gt; but was postponed, raising concerns among some scientists and those working in public health about political interference in vaccine policy. The two-day meeting starts Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's advice shapes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5293507/cdc-rfk-vaccine-advice" target="_blank"&gt;access to and insurance coverage for vaccines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm reassured and very glad to see that it's happening," says &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;Claire Hannan&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. "It's important to have this ongoing review of data and science, looking at the evidence that goes into the vaccine schedule in an open forum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisory committee typically holds public meetings three times a year, which are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RR7Es9sdNpY" target="_blank"&gt;live streamed online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During this week's meeting, the committee's independent advisors will hear from CDC staff on a range of vaccines, including HPV, COVID and flu, and vote on recommendations for some of them such as RSV and the tropical mosquito-borne viral disease chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current agenda is similar to the proposed agenda for February, though it omits a vote on influenza vaccines that was on that agenda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When asked about the change, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded on behalf of CDC: "ACIP agenda items are always subject to change depending on what the working groups have ready for consideration." She further clarified: "This was not the annual vote for the routine use of the influenza vaccine for the upcoming season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisors are independent experts who volunteer to serve on the committee. &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at UC San Francisco, says she expects them to remain independent and hold thoughtful, rigorous discussions as they usually do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But she's concerned about the effects of political interference on CDC staff who help run these meetings, who "are in a much more vulnerable position after extensive layoffs," Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There have been deep cuts to CDC staff since President Trump took office, including some officials who would have participated or spoken in this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's had a chilling effect on those who are left.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'll be looking to see if they change the process in any way," Reiss says. For example she says she'll be watching for changes in how conflicts of interest are handled – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;a topic Kennedy has raised repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; – or whether they put time limits on discussions among committee members, Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Signs of political interference may be subtle, says Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and data scientist who writes the newsletter "&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Your Local Epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt;." What it may take, she says, is "for those of us that have listened to hundreds of ACIP meetings to report back whether it is just business as usual or there's some sketch things beneath the surface."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advocates are concerned over potential shifts in policy and official stances that may reduce confidence in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I don't want to see go away is a very strong endorsement of the use of vaccines as preventive medicine," says Dr. Anthony Fiore, a former CDC official who worked closely with the vaccine advisory committee before retiring from the agency in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's concerned because Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cast doubt on vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;canceled funding&lt;/a&gt; for research into vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Up to this point, every HHS director and every CDC director has been very enthusiastic about vaccines as they save money and they're an excellent preventive tool," Fiore says. But if public confidence in vaccines gets undermined, vaccination levels could drop below the levels needed to reduce transmission and protect the population from disease, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But getting sick is not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21858" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used 2019 data on cancer cases among U.S. adults ages 30 and older, and they estimated that about 40 percent of cases were caused by lifestyle factors you can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“That’s actually good news,” said Dr. Farhad Islami, the lead author of the study and senior scientific director of cancer disparity research at the American Cancer Society.

Experts Share What Your Bowel Movements Mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome," Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/microbiome-testing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of an unhealthy gut may include vomiting or stomach upset, fatigue, trouble sleeping, food intolerance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gut-health#improving-gut-health" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;and other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin irritation or problems may be one particularly visible sign, as some research &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;links skin issues like acne and psoriasis&lt;/a&gt; to the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into how it &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/the-abcs-of-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-precautions-and-proper-dosage/" target="_self"&gt;The ABCs of Apple Cider Vinegar: Benefits, Precautions and Proper Dosage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to help your gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to get to the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fiber to your diet and drinking more water are easy first steps to a healthier gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, probiotics like curd are good bacteria that assist with digestion and improve your microbiome and overall gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPd3Z2TmlBWUw1WngzM1JZQlFrNVlqREduTElsa3pydzFsZkpjZU1lbHZtelNDX0E1YWVpZUtjVS1Vcnh3VTVqNmVDLVNuUGJ4Qno1MDBpWnJUTER3SGl6dHBiVGt6RFVXOThacFRkWVEwQlpHQ01pbVAxSE4yRWMxWDJ6OA</guid></item><item><title>两分钟的运动可以降低高胆固醇的风险- Surrey Live | Two minute exercise can reduce risk of high cholesterol - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNekdXVEhYMk03S2o5X1ViMkZaVkxxZF9sODRtdmh4X09YUXpUbXAzNDZZdFFLTXdsMG1HT0FxMFJLRFQ2Y3l6TE5KY1pZbnZ4YU5aaV9ka3JsYXpoNlhqY1VLUEI1WTdBY0hyQmJ0cUk5NlNhS3liTENobmx3ZUNRNE13NkVHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to the gym can feel overwhelming for a lot of us but there are some exercises you can do in the comfort of your own home to reduce the risk of high cholesterol. Staying active helps your body move the bad cholesterol to your liver where it can be eventually removed out of your system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fact, there are four quick exercises you can add to your daily routine to see health benefits. While ‘bad’ cholesterol increases your risk of life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease and stroke, there is also ‘good’ cholesterol that performs crucial functions the body cannot survive without, such as making hormones, building cells, aiding digestion and synthesising vitamin D from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although high cholesterol is often managed with medication called statins - taken by millions of people in the UK every day - lifestyle changes can help to keep things under control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Quick exercises:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking the stairs: &lt;/b&gt;This daily simple swap can be an easy way to give you a more active lifestyle, if you can, avoid taking the lift and opt for the stairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brisk walk: &lt;/b&gt;Getting steps in could be a great addition to kicking off a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-minute exercise:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-cholesterol/five-top-questions-about-lowering-cholesterol" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; suggests bursts of jumping jacks several times a day can be a great way to stay active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga or Pilates: &lt;/b&gt;If you're looking for low impact exercise that will still ensure you stay active, try following a YouTube video or joining a local class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study in 'Sports Medicine' found that almost any kind of exercise can have a major impact on cholesterol. Another study suggests that psychological stress was also a contributing factor to high cholesterol, and physical activity could mitigate that risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any major changes you make, make sure to consult a medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNekdXVEhYMk03S2o5X1ViMkZaVkxxZF9sODRtdmh4X09YUXpUbXAzNDZZdFFLTXdsMG1HT0FxMFJLRFQ2Y3l6TE5KY1pZbnZ4YU5aaV9ka3JsYXpoNlhqY1VLUEI1WTdBY0hyQmJ0cUk5NlNhS3liTENobmx3ZUNRNE13NkVHQQ</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家首次开发用于早期检测帕金森氏症的血液检测-以色列时报 | Israeli scientists develop first-ever blood test for early detection of Parkinson’s - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 06:49:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPSHdxcmRaQmN5R1JDM05uM3J3eTJrcm9oVU5UYS0tMlJkWWliNU1ZUnExSVV4bzJuLUdSZWhUYWRQSERvR0szSEl1TDRLeUpjZEw4QmNlNFBxM2pPcnI0TjlhdTNGanpkbGRVYTNtRXJOLXlMZ3I0eFhTTnFLSnl5Nk5iS1ozakJ5aTRNTl9FQVZZNy1PRHJ4RVJNVXJRRHZGY2N5WXl0YTVvRjBnZnpyYXZPVdIBuAFBVV95cUxNQ0JqMThuTkl5Rm1UUm00dTdZLXdQa3Zadkp4eTFkSXZrdnpUNEg2YmI0U1JUVDNfbGRSTVBLZWJLSkEyNnotYjNuZDUxa1BoOERLaGFXUzJBM2VqWnlyb3dQRlpIR1lLR3l0OXdfZ1lfTmxmeXFSdzUyMUQ3d3RUTDYybWt2MU1NZlNNM2dIWnFKaEJGZXdGNjNmblNtRWtLUDRwR212amJOZVBESEhzQnU3dHZMeG93</guid></item><item><title>“被遗忘的”西南皮肤患者的生活地狱- BBC | Living hell for 'forgotten' South West skin patients - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBWamJfazNlT1BjdklFR0EtOTBnRDRsRnBkTFhlSmwwOXVyV3lkZ1pVN2QtQ2dGbENaMXctT1dROGdJcUcxTHlpeXptZFBWb2FWYWZZelk5X3hBUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1rNmc1TllDZGVpTEVkYklhQnBaU2d4UFRVQVNCYjVETHBha1hhcHlvS0NRMzl1X0lFcFVUZGNRVEhzMDBaeEJxVW5kd0tsLXBtR1Joak5jVDFKUkMtR2ZV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Living hell for 'forgotten' skin patients&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Amy Gladwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC South West Investigations Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Head and shoulders of Elle Jones, 19, with medium brown straight hair and fair skin, standing on a winter beach.

counteract the challenges" using digital technology, patient images and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She adds patients who are suffering while waiting should

&lt;p&gt;If you struggle to reach your daily movement goal or you’re too busy for regular walks, the trending 666 walking challenge could help you hit your target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves doing a six-minute warm-up, walking for 60 minutes, then doing a six-minute cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do this at 6am or 6pm, depending on your schedule—and according to walking coach &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joyceshulman.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.joyceshulman.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Joyce Shulman&lt;/a&gt;, it's a great way to experience the many &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-should-you-do-the-666-walking-challenge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When should you do the 666 walking challenge?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can walk at either 6am or 6pm—or both times if you like—but Shulman says there are some big benefits to morning strolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking first thing in the morning is really good to help set your circadian rhythm,” says Shulman, which she explains can promote better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2020/10000/consistent_morning_exercise_may_be_beneficial_for.7.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2020/10000/consistent_morning_exercise_may_be_beneficial_for.7.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;also tells us that people who typically exercise first thing in the morning are more likely to stick to their routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're struggling to be consistent with exercise, morning walks can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dVtPoWQ955kqfxzknrZq5Y" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dVtPoWQ955kqfxzknrZq5Y slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is also great for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, so it's good to do your walk before you sit down to start your working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't worry if you can only squeeze in a walk at 6pm, as that offers its own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An evening walk helps move digestion along, and reduces bloating,” Shulman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some people, but not all, it can help them sleep better that night. So, this idea of bookending your day with a walk is brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I walk both before and after work to shift myself from one part of my day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I allow the movement and time in nature to soothe my mind, so I'm ready for the next task—a helpful way to mentally shift gears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-many-steps-will-you-take-in-60-minutes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many steps will you take in 60 minutes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your stride length and pace will impact your 60 minute step count, so this will vary from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, a 60-minute walk tends to be about 5,500 to 6,000 steps, which gets me pretty close to a 10,000-step target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-the-benefit-of-warming-up-before-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's the benefit of warming up before exercise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're supposed to spend six minutes warming up, and six minutes cooling down, for this walking challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do any kind of movement you like for these periods (such as these &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dynamic-stretches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dynamic-stretches"&gt;dynamic stretches&lt;/a&gt;) but you can also simply slow your usual walking speed to a more leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmups and cooldowns allow your body to adjust to the change in activity level, which can improve your muscle flexibility, lubricate joints and potentially prevent post-exercise soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While walking isn’t generally considered to be intense exercise, I find these periods are also helpful for getting you in the right frame of mind for the gentle workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

It’s concerning that these chemicals are still being found in children’s mattresses even though we know they have no proven fire-safety benefit, and aren’t needed to comply with flammability standards.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers tested children's mattresses and found they contained concerningly high levels of toxins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalates are chemicals used to make products more flexible and able to withstand certain conditions, as well as help reduce cracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These substances are found in makeup, nail polish, hair spray, body lotion, shampoos and cleansers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They've been linked to infertility, breast cancer, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological complications and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While flame retardants are added to products to make them less flammable and can be in anything from clothing to furniture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been linked to an increased risk of brain damage, neurological development problems, lower IQ and attention, learning and behavioral disorders in children.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: 'Children are uniquely vulnerable to exposure, given that they are still developing, have hand-to-mouth behaviors, and have breathing rates ten times higher than adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They also have more permeable skin and three times the skin surface area relative to their body weight than adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the researchers discovered the high levels of toxins in children's mattresses, they tested the items again after simulating a child's body sleeping on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the simulated temperature and weight on the mattresses, emissions of the chemicals increased substantially - in some cases by several times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the products tested were purchased in Canada, most contained materials originating from other countries, including America and Mexico and the researchers said the results are likely to apply to mattresses purchased throughout North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Miriam Diamond, professor at the University of Toronto, said: 'Sleep is vital for brain development, particularly for infants and toddlers. However, our research suggests that many mattresses contain chemicals that can harm kids’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children’s beds are safe and support healthy brain development.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To reduce a child's exposure, the researchers recommend using undyed and neutral bedding, which is less likely to contain harmful chemicals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the levels of flame retardants found in the mattresses were 'puzzling' given the chemicals are not necessary to pass Canadian or US flammability standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result of their findings, the researchers are calling for manufacturers to be more vigilant about the chemicals they use in their products and for there to be stronger regulations on the use of these toxins in children's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, three types of phthalates are banned from use in children's items. The UK bans four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US also has loose restrictions when it comes to phthalates in food products, while the UK severely limits seven types of the substances in all food contact materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is no formal prohibition of phthalate use in American cosmetics, the UK either tightly controls or completely bans certain phthalates from cosmetic products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While regulations and manufacturers work to improve products, the team advised parents to take their own action, including decluttering a child's sleeping area of pillows, blankets and toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended washing and refreshing a child's bedding and pajamas, as well as only using undyed or neutral fabrics as those are less likely to contain toxic chemicals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the levels of flame retardants found in the mattresses were 'puzzling' given the chemicals are not necessary to pass Canadian or US flammability standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result of their findings, the researchers are calling for manufacturers to be more vigilant about the chemicals they use in their products and for there to be stronger regulations on the use of these toxins in children's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, three types of phthalates are banned from use in children's items. The UK bans four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US also has loose restrictions when it comes to phthalates in food products, while the UK severely limits seven types of the substances in all food contact materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is no formal prohibition of phthalate use in American cosmetics, the UK either tightly controls or completely bans certain phthalates from cosmetic products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While regulations and manufacturers work to improve products, the team advised parents to take their own action, including decluttering a child's sleeping area of pillows, blankets and toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended washing and refreshing a child's bedding and pajamas, as well as only using undyed or neutral fabrics as those are less likely to contain toxic chemicals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'If there's one thing you should know, it's that. She was failed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;escalating measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; gripping West Texas, where antivaccine conspiracy thinking has become rife and there has been an erosion of trust in public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death was confirmed to be from measles by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-2bef6a60-1964-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;). Hidlebrand, however, claims his daughter's death was not caused by the virus, but by a failure in her medical care, a lack of proper treatment and prejudice against their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family are Mennonite, part of a small Christian community that often emphasizes 'natural remedies' over modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to several locals, including young mothers, farmhands and truckers, in Seminole who were skeptical about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They falsely claimed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;the vaccines contained 'dangerous stuff'&lt;/a&gt; and that big pharma used them to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccine exemptions in Gaines County, where Seminole is based, are among the highest in the state and nationwide. About 13 percent of children attending local schools have a conscientious exemption for vaccines, compared to three percent nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seminole, Texas is at the center of a measles outbreak as antivaccine conspiracy thinking  becomes rife and trust in public institutions drops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Peter Hildebrand with his wife Eva and two of his children. They met with anti-vaccine crusader RFK Jr, health secretary, after the death of their daughter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the escalating measles outbreak gripping West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy, once a healthy and energetic child, got sick about a month ago. She came down with a fever, sore throat, and eventually pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family tried to treat their daughter at home with cod liver oil, popular in the community for helping to 'strengthen the immune system'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when that failed, they took her to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with strep throat, mononucleosis, a contagious viral infection, and measles. She was given antibiotics and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within three days, her condition worsened. Rushed back to the hospital with severe pneumonia, she was treated again — this time unsuccessfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy was the second child to die in the outbreak. Six-year-old Kayley Fehr, also unvaccinated and from the same Mennonite community, succumbed just weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They both mark the first deaths from measles in the US in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 700 cases of measles have been recorded nationwide so far this year, with 541 of these recorded in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number of cases is the worst since 2019 and is on track to become the worst in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Texas outbreak, 70 percent of cases - or more than two thirds - are among children and young babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though measles itself is viral, it weakens the immune system and leaves patients vulnerable to deadly secondary infections, especially pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mr Hildebrand rejects that explanation in Daisy’s case — and places little faith in the vaccines public health officials are urging the community to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [MMR] vaccine ain't worth a damn,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brother's family got it and they all still got sick — worse than my unvaccinated kids. This isn't about the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 93 percent effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97 percent effective after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joselyn doesn’t want to get her children vaccinated despite the outbreak because she claims to know people who’ve had adverse reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Judy said her family hasn’t got the MMR vaccine because they ‘don’t like the things in it’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without vaccination, however, there is a high risk of suffering from a measles infection - which is particularly dangerous in children under five years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In unvaccinated children, about one in five who are infected with measles are hospitalized, while one in 20 suffer from pneumonia, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in 1,000 will also develop encephalitis, a swelling on the brain that can lead to convulsions, going deaf and intellectual disability, and about one to three in every 1,000 die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mennonite community's relationship with vaccination is complicated. Though scripture doesn't strictly forbid vaccines, many in the community believe it should be a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 3,000 people in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures from 2010, out of the more than 22,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, Gaines County has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: just 82 percent of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine last year — far below the 95 percent threshold required for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the outbreak, hesitancy remains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At Healthy 2 U, a Mennonite-run supplement shop in Seminole, shelves are stocked with cod liver oil rich in vitamin A — an alternative therapy promoted by some vaccine skeptics as a natural defense against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend it to everyone who gets sick,' says store manager Nancy, a mother of 10 and grandmother of nineteen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are some who are still in favor of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a parking lot outside &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/walmart/index.html" id="mol-7b514a20-196d-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, DailyMail.com met two Mennonite women — Helen and Helena. One said she vaccinated her children, saying it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't vaccinate her children believing infections like measles 'make their immune system stronger'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Steven, a local designer, said everyone should get vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the entry-way to the measles testing and vaccination center in West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The town of Seminole, with just 7,000 residents, has been quietly grappling with the epidemic. Outside the local testing and vaccination clinic, DailyMail.com saw a slow trickle of patients — many coming for blood tests to determine if they have measles antibodies, a form of proof of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, many in the town are skeptical. Some believe the outbreak is slowing; others say they're hearing of 'more patients than ever'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local health director Zach Holbrooks says traffic to the clinic varies, with some days seeing no patients and others over a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urges vaccinations, calling them the best protection against hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs around town warn of the outbreak, but they're easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without large banners or public broadcasts, visitors may pass through Seminole and be completely unaware that the nation's worst measles outbreak in years is unfolding here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hildebrand is determined, however, to overturn the report that his daughter was killed by measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recently met with RFK Jr during a visit to the area earlier this month. 'He didn't mention vaccines once,' Mr Hildebrand says. 'But he was the nicest man I ever met.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his visit, RFK Jr wrote on X: 'The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Daisy was laid to rest alongside Kayley in a modest Mennonite churchyard, her father hopes her story sparks reflection — if not on vaccines, then on care, compassion, and the urgent need to protect the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was my little girl,' he says softly. 'And they let her down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Health officials in Hood River County confirmed Monday that two local deaths have been linked to a rare brain disease within the last eight months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, the county said, there have been one confirmed and two probable cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD, a prion disorder somewhat similar to the more commonly known "mad cow disease." So far, two of those cases have resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a very rare form of a dementia," explained Dr. Peter Pressman, a neurologist with OHSU's Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center. "Certain proteins called prions misfold and kind of cascade through the brain, causing damage as they go. This results in thinking difficulties, memory difficulties, movement problems and other symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known treatment for CJD, and cases tend to be fatal within a year. It's more likely to affect older adults, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and symptoms can include dementia, sudden jerky movements, trouble walking and visual disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's true, there's no cure, but we still offer help, as best we can, resources for patients and their families...trying first to ensure that it's not something else that is more treatable," Pressman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the risk of getting CJD is extremely low, Hood River health officials said, because it does not spread through the air, by touch, through social contact or the water supply.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike mad cow disease, CJD is not generally tied to infected meat, either — the vast majority of cases are "sporadic," the CDC says, which means they occur spontaneously in older adults. A smaller number of cases are caused by an inherited mutation, and an extremely small number of cases are contacted through health care settings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have found no identifiable link between the three Hood River County cases, but health officials are monitoring cases of the disease as required by state law. The investigation is being done in partnership with the Oregon Health Authority and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States sees between 500 and 600 cases of CJD each year, according to the CDC, or about one to two cases per one million people. Hood River County's population is just under 24,000 per the latest census data, so three cases would represent an outlier if confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've seen a number of these cases and they tend to hit hard because people who were very vibrant not so long ago, and sometimes at relatively young and productive times of life, just suddenly decompensate," said Pressman.

The virus is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14474859/gene-hackman-wife-betsy-arakawa-death-hantavirus-symptoms.html"&gt;rare in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with fewer than 50 cases reported yearly. For reference, there are roughly 2,000 cases of West Nile Virus reported in the US annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly because the US has fewer rodent species than Asian countries. Hantaviruses in the US primarily circulate in fewer rodent species compared to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-28cee9f0-1937-11f0-85d1-d5db88e7340b"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-c1b28bd0-1974-11f0-85f0-113a49f63e3e"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus circulates more widely than previously thought – detecting antibodies in six additional rodent species where hantavirus was not documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest that hantaviruses may circulate among a broader range of rodents, though human infection risk is still highest in areas with high deer mouse populations, especially in Southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Betsy Arakawa was found dead in the Santa Fe home she shared with her husband, Gene Hackman, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding their passing gripped the nation’s attention for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which kill around 50 percent of patients, are a group of viruses found worldwide and can cause deadly diseases with fatality rates comparable to serious illnesses like Ebola, which has a death rate ranging from about 60 to as much as 90 percent, depending on the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which are spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents, cause distinct diseases based on their geographic regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Asia, the Hantaan virus causes hemorrhagic fever with kidney disease, while in Europe, the same condition is linked to the Dobrava-Belgrade virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Americas, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by the Sin Nombre virus and the Andes virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sin Nombre virus was first identified in New Mexico in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They focused on how environmental factors and geographic patterns affect the rodent species that carry the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arakawa was infected with hantavirus which caused a deadly build-up of fluid in her lungs, known medically as hentavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hackman died of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These species showed the highest infection rates in their blood at three percent based on 116 positive samples, which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, researchers found that some rodent species, like Peromyscus truei and Microtus pennsylvanicus, had a higher percentage of hantavirus infections than deer mice – between 4.3 and 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paanwaris Paansri, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation and co-author of the study, said: ‘In North America, Peromyscus maniculatus, the deer mouse, is the most common carrier, but our study also revealed that other rodent species have a higher prevalence of hantavirus, which changes the current paradigm in hantavirus circulation in wildlife.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, these numbers can be misconstrued to pose a greater threat than actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are based on much smaller sample sizes: only nine out of 184 P. truei and 33 out of 768 M. pennsylvanicus tested positive. Meanwhile, 116 out of 3,919 deer mice were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the sample is small, even a few positive cases can skew the percentage to appear high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows hantavirus cases recorded in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of human cases are traced back to two or three key deer mouse species, and there is no evidence these species sustain outbreaks or significantly increase human risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, according to Mr Paansri, these findings reveal that the virus is more flexible than scientists once thought, broadening what they know about its basic biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia had the highest infection rate among rodents, with nearly eight percent of 99 samples testing positive for hantavirus – 3.8 times the national average of around two percent.&lt;/p&gt;

However, some forms are genetic or linked to contaminated beef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not spread from person-to-person unless in the case of infected transplanted organs, and Oregon officials do not know if the state's cases are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient was confirmed by autopsy to have died of CJD, while the other death is believed to be caused by CJD. State pathologists are examining brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, one of the two ways to diagnose CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rarely, a brain biopsy is performed to confirm the disease, which involves surgically removing brain tissue and often results in brain bleeding, infection, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third person suspected of having the disease is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trish Elliott, director of Hood River County Health Department, said: ‘We’re trying to look at any common risk factors that might link these cases … but it’s pretty hard in some cases to come up with what the real cause is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Panel B shows a section of the cerebral cortex where prions have killed white matter in the brain, creating lots of tiny holes, a pattern called “status spongiosis,” caused by severe nerve cell loss. Panel C shows severe damage in the deeper layer of white matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials declined to give personal details on the patients or say whether the three cases were from the same household or family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A variant of CJD has been tied to eating meat from cattle infected with mad cow disease, another prion disorder, but Elliott said the cases in Hood River are not believed to be linked to cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty-five percent of CJD cases are ‘sporadic,’ meaning they have no apparent cause or recognizable pattern of spreading, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 10 to 14 percent of CJD cases are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which encodes for the prion protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining one percent are caused by external factors, such as eating infected beef or undergoing medical procedures with infected tools or receiving transplanted organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically affects people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients usually die within four or five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are outliers, though. A 22-year-old college student &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2024.1518542/full"&gt;lived for seven months&lt;/a&gt; with progressively worsening dementia tied to CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prion diseases primarily affect people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previously high-functioning college student, she returned home from school and began experiencing severe anxiety, prompting treatment with benzodiazepines prescribed by a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, her symptoms worsened. She experienced hallucinations, sleepwalking, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also developed repetitive behaviors and became fixated on completing tasks like handwashing and toothbrushing in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She soon began to experience cognitive issues, including memory problems, trouble doing familiar tasks, and forgetting the names of close family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs, cerebral spinal fluid tests, and genetic testing to determine the cause and suspected it to be CJD. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t confirmed until the patient died, though, by examining brain tissue in the lab, spotting the sponge-like holes indicative of CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early signs of the disease include unexplained mood shifts, irritability, paranoia, delusions and other symptoms of psychosis, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the following weeks or months, CJD causes aggression, confusion, memory loss, inability to speak or eat, and incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hood River County Health Department did not disclose when the three cases first became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials issued a warning to local health workers to keep CJD in mind when they treat patients exhibiting signs of rapid descent into dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They maintain that the risk to the public is low.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:54:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>用于治疗阿尔茨海默氏症的尼古丁贴片-尼古丁能帮助您记住吗？ -人民药房 | Nicotine Patch for Alzheimer’s—Could Nicotine Help You Remember? - The People's Pharmacy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOU2RZa3Y0U0c1VEJlbHQyeEFOVWl1Ykc3SnZjQVpIa2R3ckt5VWpVNnBDcms5dEIyOG1idHVvSUdKREM4NUpuS3Z3RU1YcThBVkZaV2JOelRaOVhSSk5tQVhRZ1RWSDJNZ2Jlcy15TU9yRTNHZm53ai1ZQnVSTWJ3aEhob091Uk9Ta2JIcUo5SkZMQzZKSWs1NFR1cnNtcTRLV1VURW1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article_content__HD4YK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades researchers have considered nicotine a serious health problem. It is, after all, the addicting compound in cigarettes and other tobacco products. Humans have apparently been using tobacco as a drug for over 12,000 years (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34635825/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 2022&lt;/a&gt;). It has been smoked, snuffed and chewed. More recently, drug companies have created the nicotine patch. It is supposed to help people &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; smoking. Could it also help people who are suffering from Alzheimer disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Short History of Nicotine and Dementia:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1970s researchers were beginning to identify acetylcholine as a key problem in Alzheimer’s disease (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/589485/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Research&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 16, 1977&lt;/a&gt;). This critical neurotransmitter was deficient in the brains of patients with AD (Alzheimer’s disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Damage to the hippocampal formation, whether focal or diffuse, leads to severe impairment of short-term memory. The most common presenting symptom of Alzheimer disease is loss of short-term memory, and histologically the hippocampus is characteristically affected. Choline acetyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine, is depleted in the hippocampus in the disorder. Anticholinergic drugs administered to normal subjects can simulate some aspects of the memory defect seen in Alzheimer disease. It is postulated that damage to a cholinergic neuronal pathway running to or from the hippocampus underlies the memory disorder. This suggestion implies that it may be possible to improve memory in patients with Alzheimer disease by pharmacological means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did your eyes glaze over or did you grasp the meaning of that last sentence? These scientists were suggesting that you might be able to “improve memory” with drugs that somehow enhance cholinergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;They go on to state that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there is pharmacologic evidence that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is involved in memory processes in man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Nicotine stimulates acetylcholine receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What About a Nicotine Patch to Stimulate Cholinergic Receptors?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/smoking"&gt;Alzheimer’s Society&lt;/a&gt; has even gone so far as to ask this question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Can nicotine reduce dementia risk”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is some evidence that exposure to nicotine, which is one of the components of cigarette smoke, can actually reduce the risk of dementia. Such reports may be useful in indicating possible research directions for drug design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, nicotine intake through smoking would not be beneficial. Any positive effects would be outweighed by the significant harm caused by the other toxic components in cigarette smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to a recent question from a visitor to this website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Reader Asks About Using the Nicotine Patch for Dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; My brother is approaching 81 and is having difficulties with his memory. His doctor has prescribed donepezil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, investigation on drugs that help with dementia and Alzheimer’s is inconclusive. I have been reading more and more about the nicotine patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have great respect for your opinion. What are your thoughts about the nicotine patch? Are there any clinical trials that might establish effectiveness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a family history. Our mother and many of her siblings died from Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; You have asked a fascinating question. We have known for years that nicotine patches might have a beneficial effect on memory (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14534771/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here is the scientists’ introduction:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic transdermal nicotine has been found to improve attentional performance in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but little is known about chronic nicotine effects in age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), a milder form of cognitive dysfunction. The current study was performed to determine the clinical and neuropsychological effects of chronic transdermal nicotine in AAMI subjects over a 4-week period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a small study of people with age-associated memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions Regarding the Nicotine Patch:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic transdermal nicotine treatment in AAMI subjects caused a sustained improvement in clinical symptoms and objective computerized tests of attention. These results support the further investigation of nicotinic treatment as a promising therapy for AAMI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More Nicotine Patch Research:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;In 2013 Finnish researchers pointed out that (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24069634/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duodecim&lt;/em&gt;, 2013&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“even a noxious substance may possess beneficial properties”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They too reported that a nicotine patch could improve symptoms of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other pilot studies have reinforced some benefit from nicotine patch treatment (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22232050/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, Jan. 10, 2012&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study found that transdermal nicotine over 6 months is a safe treatment for nonsmoking subjects with MCI [mild cognitive impairment]. As this was a pilot clinical trial, we wanted to measure a broad number of cognitive and behavioral domains which might be influenced by nicotinic stimulation. Thus, it is not surprising that some measures showed no effect of treatment. However, measures of attentional, memory, and psychomotor performance did show an effect of nicotine and this finding provides strong justification for further treatment studies of nicotine for patients with early evidence of cognitive dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The MIND Clinical Trial:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been waiting a long time for a large nicotine patch study to be conducted. Let’s face it, the patch is a relatively inexpensive pharmaceutical product that can be purchased over the counter to help people quit smoking. Drug companies like big ticket products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first big study of nicotine patches for patients with mild cognitive impairment is called &lt;strong&gt;MIND&lt;/strong&gt; (Memory Improvement Through Nicotine Dosing). This clinical trial should be completed this year. We look forward to learning the results. When they are announced, we will do our best to make them available to you in a timely manner. Until then, though, we cannot recommend this approach. Anyone contemplating such an approach must discuss it with a physician. Nicotine could interact with other prescribed medications for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used the nicotine patch to quit smoking? Please share your experience in the comment section below.

The first symptom was that I couldn't wee – no matter how hard I tried and then, despite drinking water regularly, sitting in the bath for prolonged periods of time and listening to the sound of running water, I was unable to go," Gray told &lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;/em&gt;. "This went on for five days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray said they struggled to provide alternative solutions despite informing her doctors that laxatives were ineffective. "It was difficult to get doctors to believe me," she added. "They said that I must have been able to go to the toilet and that I was probably misremembering things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She experienced severe bladder pain as her condition worsened and returned to the doctor. Scans revealed her bladder contained a liter of urine, about four times its maximum capacity. Doctors inserted a catheter to relieve the pain, which Gray described as feeling like she was "being stabbed in the bladder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray made numerous hospital visits over the following months to relieve her bladder with a catheter, as she remained unable to urinate. After advocating for further tests, she was diagnosed with Fowler's syndrome in October 2019. This rare disorder affects the urethral sphincter, preventing it from relaxing and causing urinary retention, bladder spasms and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors informed Gray that her bladder showed no activity and would likely "never work normally again."

&lt;h2&gt;Uncertainty and balancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The estimates, while based on the best models available to the authors, are indirect, so there is considerable uncertainty about the estimates," Stephen Duffy, emeritus professor of Cancer Screening at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. "Thus, I would say to patients that if you are recommended to have a CT scan, it would be wise to do so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy also highlighted that in the context of a person's overall risk of cancer, CT scans don't move the needle much. There were a little over 100,000 cancers linked to 93 million scans. "This amounts to around a 0.1 percent increase in cancer risk over the patient's lifetime per CT examination," he said. The lifetime risk of cancer in the US population is &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html"&gt;around 40 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the additional risk from CT scans "is small." Overall, when a CT scan is deemed necessary, the "likely benefit in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of disease outweighs the very small increase in cancer risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doreen Lau, a cancer biology expert at Brunel University of London, agreed: "The findings don’t mean that people should avoid CT scans when recommended by a doctor. In most cases, the benefit of detecting or ruling out serious illness far outweighs the very small risk of harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rise in CT scans in recent years may suggest that doctors could cut back on their use. In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832782"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Ilana Richman of Yale University and Mitchell Katz of NYC Health and Hospitals discussed ways that doctors could make sure they're balancing risks and benefits before using CT scans, including using diagnostic algorithms and offering alternative imaging options, such as ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As with all complex problems, there will be no simple solution," they write. But, "educating clinicians about avoiding low-value testing and, in circumstances where alternatives are readily available, involving patients in the decision to do a CT scan may help shift culture and practice."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious disease. It's also extremely preventable. There's a vaccine. It's highly effective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For decades it has made measles outbreaks in the U.S. relatively rare, and measles deaths rarer still. But the U.S. has now seen more than&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5342706/texas-measles-outbreak-vaccine-seminole-gaines"&gt; 700 measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, and 3 deaths so far with active outbreaks across six states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The federal response is under scrutiny because Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has made a career spreading false information about vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are this administration's views on vaccines, and what do they mean for what is already one of the worst U.S. measles outbreaks this century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee"&gt;publicly promised &lt;/a&gt;he would support vaccines. Dr. Peter Marks, who was forced out as the nation's top vaccine regulator says his department isn't doing enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href="http://plus.npr.org/"&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org"&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Seeds are versatile and loaded with protein and other nutrients. Dietitians say you should eat more of them, whether you sprinkle them on salads or yogurt, blend them into a smoothie or just pop a handful into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeds are nutrient-rich powerhouses,” says &lt;a href="http://www.compassnutrition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adiana Castro;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Adiana Castro&lt;/a&gt;, M.S., R.D.N., a metabolic dietitian and owner of Compass Nutrition in New York City. “They are packed with protein, fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a61913712/vegan-and-vegetarian-protein-sources/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Plant-based proteins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt;, including seeds, “have a bonus effect because they contain both protein and fiber,” Castro says. These two nutrients promote blood sugar control, regulate appetite and amplify satiety to help you stay full longer. They’re also low in saturated fat and feed the good bacteria in the gut microbiome, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with packing a protein punch, seeds are generally rich in a range of vitamins and minerals, says &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/lena-beal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lena Bea&lt;/a&gt;l, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.

Unless you have a food allergy or sensitivity, most people can eat seeds every day, Castro says. She suggests aiming for 1 to 2 tablespoons a day to tap into their protein, healthy fat and fiber benefits. “A little goes a long way,” she says.&lt;strong&gt; However, excessive amounts of seeds — that is, more than 5 or 6 tablespoons a day consistently — could cause bloating, gas or constipation, Beal points out. &lt;/strong&gt;If you already have gut sensitivities or problems, pay attention to your seed intake. Seeds are also calorie-dense, which could contribute to weight gain if you eat too many, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Hearst Owned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to add seeds to your diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeds are incredibly versatile, Geiger says. “Because seeds are so small, they can be easily added to many dishes.” She suggests sprinkling them on top of avocado toast, using ground flaxseeds as an egg replacement in baking or blending chia seeds into a smoothie. Stir chia or flax seeds into oatmeal overnight oats, top yogurt or smoothies with hemp seeds or sprinkle sunflower or other seeds on salads, grain bowls or fruit, Beal says.

 &lt;p id="why-it-matters"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Clean water is essential, but some pollutants are notoriously tricky to remove. Scientists have developed a breakthrough filtration process using 2D materials and sugar-based chemistry to trap persistent contaminants. Engineers can customize the technology to target specific molecules, offering a scalable solution for safer water worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
 
 
 
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Monash University have introduced a new water filtration technology that could shift the fight against PFAS – chemicals known for their environmental persistence and health risks. Found in products like waterproof clothing and firefighting foams, PFAS are notoriously hard to break down. Traditional treatment methods often fail, especially against the smallest PFAS molecules, which slip through filters and accumulate in ecosystems and human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monash team &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/new-monash-designed-water-filter-removes-stubborn-forever-chemicals"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; a graphene oxide membrane derived from graphite and enhanced it with beta-cyclodextrin, a ring-shaped sugar molecule. The pairing is intentional as beta-cyclodextrin can trap chemical compounds inside its ring-like structure, acting as a molecular cage. The researchers created a highly selective network of nanoscale channels by integrating beta-cyclodextrin into the graphene oxide membrane. These channels act as energy barriers, blocking PFAS molecules – including the elusive short-chain types – while allowing water to flow through efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Eubert Mahofa said the membrane's design overcomes a major challenge in water purification – balancing the removal of tiny, persistent contaminants with maintaining a fast flow of clean water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="tsadinc"&gt;"Our approach solves this by filtering out and concentrating these harmful chemicals while still allowing water to flow through efficiently," Mahofa said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="tsadinc"&gt;The membrane's performance remains stable even as water temperature changes, which is essential for real-world applications where conditions can vary. The manufacturing method, known as shear alignment printing, is efficient and scalable, enabling the production of large membrane sheets suited for municipal water treatment plants, industrial facilities, and environmental cleanup efforts.&lt;/p&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;Co-researcher Dr. Sally El Meragawi emphasized that the membrane removes harmful chemicals while preserving essential minerals and nutrients. This ability makes it suitable for drinking water and wastewater treatment, ensuring the water remains safe and healthy for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="tsadinc"&gt;What sets this technology apart is its adaptability. Researchers can modify the chemical structure of beta-cyclodextrin to target a wide range of pollutants, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and heavy metals. Professor Mainak Majumder, who leads the Australian Research Council's Research Hub for Advanced Manufacturing with 2D Materials, explained that this approach could pave the way for a new generation of customizable water filters, each designed to target specific contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="tsadinc"&gt;Monash University, Clean TeQ Water, and NematiQ – a company specializing in graphene-based technologies – collaborated over several years to develop this breakthrough process.&lt;/p&gt;

Cording says this is one of the most common signs that you're not having enough protein. Protein helps you to feel full, and if you're not getting enough, you may end up hungry again pretty soon after you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If someone is constantly hungry, I’m always going to check to make sure they have enough protein,” Cording says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-cuts-and-scrapes-take-a-while-to-heal" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;2) Your cuts and scrapes take a while to heal. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Protein is essential for wound-healing because it provides the basis for building new tissue and collagen, which are needed for your body’s repair and growth, Cording explains. “Sometimes when you don’t eat enough protein, your body doesn’t repair as well,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-not-building-muscle" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;3) You’re not building muscle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Yep, even if you're going hard on the weights, a diet that lacks protein means you won't really see much improvement in muscle mass. Of course, you won’t build muscle by eating protein alone, but if you're running into this issue, Cording says to reassess your protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you struggle to meet their daily protein needs within your regular meals, you can also opt for a protein powder to give yourself a little boost.

But if you feel like there’s no obvious reason for your hair loss, protein could be a culprit, according to &lt;a href="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gary Goldenberg" data-node-id="18.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Hair follicles are constantly cycling through growth (anagen), transition (catagen), and resting (telogen) phases,” he explains. “Proteins are needed to support this constant turn over.” If you don’t have enough protein, new healthy anagen follicles can’t be produced—and you can end up losing hair, Dr. Goldenberg says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Of course, upping your protein intake isn't always a magic solution. “While in most [people] this process can be repaired by an increase in protein intake, in some patients it can become chronic and long term,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-nails-are-brittle" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;5) Your nails are brittle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64312856/minoxidil-nail-growth/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64312856/minoxidil-nail-growth/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nails" data-node-id="22.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Nails&lt;/a&gt; are mostly made of keratin, which is a form of protein. When there’s not enough protein in your diet, you can’t make and produce enough keratin, leading to brittle nails, Goldenberg says. Cue the dry and fragile nails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Of course, calcium, vitamin C, biotin (vitamin B7), and vitamin E are &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43099664/how-to-strengthen-nails/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43099664/how-to-strengthen-nails/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="key players here, too" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;key players here, too&lt;/a&gt;.

That’s why Cording recommends starting small if you suspect you’re not having enough of the macronutrient right now. “Increase it in an approachable way,” she says. “That might mean having a slightly larger portion of Greek yogurt, adding cottage cheese to your scrambled eggs, or adding a scoop of collagen powder to your coffee. That can add up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Gans recommends starting your day with protein to kick things off the right way. “Don't skimp on protein at breakfast,” she says. “Include good protein sources such eggs, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, tofu, or smoked salmon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; also has all kinds of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g64341662/best-cottage-cheese-recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g64341662/best-cottage-cheese-recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein-packed recipes" data-node-id="28.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;protein-packed recipes&lt;/a&gt; for you to peruse.

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Eating more potassium-rich foods can help lower blood pressure. (Lucigerma/Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potassium can lower blood pressure, even on a salty diet. Simulations showed that increasing potassium intake significantly reduced blood pressure, even when sodium levels stayed high, with drops of up to 14 mmHg in men and 10 mmHg in women.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Men and women respond differently to potassium. The models revealed that female kidneys handle sodium differently, offering natural protection against high blood pressure, while men showed a stronger blood pressure response to dietary potassium.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Balancing potassium and sodium may matter more than cutting salt alone. The study suggests that boosting potassium-rich foods like leafy greens, beans, and sweet potatoes could be a powerful, underused strategy for managing blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATERLOO, Canada — &lt;/strong&gt;Want to lower your blood pressure? Skip the salt shaker and reach for a banana instead. A new study reveals that boosting your potassium intake might be a powerful way to combat high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Waterloo in Canada found that high-potassium diets can significantly reduce blood pressure, even when you’re still consuming a fair amount of salt. This study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajprenal.00222.2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, challenges what we’ve long believed about managing hypertension and suggests potassium deserves more attention in our dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/years-of-high-blood-pressure-stroke-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; affects millions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of heart disease and premature death. Its prevalence has been climbing in recent years, thanks in part to our aging population and lifestyle changes, particularly our love affair with processed foods that are typically loaded with salt but lacking in potassium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-potassium-fights-high-blood-pressure"&gt;How Potassium Fights High Blood Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using computer simulations showing hypertension scenarios, researchers found that doubling &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/blood-pressure-fruits-vegetables-potassium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potassium intake&lt;/a&gt; reduced blood pressure by up to 14 mmHg in men and 10 mmHg in women. To put that in perspective, many blood pressure medications aim to reduce readings by similar amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potassium’s beneficial effects continued even when &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/salty-food-depression-sodium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;salt consumption&lt;/a&gt; remained high. This suggests that you might be able to partially offset the harmful effects of that salty pizza or bag of chips by making sure you’re also eating plenty of potassium-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of testing these theories on human subjects, the researchers built complex mathematical models that simulate how the body responds to different mineral intakes. These computer models captured the intricate dance between the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, nervous system, and hormones involved in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; regulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that women typically have lower blood pressure than men of the same age before &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/menopause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, and these simulations helped identify why that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that women’s reduced response to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/do-you-have-hypertension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension triggers&lt;/a&gt;, including high salt intake, appears to be largely because of the different way female kidneys transport sodium, giving women some natural protection against blood pressure spikes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the short term, when you consume &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/calcium-potassium-kidney-stones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, your digestive system sends immediate signals to your kidneys before your blood potassium levels even change. This “feedforward” system triggers increased potassium excretion in urine, helping prevent dangerous spikes in blood potassium.&lt;/p&gt;

(New Africa/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, high potassium intake causes your kidneys to decrease sodium reabsorption in multiple parts of their filtering units. This leads to greater sodium excretion, reducing fluid volume in your blood vessels and consequently lowering blood pressure. This explains why potassium can help offset the effects of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/enjoy-salty-diet-eating-cheese-may-protect-blood-vessels-from-sodium-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-sodium diets&lt;/a&gt;: it essentially helps your body eliminate more sodium through urine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-your-diet-for-heart-health"&gt;Balancing Your Diet for Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loading up on potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/spinach-make-muscles-stronger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;, avocados, and white beans could be a simple dietary approach to help keep your blood pressure in check. The ratio of potassium to sodium might matter more than your total sodium intake alone, emphasizing the importance of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, because men and women respond differently to dietary changes and potentially to blood pressure medications, doctors might need more personalized approaches when treating &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hypertension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, consuming more fruits and vegetables while limiting processed foods is a great first step. The potassium-rich diets our ancestors ate likely protected them from hypertension, even with relatively high salt intake, a balance that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/diet-change-live-10-years-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;modern eating habits&lt;/a&gt; have increasingly disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers created sex-specific computer models to simulate how sodium, potassium, and fluid balance affect blood pressure throughout the body. These models accounted for known biological differences between males and females, including kidney function, hormone levels, nervous system activity, and blood vessel responses. The models captured interactions among the kidneys, heart, digestive system, and various regulatory systems. They then ran simulations with different combinations of sodium intake, potassium intake, and various types of hypertension to see how these factors affect blood pressure differently in men versus women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simulations showed that high sodium intake raised blood pressure in both sexes, but the effect was smaller in females. When potassium intake was doubled, blood pressure decreased significantly—by up to 14 mmHg in males and 10 mmHg in females with certain types of hypertension. Notably, higher potassium intake counteracted the blood pressure-raising effects of high sodium intake. Women’s different kidney transporter pattern appeared largely responsible for their protection against hypertension, as they reabsorb less sodium in the early parts of the kidney filtering system. High potassium intake triggered several kidney adaptations that lowered blood pressure, including reduced sodium reabsorption in both early and later portions of the kidney tubules, increasing sodium excretion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used computer models rather than actual human subjects, and had to extrapolate some sex-specific parameters from rat studies due to limited human data. The models represent normal blood pressure or mild hypertension conditions and may not apply to severe hypertension. The researchers acknowledged their representation of the hormone system involved in blood pressure regulation was simplified, potentially underestimating sex differences. Additionally, the models didn’t explicitly account for nitric oxide or oxidative stress, which show sex differences and play important roles in blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

Developed by researchers who altered just two atoms in LSD’s structure, JRT maintains the psychedelic’s neuroplastic effects while avoiding its psychosis-linked risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, JRT enhanced synaptic growth, boosted antidepressant effects, and improved cognitive flexibility—key challenges in schizophrenia treatment. These findings support the idea that psychedelics can be safely reengineered to unlock brain repair without perceptual side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Neuroplasticity:&lt;/strong&gt; JRT increased dendritic spine density by 46% and synapse density by 18%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Hallucinogenic Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike LSD, JRT did not produce hallucinogenic behavior or schizophrenia-linked gene expression in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potent Antidepressant:&lt;/strong&gt; JRT demonstrated antidepressant effects 100 times more potent than ketamine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of California, Davis researchers have developed a new, neuroplasticity-promoting drug closely related to LSD that harnesses the psychedelic’s therapeutic power with reduced hallucinogenic potential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,&lt;/em&gt; highlights the new drug’s potential as a treatment option for conditions like schizophrenia, where psychedelics are not prescribed for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound also may be useful for treating other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by synaptic loss and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108750"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a head and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;JRT exhibited powerful neuroplastic effects and improved measures in mice relevant to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, without exacerbating behaviors and gene expression associated with psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To design the drug, dubbed JRT, researchers flipped the position of just two atoms in LSD’s molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical flip reduced JRT’s hallucinogenic potential while maintaining its neurotherapeutic properties, including its ability to spur neuronal growth and repair damaged neuronal connections that are often observed in the brains of those with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, what we did here is a tire rotation,” said corresponding author David E. Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics and a professor of chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By just transposing two atoms in LSD, we significantly improved JRT’s selectivity profile and reduced its hallucinogenic potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JRT exhibited powerful neuroplastic effects and improved measures in mice relevant to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, without exacerbating behaviors and gene expression associated with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one really wants to give a hallucinogenic molecule like LSD to a patient with schizophrenia,” said Olson, who is also co-founder and chief innovation officer of Delix Therapeutics, a company that aims to bring neuroplastogens to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The development of JRT emphasizes that we can use psychedelics like LSD as starting points to make better medicines. We may be able to create medications that can be used in patient populations where psychedelic use is precluded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing JRT’s potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson said that it took his team nearly five years to complete the 12-step synthesis process to produce JRT. The molecule was named after Jeremy R. Tuck, a former graduate student in Olson’s laboratory, who was the first to synthesize it and is a co-first author of the study along with Lee E. Dunlap, another former graduate student in Olson’s laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following JRT’s successful synthesis, the researchers conducted a battery of cellular and mouse assays that demonstrated the drug’s neuroplastic effects and improved safety profile relative to LSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT and LSD have the exact same molecular weight and overall shape, but distinct pharmacological properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT is very potent and highly selective for binding to serotonin receptors, specifically 5-HT2A receptors, the activation of which are key to promoting cortical neuron growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT promoted neuroplasticity, or growth between cellular connections in the brain, leading to a 46% increase in dendritic spine density and an 18% increase in synapse density in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT did not produce hallucinogenic-like behaviors that are typically seen when mice are dosed with LSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT did not promote gene expression associated with schizophrenia. Such gene expression is typically amplified with LSD use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT produced robust anti-depressant effects, with it being around 100-fold more potent than ketamine, the state-of-the-art fast-acting anti-depressant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT promoted cognitive flexibility, successfully addressing deficits in reversal learning that are associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JRT has extremely high therapeutic potential. Right now, we are testing it in other disease models, improving its synthesis, and creating new analogues of JRT that might be even better,” Olson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more effective treatment for schizophrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson emphasized JRT’s potential for treating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, as most current treatments produce limited effects on anhedonia — the inability to feel pleasure — and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clozapine is the one exception, but it has side effects, and is not first-line drug of choice for people severely afflicted with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson and his team are currently testing JRT’s potential against other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional coauthors include Yara A.

A large-scale meta-analysis of over 400,000 participants revealed that digital engagement correlates with a 58% lower risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology challenges the brain, fosters social connection, and enables compensatory tools like reminders and GPS that support independence.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt; by neuroscientists at Baylor University and the University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School reveals the opposite – digital technologies are actually associated with &lt;em&gt;reduced &lt;/em&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study – &lt;em&gt;A meta-analysis of technology use and cognitive aging&lt;/em&gt; – was sparked by the ongoing concern about the passive activity of digital technologies and their relation to accelerating risks of dementia. Study co-authors are Jared F. Benge, Ph.D., clinical neuropsychologist and associate professor of neurology at Dell Medical School and UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center within the Mulva Clinic for the Neurosciences, and Michael K. Scullin, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can flip on the news on just about any day and you’ll see people talking about how technologies are harming us,” Scullin said. “People often use the terms ‘brain drain’ and ‘brain rot,’ and now digital dementia is an emerging phrase. As researchers, we wanted to know if this was true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “digital dementia” hypothesis predicts that a lifetime of exposure to digital technology will worsen cognitive abilities. On the contrary, the study’s findings challenge this hypothesis, indicating instead that engagement with digital technology fosters cognitive resilience in these adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing more than 136 studies with data that encompassed over 400,000 adults, and longitudinal studies with an average of 6 years of follow-up data, Scullin and Benge found compelling evidence that digital technology use is associated with better cognitive aging outcomes, rather than harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ study supported the “technological reserve” hypothesis, finding that digital technologies can promote behaviors that preserve cognition. In fact, their study revealed that digital technology use correlates with a 58% lower risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern of cognitive protection persisted when the researchers controlled for socioeconomic status, education, age, gender, baseline cognitive ability, social support, overall health, and engagement with mental activities like reading that might have explained the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase in problem-solving skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scullin said that for some, these findings are surprising as technology use is often associated with being sedentary both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for the current generation of older adults who were introduced to the first technological advancements – computers, the Internet and smartphones – past their childhood, using technology is cognitively challenging because it is everchanging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the first things that middle-age and older adults were saying is that ‘I’m so frustrated by this computer. This is hard to learn.’ That’s actually a reflection of the cognitive challenge, which may be beneficial for the brain even if it doesn’t feel great in the moment.” Scullin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology requires constant adaption, he said, such as understanding new software updates, troubleshooting Internet loss or filtering out website ads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re doing that for years and you’re really engaging with it, even though you might experience frustration, that may be a sign of you exercising your brain,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology also enables communication and engagement like never before, which can expand opportunities for connectivity. Video calls, emails and messaging apps help maintain social networks, especially for people who would not otherwise regularly see their family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now you can connect with families across generations,” Scullin said. “You not only can talk to them, you can see them. You can share pictures. You can exchange emails and it’s all within a second or less. So that means there’s a greater opportunity for decreasing loneliness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better social connectedness is a well-documented correlate of cognitive functioning in older adults, providing a link between decreased isolation from digital technologies and reduced risks of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of “digital scaffolding”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dementia diagnosis is indicated in part when cognitive changes lead to a loss of independence with daily tasks. Tools such as digital reminders, GPS navigation and online banking allow older adults to remain independent despite cognitive difficulties through digital scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research article, this digital scaffold “facilitates better functional outcomes in older adults while general cognitive functioning declines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technologies can serve as a compensatory support system to maintain general independence and reduce the risk of a dementia diagnosis even with the presence of some cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As clinical practice continues to move toward an individualized, precision-medicine approach, it will be necessary for the field to identify for whom and for how long, such digital scaffolding is effective,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting healthy technology use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Scullin recognizes the negative effects of technology, such as distracted driving or using technology over consistent face-to-face interaction, he also emphasizes how promoting a healthy use of digital tools in older adults is beneficial for their cognitive health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a parent or grandparent who’s just staying away from technology, maybe revisit that. Could they learn to use photo, messaging, or calendar apps on a smartphone or tablet? Start simple and be very patient while they learn,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media use is another highly debated topic in terms of cognitive effects. While he says it’s hard to predict the cognitive effects of endlessly scrolling on TikTok, Scullin does argue that generating videos through creative cognition could be beneficial. In addition, he said that interacting with communities online can provide benefits by forming social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could spend a long time talking about all the specific ways in which technology use can be bad. However, the net effect since the 1990s has been positive for overall cognition in older adults,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (R01AG082783; M.K.S., J.F.B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#611209040d03183e020407001300151508210300180d0e134f040514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelby Cefaratti-Bertin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baylor.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelby Cefaratti-Bertin – Baylor College of Medicine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02159-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A meta-analysis of technology use and cognitive aging&lt;/a&gt;” by Jared F.

Has technological exposure helped or harmed cognition in digital pioneers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The digital dementia hypothesis predicts that a lifetime of technology exposure worsens cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative hypothesis is that such exposures lead to technological reserve, wherein digital technologies promote behaviours that preserve cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested these hypotheses in a meta-analysis and systematic review of studies published in Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were observational or cohort studies focused on general digital technology use in older adults (over age 50) and included either a cognitive or dementia diagnosis outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 136 papers that met inclusion criteria, of which 57 were compatible with odds ratio or hazard ratio meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies included 411,430 adults (baseline age M = 68.7 years; 53.5% female) from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies (range: 1–18 years, M = 6.2 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of digital technologies was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.35–0.52) and reduced time-dependent rates of cognitive decline (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.84). Effects remained significant when accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, health and cognitive reserve proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All studies were evaluated for quality on the basis of a standardized checklist; the primary outcomes replicated when limiting analyses to the highest-quality studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work is needed to test bidirectional causal interpretations, understand mechanisms that underpin technological reserve, and identify how types and timings of technology exposures influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:53:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBEZ2Z6SnpfeGxuVWV6Q1k3N1cyaHFGeGJTeC04WDVRMjJIQ2M4bEVTcHFHNlU3dy1ONXZMQTFoRi1ySkhCcmhtNWlzaDZFcnptT1pQck9kQjR4SnFLLV8xeDRxSllGRFdn</guid></item><item><title>在美国奶牛和家禽中发现更多H5N1 ；世卫组织发布H5监测指南- CIDRAP | More H5N1 detections in US dairy cows and poultry; WHO unveils H5 surveillance guide - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxQOHVNWGV1QXhQNGhjM2JkTmV6RF8tdmdScmRQcE1SN2U4QUFxZjVGbjNWRDJBa2FoVjBNT3p1X0dtcXFkcm85YlNoaTNMemlOLVcxdFRQWFBFYUxVM0hDY2VSdWFtUWd3dDY3bXQxdWw4V2E4a3k5N0o0bERSZWRXY2YtSUNTcnN2UnV3ZDVGX3FjY1otMWh5ZXFSdm0yMlY2M25BTENzdjN6bUxRVmFBSDJ1N25Ed1RNSUw3Z2RqV3BrVWFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many cases of tuberculosis (TB) in prisons in Europe and the Americas during the COVID-19 pandemic were likely missed, putting both inmates and the community at risk for the deadly bacterial disease, Boston University (BU)-led researchers propose in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00325-6/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team analyzed data from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Pan American Health Organization (PAHO; 22 of 39 countries) and WHO Europe (25 of 53 countries) to model and predict prison populations and TB infections among 4.9 million inmates from 2020 to 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Case notifications fall up to 100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TB notifications in prisons were much lower than predicted in 2020 (-26.2%), 2021 (-46.4%), and 2022 (-48.9%). These trends were consistent across Europe and the Americas, but larger drops occurred in countries with lower TB rates (low burden) in 2020 (-54.8%) and 2021 (-68.4%), high-burden settings in 2021 (-89.4%), and Central and North America in 2021 (-100.3%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reasons for this change in tuberculosis notifications might be multifactorial and include missed diagnoses and implementation of COVID-19 pandemic measures, reducing transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incarceration rates were similar to predicted levels (under 10% overall difference) during the entire pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Reasons for this change in tuberculosis notifications might be multifactorial and include missed diagnoses and implementation of COVID-19 pandemic measures, reducing transmission," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a BU &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078853"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, first author Amy Zheng, MPH, a PhD student, said, "When countries are unable to detect tuberculosis in high-risk populations—such as people who are incarcerated—it increases the risk of transmission, both within prisons and to the broader community, when people are released from prison."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a related &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00012-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Emma Plugge, MD, PhD, of the University of Southampton in England, and Nicola Cocco, MD, of ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo in Milan, Italy, said that while prisons released some inmates to slow COVID-19 transmission, the efforts were inconsistent across countries and didn't result in meaningful population decreases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Efforts to tackle tuberculosis inside prisons must be redoubled as they have outside," they wrote. "Such actions will have a positive effect on the whole community; no one is safe until we are all safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers studied individuals with Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare condition that selectively damages the BLA, using economic games to assess generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While patients were just as generous as controls toward close friends, they were significantly more selfish toward strangers and acquaintances. These findings suggest that the BLA doesn’t create prosocial behavior, but regulates when and how it occurs depending on social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of the BLA:&lt;/strong&gt; The basolateral amygdala helps adjust generosity depending on emotional closeness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urbach-Wiethe Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with BLA damage were less generous toward distant social contacts but acted normally with close friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Calibration:&lt;/strong&gt; The BLA doesn’t drive altruism but fine-tunes prosocial responses based on relationship strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there areas of the brain, which regulate prosocial, altruistic behaviour? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with colleagues from the universities in Lausanne, Utrecht and Cape Town, researchers from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) have studied a very special group of patients and established that the “basolateral amygdala” (part of the limbic system) plays an important role in this. In the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;), they describe that this region calibrates social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108742"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This disease causes selective damage to the so-called basolateral amygdala (for short: BLA) without impacting other areas of the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosocial behaviour, i.e. helping others, is a cornerstone of human interaction. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms that determine this behaviour vis-à-vis different social constellations are not yet fully understood, so the question remains: How does prosocial behaviour change depending on how much, or little, decision-makers care about each other emotionally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researching this objectively is no easy task. However, a special research environment presented itself in South Africa. Professor Dr Tobias Kalenscher, head of the “Comparative Psychology” research team at HHU and lead author of the study in PNAS: “It was a unique opportunity to work on site with a group of patients who suffer from the extremely rare ‘Urbach-Wiethe Disease’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease causes selective damage to the so-called basolateral amygdala (for short: BLA) without impacting other areas of the brain. The emotional life and social behaviour of Urbach-Wiethe subjects differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, they find it difficult to recognise the emotional meaning of facial expressions. There are less than 150 known cases worldwide, but a larger group of Urbach-Wiethe subjects lives in Namaqualand in northern South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patients represent a quasi-natural experimental environment for questions about prosocial behaviour,” adds Professor Kalenscher. “In the case of these individuals, exactly those areas of the brain are affected, which are believed to play a key role in compassionate behaviour toward others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and South Africa conducted so-called “dictator games” with the study participants – a special constellation from game theory in which the participants are asked to distribute sums of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were allowed to decide how much money they wanted to share with other people – close friends, acquaintances, neighbours or strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luca M. Lüpken, co-author of the study and doctoral researcher at HHU: “The results were clear: Individuals with BLA damage were just as generous toward people they were close to as healthy control participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, as soon as it came to individuals with whom they had less of an emotional connection, they were notably more selfish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors therefore conclude that the BLA is not fundamentally necessary for altruism, but that it helps regulate the degree of generosity depending on the social distance between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this form of calibration is missing, the natural tendency to prioritise personal well-being over that of others dominates, meaning that affected individuals tend to act more selfishly. Only a strong emotional attachment – like that between best friends – brings about greater generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lüpken: “Our study shows that the amygdala does not generally promote or inhibit prosocial behaviour, but rather regulates when and to what extent we act in a prosocial way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings explain the biological foundations for human social behaviour. They can also be important for gaining a better understanding of other conditions such as autism or psychopathy where social decisions are often different from those of healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kalenscher places the findings in a wider context: “Social decisions are not only shaped by our upbringing or culture. They are in fact also strongly anchored in the mechanisms of our brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the future, it may be possible to develop targeted therapies to help individuals with social behaviour issues regulate their decision-making processes better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#08697a666d266b64697d7b7b6d664860607d266c6d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arne Claussen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhu.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Arne Claussen – HHU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:26:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE13amNmTjdORm14LVNyQlhJTVV3VElIQWg5enRvREZTSFFJWGZzN1Y1V0VCcnU3UDlkZ2dLZmhIM1dKUEdqeGx1TXU3WlRid2J3bzBLeEhIeGNfc0dIZl9YYXpjVmtfVHNSTDBV</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员：在阿米蒂维尔发现狂犬病检测呈阳性的死浣熊-新闻12 | Health officials: Dead raccoon found in Amityville tests positive for rabies - News 12</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOSzlPMGF4LXNxMHpGMElXMHQ1SHh3VGVBSmF1LVJROXlkRm5BQ3IzN3JOSW9xMTBQS3BuWTRTejhsT1VWXzAzbHY2V1ZLaDVwNjdpWlhLNzhPWFJWZFJGZFF4ZFhHRjUweFVCWDVCendPTEpOclF3ZUtIZk1scXdvRk9PdHNzU1FJTUtHb192dUdpbkRxWHVwd1pWaWNJQ3M0TjVnTmNWU1Q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;A dead raccoon found in Amityville has tested positive for rabies, according to the Suffolk County Department of Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that changes in gut-derived metabolites are linked to differences in brain structure and function in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gut-brain communication appears to impact emotional processing and social behaviors, shedding light on why gastrointestinal issues are so common in autism.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery raises the possibility of new treatment avenues. It’s an example of how research at USC, and other universities, drives innovation and leads to discoveries that improve lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior. Essentially, the brain acts as the intermediary between gut health and autism-related behaviors,” said first author Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, a professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies highlighted differences in gut microbiomes and brain structures in autism, but our research connects the dots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain connection is not as far-fetched as it might seem. From an evolutionary perspective, the gut was likely the first “brain,” explained Aziz-Zadeh, who also is a professor at USC Dornsife’s Department of Psychology and the USC Mrs. T.H. Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the neurons from the gut send signals to the brain; there are actually more neurons in the gut than in the spinal cord. About 90% of the neural signals between the gut and brain travel from the gut to the brain, while only 10% go in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Gut instinct’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant communication explains why we talk about “gut instinct” or “feeling it in your gut.” Many emotions are processed through gut-related mechanisms, a concept known as interoception — the perception of internal bodily sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected behavioral data, brain imaging data and stool samples from 43 children with autism and 41 neurotypical children aged 8-17. From the stool samples, they analyzed metabolites produced by gut bacteria that break down food in the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then correlated these metabolites with brain differences observed in children with autism and their behavioral characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They homed in on the “tryptophan pathway” by which tryptophan, an amino acid found in many foods, is broken down into several metabolites, including serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is crucial for emotional processing, social interaction, learning and other brain functions. Since much of the body’s serotonin originates in the gut microbiome, changes in gut health can influence serotonin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children,” Aziz-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofronia Ringold, a doctoral student at the Brain and Creativity Institute who worked on the study, said she was excited by the possibility of interventions that might target the gut and influence neural activity and behavior “while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to Aziz-Zadeh and Ringold, other authors of the study are Aditya Jayashankar, Emily Kilroy, Ravi Bhatt, and Christiana Butera of USC; and Jonathan Jacobs, Skylar Tanartkit, Swapna Joshi, Mirella Dapretto, Jennifer Labus, and Emeran Mayer, all of UCLA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01HD079432) and a grant from the Department of Defense’s Idea Development Award (AR170062).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/tag/leigh-hopper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leigh Hopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Hopper – USC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Relationships between brain activity, tryptophan-related gut metabolites, and autism symptomatology&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships between brain activity, tryptophan-related gut metabolites, and autism symptomatology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has been suggested that alterations in the composition of gut microbial metabolites may play a causative role in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is not known how gut microbial metabolites are associated with ASD-specific brain alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional, case-control observational study, (i) fecal metabolomics, (ii) task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and (iii) behavioral assessments were obtained from 43 ASD and 41 neurotypical (NT) children, aged 8–17. The fMRI tasks used socio-emotional and sensory paradigms that commonly reveal strong evoked brain differences in ASD participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that fecal levels of specific tryptophan-related metabolites, including kynurenate, were significantly lower in ASD compared to NT, and were associated with: 1) alterations in insular and cingulate cortical activity previously implicated in ASD; and 2) ASD severity and symptoms (e.g., ADOS scores, disgust propensity, and sensory sensitivities).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, activity in the mid-insula and mid-cingulate significantly mediated relationships between the microbial tryptophan metabolites (indolelactate and tryptophan betaine) and ASD severity and disgust sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we identify associations between gut microbial tryptophan metabolites, ASD symptoms, and brain activity in humans, particularly in brain regions associated with interoceptive processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:08:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE14ODdnb3JzYXJsYmY3X3VkNEtuSHRKS1FRSGp6SDd1dnVOTFBQTzFiSmxod2RBYmlXV0VVcXlfeDZZMmlQeVVMZE1ZYkg1b0o2UXZlcWNWOWRnQ0RVTFQzamVmUQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家在LSD中翻转两个原子–并解锁改变游戏规则的心理健康治疗- SciTechDaily | Scientists Flip Two Atoms in LSD – And Unlock a Game-Changing Mental Health Treatment - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPT080N29pRE1BZklJX1Zfbmhkei1jeUVNOWxKeVhTM3VnT3daSzZIa3gyajBfeFRFNjJsbkRtdWN4ZndWVnBFdmNPTWVJVFUtcDNnRHgwbTRPX2h5Z0ZPNWhwNGxuVmR4YkNxRU55MHd2Qlo1dnZaRENVQnNDdTRBMVZodk8wWFd4Z182VnFWbnpZMWM5RVJmR0FMSDZVR1FNTGpDQzlDLVZKeHRuZ2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:00:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPT080N29pRE1BZklJX1Zfbmhkei1jeUVNOWxKeVhTM3VnT3daSzZIa3gyajBfeFRFNjJsbkRtdWN4ZndWVnBFdmNPTWVJVFUtcDNnRHgwbTRPX2h5Z0ZPNWhwNGxuVmR4YkNxRU55MHd2Qlo1dnZaRENVQnNDdTRBMVZodk8wWFd4Z182VnFWbnpZMWM5RVJmR0FMSDZVR1FNTGpDQzlDLVZKeHRuZ2c</guid></item><item><title>寻求大麻使用护理的老年人患痴呆症的风险更高-《纽约时报》 | Older People Seeking Care for Cannabis Use at Greater Risk for Dementia - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFAtSjFuMFBSTVctcU5SNEhDZThQZUFZSW1IWS0xbjJmYUdPQ1E0aFc1TXdUOEhodGRTUkxYdjBHTlJFc0tZcWFrcy1aWFNwakJqNUFDODVKaUg1QTJOUVhkM05KVzhOc2o5RGhzY2t0cVp0Wm5PNHBnU29FTkhMNzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Middle-aged and older adults who sought hospital or emergency room care because of cannabis use were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0530?guestAccessKey=73717de7-423a-4500-b10c-0f5117d1f69b&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;almost twice as likely to develop dementia&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years, compared with similar people in the general population, a large Canadian study reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When compared with adults who sought care for other reasons, the risk of developing dementia was still 23 percent higher among users of cannabis, the study also found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study included the medical records of six million people in Ontario from 2008 to 2021.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprinted with permission from &lt;a href="https://www.worldatlarge.news/2025/04/14/fish-oil-supplements-shown-to-be-more-effective-than-fish-for-getting-optimal-omega-3-intake/"&gt;World at Large.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fascinating new study, several dozen participants were separated into groups and fed either a fish oil supplement or fish itself, and the supplement proved more effective at delivering omega-3 fatty acids into the body than the actual fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was for years the norm, and likely still is in some quarters, for physicians to recommend trying to get all vital nutrients from foods, and not to rely on supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study at least has shown this to be wrong, as both white and oily fish weren’t able to replicate some of the more penetrative effects of omega-3 from a supplement. As a result, those who can’t afford to eat cod or salmon every day may need not worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of the study is that it was double-blinded and placebo controlled, meaning that neither the participants nor the scientists knew who got the fish oil and who ate fish, and in what combinations, a technique known as the “gold standard” in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the data after the study had been concluded revealed that a rather complex marker of disease risk called extracellular vesicles had only been improved by the presence of an additional intake of omega-3 from a supplement, and not by the consumption of white or oily fish alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are arguably the most important human nutrients for health and longevity. The P.hD. and science researcher Dr. Rhonda Patrick &lt;a href="https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/omega-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has a database of simple explanations&lt;/a&gt; on omega-3 that’s worth a read, and probably the most detailed informational resource on the internet for these valuable nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of their value in disease prevention and longevity is stunning. For example, one study Dr. Patrick cited shows that non-smokers with low omega-3 levels and daily smokers with high omega-3 levels&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522004737?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; have similar risk of death&lt;/a&gt; from cardiovascular disease, suggesting deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids is as great as risk of death as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extracellular vesicles, the culprit in many diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new paper &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/high-dose-fish-oil-supplements-are-more-effective-than-oily-fish-in-altering-the-number-and-function-of-extracellular-vesicles-in-healthy-human-subjects-a-randomized-doubleblind-placebocontrolled-parallel-trial/13CE2CDBF375E8DB55BD61D185CEAD1D?utm_source=klaviyo&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=%28Email%20-%20Chris%20Kresser%20General%20News%29%20Chris%27s%20Friday%20Favorites&amp;amp;utm_term=12-week%20clinical%20trial&amp;amp;utm_content=12-week%20clinical%20trial&amp;amp;_kx=lnJPNoBDbXDv8A7sGgOT2RynJbnjB0AOt2qh5yh0Zzn1efAmwTAJ2ZDqxahjsQ0T.my75y6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the British Journal of Nutrition, 42 participants were separated into three groups and had their diets controlled by 12 weeks. The first group was fed fish oil supplements plus white fish, the second was fed placebo plus oily fish, and the third placebo and white fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target of the paper was extracellular vesicles, (EVs) the source of an &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/csf/41/2/41_16014/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emerging body of literature&lt;/a&gt; on disease pathology. EVs are produced and excreted by all cells that have been examined for it. They can’t replicate, but these lipid-like particles do carry fragments of DNA and can enter other cells. For this reason they are implicated in a number of cancers, as well as&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4865996/"&gt; neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(19)30552-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, neurological problems, chronic inflammation, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVs also act as a procoagulant and senolytic, however, and have also been seen to extend the immunological memory of T cells, showing how they aren’t all bad. Their role may be similar to that of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and Interleukin-6, which are implicated in virtually every disease known to man, but also play a role in healing the body through acute inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVs are a compelling marker of disease to measure the impact of omega-3 levels, since they are created in comparatively low numbers in most organs and tissues and present a systematic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only the group that received the fish oil supplements which saw a reduction in the circulation of EVs in the bloodstream, while those who ate the kinds of fish recommended for improving omega-3 levels could not replicate this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of participants was small, both the randomized study design and the length of the study period of 3 months contribute to an overall strength of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Find yourself yawning a lot? Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such signs of sleepiness may be a red flag of a serious sleep deficit that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences," said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day," Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting a quality night's rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated," Olson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Kristen Knutson, sleep specialist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is," said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues," Knutson said via email. "If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A hidden danger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body does odd things when it's continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn't be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we're OK when we're really not," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes," she said. "And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We find people are actually making a lot of mistakes. And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, Penn Medicine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening," she said. "It can be very dangerous if you're driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it's an indication it's not safe to drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, according to statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tests of sleepiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/epworth-sleepiness-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt;, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions on the test include how likely you'll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations," she said. "The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you're very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you're having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation," she said. "You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don't care. That's another symptom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional causes of sleepiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as well as chronic pain conditions and medications can also contribute to sleepiness, which will be ruled out by a sleep specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can also ask your pharmacist about your prescriptions, and you should also consider any over-the-counter medications," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain lifestyle behaviors also can contribute to chronic sleepiness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things like too much caffeine, alcohol use before bed, using marijuana, the amount of exercise you're doing, and practicing poor sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a bright, cold, hot or noisy bedroom, will definitely affect how your sleep will be organized and how refreshing it's going to be," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to alcohol or marijuana in the mistaken belief that it can improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The vulva includes the external female genitalia, such as the labia majora and labia minora, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, can arise when certain bacteria enter the skin through a wound — a cut, abrasion, burn, surgical wound, or even an insect bite," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bill Sullivan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Indiana University, who was not involved in the case report, told Live Science in an email. "NF can occur anywhere skin or tissue is breached, including genitalia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In necrotizing fasciitis, bacteria infiltrate the fascia, which is the connective tissue surrounding muscles, nerves, fat and blood vessels. The infection rapidly causes soft tissues to die, or "necrotize," and spreads through the body very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-are-building-an-ultimate-atlas-of-the-vagina-heres-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-are-building-an-ultimate-atlas-of-the-vagina-heres-why"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists are building an ultimate atlas of the vagina.

"After these bacteria get into the skin, they release potent toxins that lead to rapid tissue destruction, liquefying muscle, nerves, and blood vessels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent loss of blood supply to the affected body parts makes treating necrotizing fasciitis with antibiotics difficult, Sullivan explained; infected areas sometimes need to be surgically cut out of the body. Additionally, once the bacteria get into the bloodstream, they can cause &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous, body-wide immune reaction, potentially leading to organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case report, the doctors described the cases of two patients who came to the emergency room with necrotising fasciitis of the vulva, as well as a third who developed the infection following a postoperative wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first patient was alerted to the infection when she found a small spot on her mons pubis — the fatty tissue over the pubic bone. She initially went to her primary care doctor, who prescribed antibiotics. However, the spot worsened over the next five days, which resulted in necrotizing fasciitis that spread to her labia majora, left hip and lower abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the ER, the infected tissue was surgically removed, or "debrided." But "despite intensive care unit (ICU) management for systemic infection," the patient died of sepsis only 28 hours after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient came to the ER with a one-week history of having a lump on her labia majora, which turned out to be an infected abscess. Over the next 12 hours, the upper third of her labia majora broke down from necrotizing fasciitis. The patient ultimately needed three debridements to control the infection, after which she underwent reconstructive surgery for the lost tissue. "The wound has since healed well," her doctors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third patient suffered necrotizing fasciitis after a surgical wound got infected; she had gotten a hysterectomy as a treatment for fibroids. This patient ultimately survived after having the infected tissue surgically removed and being given broad-spectrum antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NF is very rare," and it most often arises in people with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as diabetes or cancer, Sullivan explained. An estimated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.upmc.com/services/division-infectious-diseases/conditions/necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.upmc.com/services/division-infectious-diseases/conditions/necrotizing-fasciitis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;700 to 1,200 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are seen in the U.S. each year. About 500 cases are reported annually in the U.K., or about 0.4 to 0.53 cases per 100,000 people, the case report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaginal necrotizing fasciitis is even more rare, as people are more likely to have skin injuries on more exposed parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaginal NF could be contracted through rough sex, a piercing, or cosmetic and surgical procedures," Sullivan said. "The mortality rate of vaginal NF is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated to be up to 50%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report authors urged other gynecologists to keep an eye out for any signs of an infection that could develop into necrotizing fasciitis, and they also emphasized that "time is of the essence" when treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaginal NF could be considered more dangerous in the sense that it might be more difficult to diagnose in time, " Sullivan said. "Gynecologists may not have NF on their diagnostic radar, and surgical interventions, which are usually required to stop NF from spreading and remove dead tissue, may be limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the disease quickly is key to saving patients' lives. "Delayed diagnosis can lead to delayed treatment, increasing the odds of sepsis and death," Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-YBmfVwtuCnyw95HNR6D4uY-2AFO0bzfJztkhzFdoBaZxSWzHpV1WIJR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-YBmfVwtuCnyw95HNR6D4uY-2AFO0bzfJztkhzFdoBaZxSWzHpV1WIJR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After 36 months, the researchers realized something odd: that the children who had been given the popular stimulant seemed to be growing more slowly than their non-medicated counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers presumed, per their retelling to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, that this "height gap" would close in adolescence. When they followed up with them nine years after the study began, however, the medicated cohort was still 1.6 inches, on average, shorter than the kids who didn't take Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, the concern is very shallow. There's nothing wrong with being short, and if a drug can help with a myriad of other symptoms, maybe the risk is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not the only controversy around prescribing ADHD drugs to kids. The MTA study's biggest takeaway was, troublingly, that the attention benefits of Ritalin seemed to cease after the first year, and that there were no apparent benefits to academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even on top of that, the "height suppression" side effect was also enough to give the researchers pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the MTA study scientists &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6168061/pdf/nihms-838603.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;published a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; looking into the height gap that tracked the original cohort until they were 25. That height gap remained, per the study, into adulthood. And the findings countered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/09/01/344283889/more-evidence-that-adhd-drugs-dont-curb-ultimate-height" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bold academic assertions&lt;/a&gt; from just a few years prior claiming that any height suppression from ADHD meds in children would, as the researchers initially presumed, ultimately be undone in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, another group of scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420305923" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;reviewed 18 childhood Ritalin studies&lt;/a&gt; and found, similarly to the MTA researchers, that the drug can indeed "result in reduction in height and weight" — though their opinion was that the size of the effect is negligible when compared to the purported benefits of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, researchers can't agree as to whether or not stimulants can cause height suppression in children, primarily because the mechanism behind the demonstrated effect remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthcentral.com/article/do-stimulants-stunt-growth" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;website &lt;em&gt;Health Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, childhood psychiatrist and MTA study co-author Laurence Greenhill of the University of California, San Francisco suggested that amphetamines' well-known &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/medication-weight" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;propensity to suppress appetite&lt;/a&gt; could be behind the growth differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There could be some lack of nutrition going on that explains this," Greenhill told the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the kids aren't malnourished," he countered. "They're just growing a little more slowly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Ritalin or other stimulants help a child significantly, such a minor height disparity would be worthwhile. But with some of the original MTA study authors now questioning how effective these medical interventions really are, it may behoove parents to think before they put their kids on these pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on ADHD meds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/adhd-shortage-doctor-day" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Fill Your Adderall Prescription Amid Shortage, Try Getting It Filled on This Particular Day of the Month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:43:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFB3SDdqR1FWdDR1QUtZMmFEN215UFhGejNWa3hXT2xacUozeGFWVXRLbzFuSWhZY3NLV2tZWm16X3FWdUlULVZRanN3Z19VZ3pFLWFweDBjUk1HazFRSFZYWVV0YlFpV24xVHc</guid></item><item><title>这种被低估的营养素可能是大脑健康老化的关键- BBC科学焦点杂志 | This underrated nutrient could be key for healthy brain ageing - BBC Science Focus Magazine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE53Y3BMcXFhQ3Z4Rmx2T28xb2FUNG1qZ1ZFMWRTVFBCSWdZSlJKd3R1Nmg2SEl1RFd3YU8xMkVNYmlCTHNDZS1RVkh2SlBmakh5YjdOMjNBWUdlejdoQVctTTA3bG1rYXZ4WXNsZ1lEU2tUMFZEME51bjVMVENPQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div _ngcontent-purplestorefront-c2920483845 class="purple-inner-container purple-content-body-inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K – a nutrient we mainly get from green vegetables – might be crucial for protecting our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/human-brain"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022316625000306?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Tufts University, US, the vitamin may be particularly useful for maintaining cells in the hippocampus, the memory centre of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new experiment, scientists fed 60 middle-aged mice either a diet low in vitamin K, or a normal diet, for six months. Then, they performed behavioural tests designed to assess the mice’s learning and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/memory"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered that mice lacking vitamin K struggled with memory and learning. Compared to those on a normal diet, the vitamin K-deficient mice had trouble recognizing objects they’d seen before – an indication of impaired memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also took significantly longer to find their way through a water maze, pointing to difficulties with spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/04/Vitamin-K-1.png?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="An assortment of green vegetables laid out on a table." class="wp-image-201894"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Green vegetables are a rich source of vitamin K, such as spinach, kale, lettuce, brussels sprouts, broccoli and cabbage. Avocado and kiwi fruits are also rich in the nutrient - Credit: MEDITERRANEAN via Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the scientists analysed the mice’s brain tissue, particularly looking at the hippocampus: the brain region known for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus can generate new cells in a process called neurogenesis, which keeps the brain healthy and protects it from damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mice who were deficient in vitamin K showed signs of less neurogenesis in their brain tissue, as they had generated fewer new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neurogenesis is thought to play a critical role in learning and memory, and its impairment could directly contribute to the cognitive decline observed in the study,” said &lt;a href="https://hnrca.tufts.edu/people/faculty/tong-zheng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tong Zheng&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the study and a research scientist at Tufts’s Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA), in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also found signs of more inflammation in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice – another key reason for cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers warned against people just going out and buying vitamin K supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People need to eat a healthy diet,” said &lt;a href="https://hnrca.tufts.edu/people/faculty/sarah-l-booth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Sarah Booth&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the study and director of HNRCA, in a statement. “They need to eat their vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us get enough vitamin K in our diets, but low vitamin K intake is common among older adults. Great sources include spinach, kale, peas, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, parsley, avocado and kiwi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was recently published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The results of those tests can take months to establish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; has contacted the Hood River County Health Department for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob causes rapidly intensifying symptoms that present movement disorders and behavioral changes, similar to Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rare and deadly disorder is caused by infectious proteins called prions, which can cause small holes in the brain that resemble sponges under a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no treatment or cure. Deaths typically occur 12 months after infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 500 to 600 new cases occur in the U.S. each year. Most cases are believed to be hereditary, linked to a genetic mutation passed on from a parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease cannot be spread from person to person except through organ or tissue transplants or other exposure to infected brain or nervous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is linked to eating infected beef from cows with a related disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott said the three Hood River cases are not believed to be related to infected cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOVG9yYTVURmQ3WXBobEkzY0xxNUJ3NEtPc1dXUjQxQlJZSW4yNno4RFhsaEwzWU9MbENma0N2RllVdXN5OWNBWUJFaU9naDFiWTFZZ3puRElUaXppQVR4M1dvd2llQm5tX1lzaUc4MnVLa1BCNGVSOUFWSlVucVFBZWZfQW80UHctTGJ4S1dDbkRMVVFMZFVscFl3MFFVLU5mUUh1RVJPSQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，吃这种水果会降低认知功能-玻璃年鉴 | Study Reveals Declining Cognitive Function from Eating This Fruit - Glass Almanac</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOeHd1aENFQWNmSUpWRHlGMl8tNnVvZHN2MHZhQ1ZpNVNadzJWOWU1VnVTYnZySzRDZUU4R2xhdW5aUmI4S19OQms5WFRXWmk1Zlp5ZE9pUUN1OWNGeUhKMmZOcnpDRkdjbE9nMnVzSjF3UGgyV0wzOGlvcUhPM2hCcEl6bDF1REROcHIybGpCTVp3enZvMlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p class="" data-start="69" data-end="573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all know that eating a balanced diet is crucial for maintaining overall health, but new research highlights the surprising effect that certain foods can have on brain health and cognitive function. One of these foods, a tiny brain-shaped fruit, has garnered attention for its potential benefits in slowing down cognitive decline and even improving brain performance. However, another recent study suggests a different take—showing that certain fruit consumption might have an adverse effect over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="69" data-end="573"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5705"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="575" data-end="612"&gt;The Impact of Diet on Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="614" data-end="1327"&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in brain health, particularly in preventing cognitive decline, which can lead to conditions such as &lt;strong data-start="740" data-end="763"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;—a disease affecting an estimated 80,000 to a million people in countries like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-largest-hydrogen-deposit-ever-found-in-france-is-rewriting-the-energy-game/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, specific diets like the &lt;strong data-start="883" data-end="905"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong data-start="914" data-end="927"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/strong&gt; have been associated with slowing cognitive decline and reducing the risk of dementia. But one food that has come to the forefront in recent studies is the &lt;strong data-start="1084" data-end="1091"&gt;nut&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly &lt;strong data-start="1106" data-end="1117"&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;. While nuts like almonds, cashews, and pistachios have long been praised for their health benefits, a study from &lt;strong data-start="1231" data-end="1252"&gt;Dutch researchers&lt;/strong&gt; has provided fresh insights into how they might impact cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1329" data-end="1381"&gt;A Study on Nut Consumption and Cognitive Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1383" data-end="1971"&gt;Published in &lt;strong data-start="1396" data-end="1418"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; on June 2, the study focused on the long-term effects of nut consumption, specifically on brain health. The researchers aimed to explore how eating nuts could impact the &lt;strong data-start="1589" data-end="1610"&gt;vascular function&lt;/strong&gt; in elderly individuals, particularly the functioning of the small blood vessels that feed the brain. The study involved a group of 28 healthy individuals, averaging 65 years old. The participants were split into two groups: one that consumed 60 grams of mixed nuts daily (including walnuts, pistachios, cashews, and hazelnuts) and a control group that did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1973" data-end="2599"&gt;At the end of the 16-week period, the results were compelling. The group that consumed nuts was able to recall &lt;strong data-start="2084" data-end="2102"&gt;16% more words&lt;/strong&gt; during a verbal memory test compared to those who didn’t eat nuts. In addition to improvements in memory, the study found that nuts helped &lt;strong data-start="2242" data-end="2301"&gt;maintain the flexibility and elasticity of the arteries&lt;/strong&gt;, which is beneficial for &lt;strong data-start="2327" data-end="2352"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;. The participants who consumed nuts also showed better circulation in the small blood vessels in the eyes, which correlated with increased blood flow in different areas of the brain, suggesting that the effects went beyond just cognitive recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2601" data-end="2657"&gt;The Role of Antioxidants in Slowing Cognitive Decline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2659" data-end="3059"&gt;The findings on cognitive improvement are tied to the role of &lt;strong data-start="2721" data-end="2737"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;, which are vital in combating &lt;strong data-start="2768" data-end="2788"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Our brains are particularly susceptible to this form of stress, which can damage brain cells over time and lead to memory decline. While cognitive decline is part of the natural aging process, consuming foods rich in antioxidants, like nuts, can help slow this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="3061" data-end="3405"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3061" data-end="3076"&gt;Dani Felber&lt;/strong&gt;, a dietitian specializing in brain health, explains that oxidative stress damages brain cells, accelerating cognitive decline. “The more antioxidants you consume, the slower the cognitive decline,” she says. &lt;strong data-start="3285" data-end="3293"&gt;Nuts&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly &lt;strong data-start="3308" data-end="3319"&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;, are rich in antioxidants, making them an excellent addition to a brain-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3407" data-end="3734"&gt;However, while the study showed improvement in memory recall, it didn’t find significant changes in areas like decision-making, stress levels, or overall quality of life. This suggests that while nuts can play a role in improving certain aspects of brain function, their impact on other cognitive domains might be more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3736" data-end="3778"&gt;Future Directions: More Research Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3780" data-end="4236"&gt;While the study provided valuable insights, it also highlighted the need for more extensive research. A larger sample size could help clarify how consuming nuts regularly affects other areas of cognitive health. In fact, previous studies, like one published in the &lt;strong data-start="4045" data-end="4079"&gt;Journal of &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/alzheimers-researchers-pinpoint-a-new-factor-behind-the-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;‘s Disease&lt;/strong&gt; in 2014, found that eating a handful of nuts a day could reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and even slow its progression in those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4238" data-end="4428"&gt;As the research in this field grows, it becomes clear that small dietary changes, like adding more nuts to your daily intake, can make a big difference in maintaining brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes referred to as the “Oscars of Science,” &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/"&gt;Breakthrough Prizes&lt;/a&gt; are given each year to scientists who drive innovative discoveries in the life sciences, physics, and mathematics. This year, six prizes of $3 million each were awarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two MS researchers — Stephen Hauser, MD, and Alberto Ascherio, MD, doctor of public health — will share one of the three life sciences awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year’s Breakthrough Prize laureates have made amazing strides — including treatments for major diseases affecting millions of people worldwide — showing once again the transformative power of curiosity-driven basic science,” Priscilla Chan, MD, and Mark Zuckerberg, two of the prize’s founding sponsors, said in a Breakthrough Prize Foundation &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/91"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MS is an autoimmune condition wherein the immune system mistakenly attacks &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve cells. These inflammatory attacks produce areas of damage called &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser, a professor of neurology and director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco, earned the award for identifying that immune B-cells are key drivers of these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, it was believed that MS was driven mainly by a class of immune cells called T-cells, but Hauser’s work in animal models and MS patient tissue showed that B-cells also played a central role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discovery led to the development of B-cell-targeted therapies now widely used to treat MS. This class of therapies includes Genentech’s &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab), Novartis’ &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ofatumumab-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Kesimpta&lt;/a&gt; (ofatumumab), and TG Therapeutics’ &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/experimental-treatments-for-ms/ublituximab-tgtx-1101/"&gt;Briumvi&lt;/a&gt; (ublituximab), all of which are antibody-based therapies designed to deplete B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; have substantially altered the outlook for MS patients, according to the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, newly diagnosed patients would be told that they may require a cane or wheelchair within 15 years,” Hauser said in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/04/429746/stephen-hauser-wins-breakthrough-prize-role-redefining-ms"&gt;university news article&lt;/a&gt;. “Today, our data indicate that many new patients can expect lives free from disability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist acknowledged that many others contributed to the discoveries that led to B-cell-depleting therapies for MS, particularly the patients who participated in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without them, this breakthrough would not have been possible,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser now continues with research to help improve outcomes for people with MS, including work to discover genes linked to the disease. He hopes that a recently discovered genetic region could lead to new therapeutic approaches for people with progressive forms of MS who don’t respond as well to B-cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have never been more optimistic for the future: what’s in store for our patients today, as well as those developing MS in the future, who may soon be diagnosed — and treated — even before they experience their first &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt;,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discoveries about the Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, was involved in the historic discovery that a past infection with the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) is a leading &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;cause of MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascherio’s career has been inspired by a drive to identify the root cause of diseases to prevent them from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You realize that if you don’t prevent diseases and you don’t address the causes of disease, then people will keep getting sick,” Ascherio said in a &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/alberto-ascherio-receives-breakthrough-prize-for-groundbreaking-research-on-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Harvard news article&lt;/a&gt;. “So, I thought, can we go more to the root — to find the cause of the disease and intervene there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most adults have been infected with EBV, even if they aren’t aware of it. After the initial infection, the virus is latent within the body for the rest of a person’s life. Scientists had believed for many decades that MS could be caused by a viral infection such as EBV, but there hadn’t been sufficient data to establish that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study involving more than 10 million members of the U.S. military, Ascherio and colleagues found that EBV infection &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/01/13/epstein-barr-virus-may-be-leading-cause-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;raised the risk of developing MS later in life by 32 times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s virtually a consensus now that EBV is the leading cause of MS,” Ascherio said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has led to the work on developing therapies that target EBV as a way to treat MS. Efforts are also underway to develop vaccines for preventing EBV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ascherio and colleagues are continuing to investigate the mechanistic link between the common virus and MS as a way to better understand which infected people will ultimately develop the neurodegenerative disease. They’re also trying to understand whether viral infections play a role in other neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:12:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQNHRJZlZISXcwQ1NiZ3NrZk40UGVtQ1F5eFJSLXlJYUNvZy00STg5bEZzb19SRTdCNllqTUtGQ0F2RThHVjZQWUtwQXg4ZXNjVlA3eFVsbkc4YVQ5NUhJNFYtREg5Zl9Nb3VrbVJVUFpJYkxuWUpqSHZnSGNHNmpKcDY4WVdidmYwYmlaZnBDRXM1X3h4X185TXZjalZ6MnJ4OVdHYUNOWW5vYS0wXzl3Snk0UmJ5c1o4V3ItS3M5N09NWWd6</guid></item><item><title>常见食用油中的脂肪与侵袭性乳腺癌有关-但这就是你不应该恐慌的原因-对话 | Fat in common cooking oils is linked to aggressive breast cancer - but here’s why you shouldn’t panic - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxNaHFVNGhobTdFVW5RUE51ZVZpNzkzUmNoT3RvczZMSm9Uelcta3Eyc21nY29hVWtITFQwMFExY1lTVXdET3FxQWprN21Rbkd5VXJ5Q2hLYS0xOWFzaUF2bEd3ZXMyYTBSN2NaVnVVOHpfdGxnYWljSDdkakdPMElESEEybzA0V1FaN1ZCcU5xOWhGcWgyVGNjSEliTTU3bUhaajFkdE9VQkgyQTBpWkx6Zk9wTEZnR1BXeFB0S21Vem54aTVJQll3Z1A3NVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body " itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s now lots of evidence which &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt; and the foods we eat can influence the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; if we are unlucky enough to suffer from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are especially interested in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;how this happens&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these associations. This would better inform &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;nutritional recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and help us understand how cancer forms so we can prevent it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; has identified a molecular link between linoleic acid, a common fat contained in cooking oils, and aggressive breast cancer, renewing the discussion about dietary choices and cancer risk. The findings, while significant, require careful interpretation to avoid unnecessary alarm and give useful guidance to the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Common fatty acid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"&gt;Linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt; is an omega-6 fatty acid which is found in abundant quantities in soybean, sunflower and corn oils. Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York showed it can directly activate a growth pathway in triple-negative breast cancer cells – a type of breast cancer especially known for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125284/"&gt;aggressiveness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927455/"&gt;limited treatment options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triple negative breast cancer makes up about 15% of all breast cancer cases, but because breast cancer is so common, this affects a lot of people. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FABP5"&gt;FABP5&lt;/a&gt; (fatty acid-binding protein 5), which is at high levels in these cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This binding triggers the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0199-y"&gt;mTORC1 pathway&lt;/a&gt; – a critical regulator of cell growth and metabolism – fuelling tumour progression in preclinical research, including animal studies. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596643/"&gt;My current research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on this pathway in a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1387/v2"&gt;normal and cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, mice fed a high linoleic-acid diet developed larger tumours, suggesting dietary intake may exacerbate this cancer’s growth. There was a link to people too: elevated FABP5 and linoleic acid levels were detected in blood samples from triple-negative breast cancer patients, strengthening the biological plausibility of this link. Dr John Blenis, the senior author of the paper, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalised manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that the implications extend beyond triple negative breast cancer to other tumours such as prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid is an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513547/"&gt;essential fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; so it must be obtained from food. It plays a role in skin health, cell membrane structure and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31785494/"&gt;inflammation regulation&lt;/a&gt;. However, modern diets, which are rich in processed foods, ultraprocesed foods and seed oils, often provide excessive omega-6 fats, including linoleic acid, while lacking omega-3s, which are found in fish, flaxseeds and walnuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This imbalance could promote &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00658-5"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a well known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6831096/"&gt;contributor to cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study therefore suggests that linoleic acid may directly drive cancer growth in specific contexts. This challenges earlier observational studies that found no clear association between dietary linoleic acid and overall breast cancer risk. For example, a 2023 meta-analysis of 14 studies in over 350,000 women concluded that linoleic acid intake had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10271020/"&gt;no significant effect&lt;/a&gt; on breast cancer risk in the general population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy highlights the importance of researchers looking specifically at cancer subtypes and also individual factors, such as FABP5 levels in cancers themselves. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558966/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; showed that linoleic acid was protective against breast cancer, which demonstrates why it’s important to consider everything in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don’t panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media headlines can often oversimplify complex research. While this new study highlights a plausible mechanism linking linoleic acid to cancer growth, it does not prove that cooking oils cause breast cancer – far from it. Other factors, such as genetics, overall diet and environmental exposures, play significant roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals. Many oils such as olive oil contain less linoleic acid and higher monounsaturated or saturated fats, which are more stable at high heat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do also consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00879-6"&gt;eating more fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; as part of a healthy, balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that  comprehensively analysed eating habits over 30 years showed that diets that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and low-fat dairy products were linked to healthy ageing. In that study, the Harvard team followed more than 100,000 people between 1986 and 2016. Fewer than 10% of respondents achieved healthy ageing, defined by a lack of 11 major chronic diseases and no impairment in cognitive, physical or mental function by the age of 70. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations like the World Cancer Research Fund emphasise that moderate use of vegetable oils is safe and that &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/action-on-obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, not specific fats, is the primary dietary driver of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study, then, underscores the importance of contextualising dietary fats in cancer research. While linoleic acid’s role in triple-negative breast cancer is a critical discovery, it’s one piece of a vast puzzle.

&lt;p&gt;Mimicking the activity of the molecule, miR-216a-3p, eased inflammation and scarring in a rat model of the disease. Its therapeutic effects seem to lie in its ability to inhibit the pro-inflammatory STAT1/JAK signaling pathway, preventing the activation of the immune B-cells that have been implicated in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results collectively suggest a potentially significant role for miR-216a-3p in the [development] of autoimmune diseases, warranting further investigation,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X25003614?viaihub"&gt;&lt;span&gt;miR-216a-3p alleviates primary Sjögren’s syndrome by regulating the STAT1/JAK signaling pathway&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s disease is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s healthy moisture-producing glands, leading to &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as dry eyes and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MicroRNAs seen driving diseases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some cases of Sjögren’s are associated with other underlying conditions — this is known as secondary Sjögren’s — the &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;cause of primary Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, in which the condition arises in the absence of other diseases, is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating data suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs), small strands of genetic material capable of influencing gene activity, play a role in driving autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2756047"&gt;altered miRNA profiles&lt;/a&gt; have been observed in the tears of people with primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several miRNAs are known to influence genes involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This pathway has been linked to inflammation and activation of antibody-producing immune cells, namely B-cells, that are believed to contribute to Sjögren’s disease processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to further identify the miRNAs that might be involved in Sjögren’s, and to establish their influence on JAK/STAT signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first looked at gene activity data sets from people with and without Sjögren’s, finding gene activity changes particularly associated with inflammatory responses. The most substantially altered one was the JAK/STAT gene &lt;em&gt;STAT1,&lt;/em&gt; which had elevated activity in Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists then identified a number of miRNAs that might work upstream of &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; to regulate its activity, with miR-216a-3p being the one predicted to have the greatest effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miR-216a-3p activity was lower in glandular tissues of people with primary Sjögren’s relative to people without it, while &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity was higher. Blood and salivary gland tissue analyses showed signs of elevated inflammation in people with primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further explore the role of miR-216a-3p, the scientists treated a rat model of Sjögren’s with compounds to either mimic or inhibit miR-216a-3p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment with the miR-216a-3p mimic led to significant reductions in inflammation and scarring within the salivary glands and helped to increase saliva flow rate. Inflammation and scarring were increased, while salivary flow rate was decreased, with the miR-216a-3p inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in humans, miR-216a-3p activity was reduced and &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity was increased in salivary gland tissue from the rat model. When the rats were treated with the miR-216a-3p mimic, &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity went down, as did the levels of several pro-inflammatory proteins in the blood. Again, the reverse was true with the miR-216a-3p inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that the miR-216a-3p mimic appeared to inhibit the activation of JAK/STAT signaling to prevent the overactivation of B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding not only reveals the potential role of miR-216a-3p in regulating B cell function but also provides a new therapeutic target for [primary Sjögren’s],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists said future research will focus more on how miR-216a-3p influences B-cell signaling pathways, and will further evaluate its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will not only help deepen our understanding of the [development of primary Sjögren’s] but may also offer new therapeutic insights for other autoimmune diseases,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Sjogren's Syndrome News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:47:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNeVBNUy1qbWloOVdOYi1iOVNmNWxZVnZHZkJHWjIwd3VRM0VWY2l4eUl3dkRHZG1OZ0l1VTNMSmlWcG9ycDZRZVBNdlNvWEVld1dNOERwUUNRc0o3ZmEyMUFVcjVBUXJiRnl5WlFhbmRmNDVnNXk2cU9IVUJTQUl1RTE2X1BocE5y</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，他们可能发现了自闭症的一个令人震惊的原因--《每日邮报》 | Scientists say they may have discovered a shocking cause of autism - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQdEt5NFloNHlIWjRsVDdGZF9USlVhX1I2RzhxQmpZOGMyMGtybGUtTXlGMEhDSWZRcnNwb0NMM2hndVQyakNKQTRGUmZhVGdYWXZ5N2VUY2t5aTlaaVhiQ1VKdjlybm1GNjJ2MFYzZnJrVWhQNzAteVVKMVR4T0swWG1UaVhHbjVXcjBmZE03c1gyc0lZVDh0dnNFX19veU1HX3ZIbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism might begin in the gut — not the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study has found autistic children have [distinctly] different bacteria in their stomachs compared to kids without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say these changes to the microbiome - a network of bacteria that regulate digestion and other processes - lead to changes in parts of the brain associated with behavior and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet and other environmental exposures in the womb have been linked to harmful microbiome changes in babies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted autistic children were also more likely to have had mothers who used antibiotics in pregnancy, suggesting use of the medications could have increased the risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared stool samples and brain scans of children aged eight to 17 with autism compared to typically developing children in the same age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found autistic children and teens had lower levels of certain metabolites - small molecules produced during digestion - than neurotypical children, causing their guts to produce less of the mood-regulating hormone serotonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe these &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13567627/gut-bacteria-stress-mental-health.html"&gt;changes in the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; may lead to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14167135/Psychologist-reveals-common-traits-autistic.html"&gt;symptoms of autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like communication difficulties and behavioral issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This so-called 'gut-brain' connection theory has been suggested for decades as a potential autism cause but was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7025313/Can-boosting-good-gut-bacteria-really-help-autism.html"&gt;thought to have been debunked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Changes to the gut microbiome may help explain a rise in autism cases, acccording to a new study (stock images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the new study injects life back into that theory by looking at stool samples and brain scans at the same time and homing in one particular sets of metabolites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of Southern California, said the findings could lead to treatments targeting the gut 'while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for [autistic children],' like bloating and constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned more large-scale, definitive research is still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, lead study author and professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-5fe889e0-193d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1#Sec9"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, compared 43 children with autism to 41 neurotypical children from healthcare clinics in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-170e4800-192d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were between eight and 17 years old, and the average age was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of the autistic participants took medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics and stimulants for their behaviors. None of the neurotypical children took prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers asked all of the children to stay away from antibiotics for a month and probiotics for two weeks, as both medications can alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study took place over the course of two days. On the first day, researchers gave the children behavioral assessments. On the second day, participants brought in stool samples and underwent MRI scans of their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents were also asked to report which diet their children most closely followed: Standard American (high consumption of processed foods, red meat, poultry, eggs and dairy), Modified American (high consumption of whole grains, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruits and some processed foods), Mediterranean, Paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP or other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers honed in on metabolites in participants' stool that followed the 'tryptophan pathway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typtophan is an amino acid found in turkey, salmon, eggs, and seeds that breaks down into the metabolite serotonin, which is crucial for brain functions like emotional processing, social interaction and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted because more than 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, changes in gut health could influence serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerve cells in the gut then send signals to the brain, a phenomenon known as the gut-brain axis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children in the study with autism were more likely to have mothers who used antibiotics during pregnancy, which could have caused gut microbiome disturbances (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and social isolation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 15 percent, or 49.5 million Americans, and about 2.3 million people in the UK regularly use cannabis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, recreational use is legal in 24 states while 38 states allow its use for medicinal purposes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequently visiting the emergency room at your local hospital due to smoking weed may increase your risk for developing dementia by 72 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the latest study, the researchers studied over six million people aged 45 to 105 years old from Ontario, Canada, who had no history of dementia between January 2008 and December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, they identified 16,275 people who had developed dementia and had a history of cannabis use that required acute care - defined as a visit to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These people were then compared to people in three groups: individuals with an all-cause acute care visit; the general population and individuals with acute care due to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that five percent of people aged 45 years or older who had received treatment for cannabis in acute care were diagnosed with dementia within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, only 1.3 percent of the general population (non smokers who do not require acute care) and 3.6 percent of individuals receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a five year span. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 19 percent of people in the same group who had received cannabis-related care had developed dementia within 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merely 5.5 percent of the general population and 14.8 people receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a decade's time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that the risk of dementia in individuals with acute care for cannabis was 31 percent lower over the next five years than individuals who required acute care for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Daniel Myran, an author of the study and Associate Scientist at The Ottawa Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular cannabis use can affect the brain, particularly areas responsible for memory, learning, attention, decision-making, coordination, emotion and reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain research suggests that long-term cannabis use may cause shrinkage of the hippocampus, responsible for forming new memories and learning, and reduce overall blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shrinking (atrophy) of the hippocampus can often cause cognitive problems like memory issues, difficulty with attention, and impaired executive function  - leading to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term cannabis use can also impact cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THC, a psychoactive compound found in cannabis, can make the heart beat faster and can raise blood pressure immediately after use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frequent weed intake can impact the blood pressure levels in the body and increase risk of stroke, heart disease and other vascular diseases in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can affect the overall blood flow in the body and interfere in the proper functioning of the organs, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drug has seen a meteoric rise over the past decade, culminating in legal recreational use in 24 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term or frequent cannabis use has also been linked to increased risk of psychosis or schizophrenia in some users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors noted that more research is needed to establish a clear link between cannabis use and cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Myran, an author of the study and Associate Scientist at The Ottawa Hospital said: 'While we collectively need more research to better understand potential risks of regular cannabis use on cognition and dementia, we hope these findings can inform discussion between patients and healthcare providers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, private cannabis prescriptions doubled - reaching nearly 180,000 - according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in JAMA Neurology today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZEkyckhRWlRJcl9JMXdQNDhodUJsOTVFaGhJVzRDbWdlUF85ZWtrUUFTMjliX2JTcFg2RkhaZTMwV19TbE5oZUdxVFdwZlotRFBPeldRR3dSbjNVV1I2NXl0dTJIQmx1QklTRkw0cy1YZEVtMjk4SkRIc21ybTEwZWdyN2VWeGlrS2hqcXFrVVVKdHBXcERCLXRtN1FXVXM1WW50OVJlUk94VWdGcVBpTU5HMNIBuAFBVV95cUxPWEtIUlhoU3FVdXl5UWxfazJ5R2NTTEJzZjNZNkNNZzFRUUdlQlE5dk1IRUpYeUF5T2NaUnVtWXZ5d3ZnWk5QMEhHMmdCZV90dDlwRXJFM0x0WFp1Mkp0MzJkVGgzX1E5Ty1fYU1pczJkU016a1YwVkMyZ09OdmhJVzlMNHd5MUx2ZXRLa0FiT1pzeHh0STJtXzNJeGRCZnJfTFlIaEZyTEtxR3ZKS1FBS1E1bklXMm9H</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，两种廉价药物的组合可以挽救心脏病发作后的生命-《卫报》 | Combination of two cheap drugs could save lives after heart attack, study finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDJEWmRJSXk0Ymo2SThQeVZlMlpDZ1pQYjlOU29IbUJNNDlmWVN4ekpPMzd0WHJuZDRfMGtKYVhXQzNJTzh5bDhDcVBmOTNVZ3NYVGNidS16dVMxV0pob0lJZGx6MUx2UlJibUF2TjFsWldiX01NQ0ZrRE9tU2NLb21iYVlIQkswdW1MdGpJYnpsTjBfMDNSSV84ejlMNjdZMS1tay1hemdrc3BlRmZkTmJDeTMwN3p2Y3BINTJJVC1CSWUzdXk1dVQ1Y2JzVGFZWW93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Thousands of heart attacks or strokes could be prevented and lives saved with a combination of two cheap drugs, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, with heart attacks the most common acute event.

and Lund University in Sweden found that by giving heart attack patients two drugs together – statins and ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug – their risk of another heart attack, stroke or death was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs,” said Prof Kausik Ray, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That is causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths – and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our study shows the way forward. Care pathways must now change for patients after this type of heart event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers analysed patient data to measure the potential impact of the dual combination of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They compared patients who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack, those who were given statins with ezetimibe added between 13 weeks and 16 months, and others who got just statins with no ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Data from 36,000 Swedish patients who had a heart attack between 2015 and 2022 was analysed, and advanced statistical models were used to emulate a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack and were able to lower cholesterol to the target level early had a better prognosis and less risk of new cardiovascular events and death than those who received the add-on treatment later, or not at all, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings suggest that a simple change in treatment guidelines could have a huge impact on patients,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Ezetimibe is already widely available and prescribed for relatively low cost. This add-on therapy could be rolled out for around £350 a year per patient, which is a huge cost saving compared to the lasting impacts of treating heart attacks and the impact they have on patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Margret Leosdottir, an associate professor at Lund University and a senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden, said she hoped the findings would lead to changes in global guidelines, in order to “prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leosdottir said the combination therapy was currently not typically offered to heart attack patients globally because a “precautionary principle” was applied to avoid side-effects and overmedication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, there are positive effects from applying both medicines as soon after the infarction [heart attack] as possible. Not doing this entails an increased risk. In addition, the drug we have examined in the study causes few side-effects and is readily available and inexpensive in many countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDJEWmRJSXk0Ymo2SThQeVZlMlpDZ1pQYjlOU29IbUJNNDlmWVN4ekpPMzd0WHJuZDRfMGtKYVhXQzNJTzh5bDhDcVBmOTNVZ3NYVGNidS16dVMxV0pob0lJZGx6MUx2UlJibUF2TjFsWldiX01NQ0ZrRE9tU2NLb21iYVlIQkswdW1MdGpJYnpsTjBfMDNSSV84ejlMNjdZMS1tay1hemdrc3BlRmZkTmJDeTMwN3p2Y3BINTJJVC1CSWUzdXk1dVQ1Y2JzVGFZWW93</guid></item></channel></rss>
