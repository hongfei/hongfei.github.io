&lt;p&gt;"When you're asleep and have obstructed breathing, your body panics a little bit, releasing a bit of adrenaline into your bloodstream to wake you up enough to breathe. With Apnea, this can happen hundreds of times a night. Adrenaline is not good for you 300 times a night. It's great if you get surprised by a wild animal and need to run away or climb a tree, but otherwise, no good for you at all. It debilitates almost every major organ and metabolic system in your body. Long-term repeated exposure can really mess you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you even THINK you might have a problem, get it checked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1l51rha/comment/mwe4b3y/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt;u/JetScreamerBaby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Research reveals that their brains either resist Alzheimer’s-related plaques and tangles or remain resilient despite having them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals maintain a youthful brain structure, with a thicker cortex and unique neurons linked to memory and social skills. Insights from their biology and behavior could inspire new strategies to protect cognitive health into late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score like 50–60-year-olds on memory tests despite being 80+.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; They have thicker cortex regions and unique neurons linked to social and memory functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Resistance or resilience to Alzheimer’s pathology helps preserve function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 25 years, scientists at Northwestern Medicine have been studying individuals aged 80 and older — dubbed “SuperAgers” — to better understand what makes them tick. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unique individuals, who show outstanding memory performance at a level consistent with individuals who are at least three decades younger, challenge the long-held belief that cognitive decline is an inevitable part of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112100"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the quarter-century of research, the scientists have seen some notable lifestyle and personality differences between SuperAgers and those aging typically — such as being social and gregarious — but “it’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Dr. Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying biological and behavioral traits associated with SuperAging, the scientists hope to uncover new strategies to promote cognitive resilience and delay or prevent Alzheimer’s and other diseases that cause cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile. This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life,” said Weintraub, corresponding author of a new paper summarizing the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper will be published in a perspective piece in Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association as part of the journal’s special issue commemorating the 40th anniversary of the National Institute on Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease Centers Program and the 25th anniversary of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SuperAger brains are resilient, resistant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “SuperAger” was coined by Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, who founded the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, a cohort of 290 SuperAger participants has passed through the Mesulam Center’s doors, and the scientists have autopsied 77 donated SuperAger brains. Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins (also known as plaques and tangles), which are known to play key roles in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but others didn’t develop any. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional memory performance:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youthful brain structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike typically aging brains, SuperAgers show no significant thinning of their cortex — the outer layer of the brain — and even have a thicker anterior cingulate cortex than younger adults. This crucial region of the brain plays a significant role in integrating information related to decision-making, emotion and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique cellular traits:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers have more von economo neurons, which are specialized cells linked to social behavior, and larger entorhinal neurons, which are critical for memory, than their typically aging peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability as a common trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite having diverse lifestyles and varying approaches to exercise, SuperAgers tend to be highly social and report strong interpersonal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain donation can offer scientific immortality’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Mesulam Center, SuperAgers are evaluated annually and may choose to donate their brains for post-mortem evaluation by Northwestern scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said co-author Dr. Tamar Gefen, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg, director of Feinberg’s Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychology and a neuropsychologist at the Mesulam Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Learn more about how to join the SuperAger research registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective piece is titled, “The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program.” Other Northwestern authors include Dr. Mesulam and Changiz Geula, research professor of cell and developmental biology and neuroscience at Feinberg and a member of the Mesulam Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78130b19150d1d140b17163816170a0c100f1d0b0c1d0a16561d1c0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Weintraub et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp;

they also have a region in the cingulate gyrus that is thicker than younger neurotypical adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to cellular biology, superagers have fewer Alzheimer’s disease–type changes in the brain, greater size of entorhinal neurons, fewer inflammatory microglia in white matter, better preserved cholinergic innervation, and a greater density of evolutionarily progressive von Economo neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, deeper characterization of the superaging phenotype may lead to interventions that enhance resistance and resilience to involutional changes considered part of average (i.e., “normal”) brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired investigations throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Local health officials are still investigating how a Pierce County woman who hadn’t traveled recently &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/malaria-possibly-contracted-in-wa-would-be-states-first-case/" class="content-link"&gt;might have contracted malaria&lt;/a&gt; — but however it happened, the situation involved an “unusual sequence of events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is rare for a few reasons, said Dr. James Miller, health officer of the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, which &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;announced the news &lt;/a&gt;Wednesday. It’s Washington state’s first locally acquired case, meaning the woman was most likely bitten here by a malaria-infected mosquito, which would have gotten malaria after biting someone else with the disease, who had traveled recently and perhaps contracted malaria abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were the case, it would be a “very unusual sequence of events” Miller said, “which is why we’re doing this more extensive investigation for this case than we would typically for a travel-acquired malaria case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne disease does not spread from person to person, nor does it spread between mosquitoes, so risk to the general public is low, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient is receiving treatment, Miller said, but declined to give more details about her condition. He noted it’s common for people with malaria to be hospitalized, as the disease can cause very serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of the malaria-infected mosquito biting another person in the county is “pretty low,” Miller reiterated. “But of course, malaria is a serious disease. That’s why we’re taking this seriously and doing a full investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation includes, in the meantime, a plan to work with the state Department of Health to set up mosquito traps all over the county and collect data from them. It’s unlikely they’ll find the malaria-infected mosquito that bit the Pierce County patient, Miller acknowledged, but the data is useful in gauging how many other mosquitoes might be carrying the malaria parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main purpose is really just to get a sense of … the burden for the population of Anopheles mosquitoes, which is the set of species that can transmit malaria,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the investigation also looks at other patients in Washington recently diagnosed with malaria, to see if there could be any potential connections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, malaria cases are usually linked to travel, mainly from sub-Saharan African countries, and regions of South America and Southeast Asia, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Anopheles mosquitoes, which are in Pierce County and Washington, can transmit malaria across the U.S. if they bite someone infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sees about 2,000 to 2,500 cases per year, and &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/notifiable-conditions/malaria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Washington sees 20 to 70 reports of malaria&lt;/a&gt; in travelers each year, according to the state Department of Health. In 2023, the U.S. saw its first locally acquired malaria case in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten cases were reported across four states — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Florida, Texas, Maryland and Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; — from May to October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 19 cases of travel-associated malaria have been reported in Washington state, according to DOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Miller said, mosquito populations are starting to shrink in Pierce County and throughout the state at this point in the year. Mosquitoes like warm weather and being near water to breed, so they prefer early summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When temperatures fall, populations also decline, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people should try to take basic precautions to avoid getting bit, he said, including: wearing bug spray, removing standing water in yards and considering long pants or long sleeves if in a place there are mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if traveling to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prevention-information-by-country.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;country where there’s risk of malaria&lt;/a&gt;, think about precautionary measures such as taking medication before, during and after your trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease typically causes fever, chills, body aches, headaches and fatigue. Without treatment, it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/surveillance-report/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people recognize these symptoms or suspect malaria, health officials recommend seeking early testing and treatment. The disease can be treated with antimalarial drugs. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For context, an AQI of 100 or more is unhealthy for sensitive groups, and an AQI of 150 is unhealthy for everyone. I mentioned the unhealthy air to a friend who reminded me that New York City recently installed a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/"}' href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;concrete recycling center&lt;/a&gt; a few blocks from my home.

At that point the recycling center had yet to implement irrigation to mitigate the dust plumes. The data from my outdoor monitor fed into PurpleAir’s crowdsourced real-time &lt;a data-offer-url="https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173"}' href="https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;.

EPA&lt;/a&gt; is reconsidering the Biden administration's PM 2.5 standards. To quote EPA administrator Zeldin, “All Americans deserve to breathe clean air while pursuing the American dream. Under President Trump, we will ensure air quality standards for particulate matter are protective of human health and the environment while we unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Trump administration also wants to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001"}' href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;repeal greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; regulations. According to a statement from the EPA, “The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128229286000095"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; states otherwise. And so, as outdoor air becomes less regulated, it has the potential to get dirtier and make &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.1509676"&gt;people sick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Too Close to Home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This past spring, the smell of campfire filled my home. I peered out my fourth-floor window to see my neighbor’s illegal fire pit three backyards over. I watched the colors on my PurpleAir Zen outdoor monitor change from green to yellow to crimson over the course of an hour. When I logged onto the crowd-sourced PurpleAir real-time map, I could see that my outdoor air quality was an unhealthy 160 PM 2.5 and that a few blocks away, air quality was good at under 30 PM 2.5. There’s nothing surprising about a fire pit generating air pollution, but I didn’t realize how intense and localized that air pollution could be, even though I was four stories up in a half-a-city-block-sized area. This is air quality on a microscale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Lisa Wood Shapiro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 12:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBTM1BobURDOFE4c2VyN2JCV1BMZDBXYnB5YTdkN3JLNUFUYTc4ZW9uREZkTVd5M1E2aXN6UGFnWW8tREM0SzhRMHJYSkFYV1FWYUxBc191SVJ1bEhXSEhGX3VJSmZ4emdpTGRDd0xGWHZFclhhVnp0bFpob3U</guid></item><item><title>一名青少年足球运动员在脑震荡后出现了数月的症状。医生发现了一种罕见的脑部畸形。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNRHFjWXNlWHhBRkZGUFVneWMxVWp1b3k3UWIwYUdjT1BjQS1xc1RsZHJOUEhwXzdZQm9ET0tYaGtzdXNtajBKR1ZmaUdXa2MySTg1WFBQckF4MV9VY3RwR19TMXF2S3d0ckROWXUzTURVdTdtZWZMQnc1Z3pkbEFuOHBaNWhGeDFvVlpzcVhYY1lSUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPaTZ4ZWU3MlNjZVRqbW1YZUMwNTJRVW45V1JYd0tXMkhZTHVHUF9QT1ZSY3kxeTJzZjIxV3RIWkhvX1BFc1V6OVJWY2FnVXJhYW1rdWFEN0FFM2dMamQwT2FySnRUQmZGMXEwTEx5dEFiNHRlOHpFUmNtbVVTSXhoXzBWNXBqNndaV2xRZ0RsMVp0Zm1HRTFz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logan Coleridge was used to taking hits in football. He'd been playing since he was 6 years old and had sustained several &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/football-new-helmets-reduce-concussions-cte/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;concussions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But after a helmet-to-helmet impact during his freshman year of high school in August 2023, he started having debilitating symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey teen said he was very dizzy and had trouble balancing. His memory was "terrible," and he had a "severe" light sensitivity, he said, along with "terrible headaches." Previously a strong student, he now struggled to focus in the classroom and couldn't remember school assignments or what he read in class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got concussions in my past, and it wasn't like a normal one," Logan said. "I knew it was something else." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, Logan wasn't getting better. Several months of physical therapy had no effect, said Becky Coleridge, Logan's mom. A neurologist who had been treating Logan since his diagnosis with abdominal migraines the year before prescribed two medications, both of which had negative side effects. An orthopedic doctor suggested looking at his neck. Other practitioners had no answers. Coleridge wanted doctors to prescribe an MRI, but wasn't able to get one. Meanwhile, Logan was missing school almost every week. Over-the-counter medications couldn't dull the headaches, and they were becoming more frequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early spring 2024, Logan was able to see a concussion specialist after a particularly bad headache kept him from going to school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first thing he said was 'Nobody's given this kid an MRI?'" Becky Coleridge remembered. The specialist prescribed the scan, as well as an X-ray of Logan's neck. The Coleridges thought the scans might show Logan had an issue with his occipital nerve, which runs from the neck to the scalp. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were much harder to hear: Logan was diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. It was a condition that he and his parents had never heard of before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything we read was very scary," Becky Coleridge said. "At that moment, we realized the danger he had been in." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an arteriovenous malformation? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain, said Dr. Andrew Russman, head of the Cleveland Clinic's stroke program, who was not involved in Logan's care. AVMs put "a lot of pressure on the vein side" and can produce a variety of symptoms, he said. The biggest risk with an AVM is rupture, where the vessels burst and cause bleeding in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a case like Logan's, where the AVM hasn't ruptured, there can still be symptoms. Those symptoms can affect a person's motor skills, sensory and visual perception, language abilities and the way they walk, Russman said. The effects can vary depending on where in the brain the AVM has formed, Russman said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coleridges had two options to treat Logan: Radiation therapy, a non-invasive technique that uses focused radiation beams to target and slowly destroy the AVM, or surgery. Radiation therapy could take too long, the family decided, and so they decided to have Logan treated by Dr. Howard Riina, a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at NYU Langone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He couldn't go to school. His whole life was impacted by these headaches," Riina said. "They wanted an immediate solution." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riina said the AVM, which was on a "headache spot" in the occipital region of the brain, was likely the root of Logan's symptoms. People are born with AVMs, Riina said, and they grow as the body grows, which can cause increased symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, you don't want to have multiple things going on in your head, but the concussion is what led to the imaging, which led to the diagnosis of the AVM, which was probably what was causing the headaches all along," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness and "focusing on a new beginning" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan underwent surgery on July 17, 2024, nearly a year after his symptoms began. Riina performed a craniotomy and removed the AVM. Three days later, Logan was discharged from the hospital to continue his recovery at home. Logan said it was a "lonely" way to spend his summer vacation. Even as his recovery progressed, he couldn't participate in the sports he loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't really do the things that I love normally doing, like exercising, playing football was a big thing for me. I was just stuck in bed, pretty much having minimal activity," Logan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Logan has only the occasional headache, and the pain can be treated with medication. He has follow-ups at NYU Langone, but Riina said everything has come back clear. The Coleridges are working to encourage early testing: Becky Coleridge said she wishes Logan had received an MRI earlier so that months of suffering and confusion could have been avoided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a complete turnaround, Logan said. He no longer misses school. He celebrated his 16th birthday and took driving lessons. This summer, he spent almost every day at the beach with friends. This month, he's gearing up for a return to the football field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole experience was a fork in the road for me that I had to get through," Logan said. "I'm leaving that time in my life in the past and focusing on a new beginning." &lt;/p&gt;

I was using the family computer and wanted to check my Reddit, and that’s when I found out that Dad has a Reddit account too. I didn’t snoop then, but I did write down his account name and then checked it out on my phone later.&lt;br&gt;I shouldn’t have done that. I should have realized it was private because he had never mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;

They consisted of complaints about his life, how he resents his family, and then feels guilty about feeling so resentful. How he can’t stand Mom anymore but thinks it’s important to put up a good front for us kids, and how he wishes just once his kids would come to him with something other than a problem we expected him to solve. He said some nasty things specifically about me, too, about some personal incidents I don’t want to share here, but that I had shrugged off as just normal interactions—I hadn’t realized how much I had hurt his feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t meant for my eyes, I know. But the thing is, there’s also this undercurrent about how terrible he feels for having these thoughts and feelings and how he needs to “stay strong” for his family. It makes me really uneasy and worried about him. I had no idea he was going through any of this. I feel like I pried open his diary! I don’t know what to do now. Should I just pretend I saw nothing? Or should I tell him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3blgn000253b79eunxdanu@published"&gt;Is there an adult you feel close to, who knows and loves your father—but who is not your mother—with whom you could talk this over? It’s really beyond the scope of what a 15-year-old should be doing for a parent for you to take responsibility for your father’s mental health—and to carry the burden of guilt you now feel for having “snooped.” Of course, if your dad put all of this on Reddit—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your whole family shares one computer—he had to know, at some level, that someone (if not everyone) in the family would read it. At the very least, he was making his confessions in a public space: Reddit is not a diary, as much as it may sometimes feel like one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3bliva002c3b79igstsakc@published"&gt;I don’t know why people reveal their most private thoughts to strangers on the internet (this may be a generational blind spot of mine; I am acquainted with a number of 40-somethings who seem to share &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how private, on Facebook), but I do know that writing about (what sounds like) one’s depression on a shared computer is a not-so-subtle cry for help from those who have access to it. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are not the right person to help him, but his best friend or a sibling of his might be. (And for all you know, he is just using Reddit to blow off steam. Some of those 40-somethings I mentioned definitely use Facebook that way. I read their posts and become alarmed—then learn that they’re just fine, really; they were just having “a dramatic moment.” Again, I’ll acknowledge that this mystifies me. But it is apparently a thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

You might even approach him with something other than a problem for him to solve. It won’t fix him—as I say, it’s not for you to fix him—but it certainly couldn’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

About the only problem in our marriage was his insomnia, and while it was difficult to deal with him getting up 5-6 times a night, every night, it was hardly his fault. Still, after over a decade of trying to treat the insomnia with nothing working except for drugs that had side effects worse than the insomnia itself, we eventually decided on adding a bedroom annex to the home office, and Jeff sleeping there instead of with me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/insomnia-sleep-apart-marriage.html"&gt;Ever since then, he’s been half-assing as a father.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, Werner often sees her patients make the same mistake time and again—they either take too much at once or don’t drink enough water. “Always work up to it slowly, and take plenty of fluids,” she advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, she recommends starting with one small spoonful a day (or less), and then slowly working your way up “day by day, and week by week.” If you notice that you don’t tolerate the psyllium husks well, simply reduce the amount. “One teaspoon to a large glass of water is a good starting point for many people,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Werner does have one caveat—she prefers not to pre-soak her husks, unlike me: “To be honest, I find the goo in water quite disgusting,” she laughs. Instead, she prefers to simply stir the psyllium husks into smoothies, yogurt, or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/oatmeal-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. “I now take one to two teaspoons, sometimes even a tablespoon a day—but I’ve worked my way up to it really slowly,” she say.s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to look for when shopping for psyllium husks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner recommends hulled psyllium husks versus whole psyllium seeds. Since they contain just the outer shell of the seed, “they are usually better tolerated and swell up more,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also advises buying organic quality and checking the list of ingredients: “Ideally, they should really only contain psyllium husks—no additives, no flavorings. This is often a good indicator that the products are less contaminated with harmful substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about? We want to know!

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study from researchers in China analyzed the impact of consuming different types of milk on muscle and bone health while aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study used mice to learn about the relationship between sarcopenia, age-related muscle loss, and four different dairy milks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Findings revealed that goat milk (in particular low-fat goat milk and low-fat fortified goat milk) was more effective at supporting muscle regeneration and reducing inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If it seems like everyone is going wild for protein these days, you're not imagining things. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/2025/consumers-are-seeking-more-protein-for-health-and-taste-in-2025" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cargill’s 2025 Protein Profile&lt;/a&gt;, 61% of Americans increased their protein intake in 2024. As &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/protein-fortified-food-products-market-report" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt; noted in its 2025 report, the "global protein-fortified food products market size was estimated at $66.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $101.62 billion by 2030."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, according to one new study, you may not need to rely solely on pricey protein-fortified foods and powders to support muscle health. Simply switching up the milk you drink every day could help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In July, researchers from Peking University and Hyproca Nutrition in China published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.70540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Food Science &amp;amp; Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, giving greater insight into four dairy products and whether they have the potential to delay the progression of sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Sarcopenia, characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, poses a significant public health challenge. However, the specific role of dairy products in preventing sarcopenia is not well understood," the scientists shared. Studies like this are key to finding solutions for a problem that many of us may face. As one research overview explained, on average, 5–13% of people between 60 and 70 years of age are affected by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060646/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;. For people over 80, that increases to 11–50%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To figure out which dairy products can help stave off sarcopenia, the researchers fed dairy-enriched diets to mice for eight weeks. The mice were split into six groups: normal control, sarcopenia, goat whole milk, goat low-fat milk, goat fortified vitamin D, calcium low-fat milk, and bovine (cow) whole milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The normal control group was given saline throughout the trial — a salt and water solution that acts as a placebo — while the other five groups received dexamethasone injections to induce sarcopenia. At the same time, four groups were fed the milk in their group name. This means that one group did have induced sarcopenia without receiving a dairy supplement, acting as a sarcopenia control group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team then measured the test subjects' grip strength, weight, bone mineral density, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt; (the process that allows your body to reuse and recycle damaged cells), muscle morphology (the size and shape of the muscles), metabolism, inflammation, and gut microbial health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They found that while all types of milk helped the mice regain muscle mass and bone strength, the fortified low-fat goat’s milk — a version with added vitamin D and calcium — was most effective. As the researchers explained, the goat milk boosted muscle-building signals in the body and lowered levels of key inflammation markers linked to muscle loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They also noticed one more critical finding in the gut. All of the dairy-fed mice showed shifts in their microbiome, with increases in the beneficial bacteria Leuconostoc. However, only the goat milk-fed mice showed an increase in Lactococcus and Acinetobacter bacteria, which could help reduce inflammation and support the body's metabolism. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Need all of this boiled down to simpler terms?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This study demonstrates that different types of dairy products have distinct effects on muscle metabolism, autophagy, inflammation, and gut microbiota in sarcopenia," the authors concluded. "Goat milk, particularly its low-fat and vitamin D/calcium-fortified variants, showed greater benefits in promoting muscle regeneration and reducing inflammation compared to bovine milk, highlighting the importance of dairy composition." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to note that many commercial cow milks are fortified with Vitamins A and D, but the researchers do not provide commentary on whether this might come closer to offering the same muscle-regenerating benefits as fortified goat milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was conducted on mice, so the hypothesis has not been proven with humans. Nevertheless, it's one reason to search for goat milk the next time you're strolling through the grocery store or seek out a farmers market to start chatting with your local goat farmer about a regular supply.

Some immunizations are highly recommended for everyone; others may be less critical but worth talking over with a clinician about an individual’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our biggest job as geriatricians is keeping people safe: safe from falls, safe from accidents, safe from abuse — and safe from illnesses that won’t be as severe,” said Dr. Lawrence Ma, a Stanford geriatrician. “Vaccines may not prevent you from getting sick, but they prevent you from getting really sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, vaccines are not having a moment. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long spoken out against certain childhood vaccines, and after taking office, he &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/ousted-vaccine-panel-members-say-rigorous-science-20794645.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;filled the federal immunization advisory board&lt;/a&gt; with members who were vaccine skeptics.

That support probably comes from growing up in a time when illnesses such as polio and measles circulated widely — older adults may have seen firsthand the benefits of immunization. They also may be more generally protective of their increasingly fragile health than other age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot’s changed in the immunization field over the past decade, though — from updated recipes of old shots to brand-new vaccines hitting the market. To help older adults understand which vaccines are available and what they do, Bay Area physicians and infectious disease experts weighed in on their favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pneumoccocal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shot’s on the top of all of the lists, mostly because pneumococcal pneumonia is so deadly for seniors. Until late last year, the shot was recommended for everyone 65 and older — it’s now advised for everyone 50 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pneumococcal vaccine is usually given in one dose to adults, and it protects against multiple bacterial strains. It’s been upgraded over the years to add more strains, and there are now several different formulations available. The vaccine is about 60% to 75% effective against severe illness, and no booster is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pneumococcal was called the ‘old person’s friend’ because it caused people to die very quickly,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UCSF infectious disease expert. The worst complications tend to occur in patients age 75 and up, but even 50-year-olds can have tough outcomes, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine was approved for older adults in 2023 and is now recommended for everyone 75 and older; patients age 50 to 75 should talk to their doctor about getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot, which is given in one dose, is about 85% effective at preventing serious lower-respiratory illness, and at least so far seems to be long-lasting — there is no current booster recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot arrived just as doctors were starting to better appreciate how dangerous RSV could be for older adults, Chin-Hong said. “It was like the bronze medalist of infectious diseases, behind influenza and COVID,” he said. “We didn’t pay much attention to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now RSV is understood to potentially cause much more serious symptoms and complications, particularly in very old adults. One recent study showed a significantly increased risk of stroke or heart attack after patients were hospitalized for RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used to think, ‘It’s just a bad cold,’ but we’re recognizing that these big systemic infections that cause a lot of underlying inflammation can have downstream consequences,” Ma said. “Really the vaccine is there to prevent those big inflammatory cascades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurse Michael Russ II administers a flu shot at the Kaiser adult vaccine clinic in San Francisco last September.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu shots for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu shots for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults 65 and older should get a high-dose or adjuvanted vaccine to give their immune system an extra boost, Chin-Hong said. He added that annual flu shots are more important than getting regular COVID vaccines because influenza mutates so frequently, so people are constantly being exposed to new strains that they are more vulnerable to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also worries about the H5N1 bird flu, which could mutate to better spread among humans — flu shots, he hopes, will prevent it from getting a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current shingles vaccine was approved in 2017 and is recommended for everyone 50 and older. Adults who got the pre-2017 version of the shot should talk to their doctor about getting the newer one, which is about 80% to 90% effective at preventing shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just shingles that the shots protect against, though. Some people who get shingles develop severe nerve pain that can last months or even a year. “One of my patients described it as a constant sunburn,” said Ma, and couldn’t wear a bra for a year. Some patients have had to take strong pain medications for extended periods of time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another potential upshot to the shingles vaccine: Early studies have shown it may protect against dementia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These vaccines are still on the table, but older adults who are up to date on the latest formulation do not need to get a new one. People age 65 and up should get two doses of the current vaccine; those younger should get one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person who is 50 to 65 who is otherwise healthy is going to do fine with COVID because they’ve had so many rounds of exposure,” Chin-Hong said. “Most of the bad stuff in COVID is in people who are older than 75 who didn’t get a shot in the last year. But it’s not a dangerous vaccine, so if someone wants to get it any time, I’m all for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The rest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All adults should stay up to date on their tetanus shots — given every decade — and pertussis, which is given with tetanus. Pertussis generally does not cause severe illness in adults of any age, but it can cause an annoying, long-lasting cough. And the disease can be very serious in infants, so older adults who will be around babies should make sure they’re vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some adults may also need mpox or hepatitis vaccines, but those are generally recommended for certain individuals depending on their background or lifestyle, or only advised during outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, Ma notes that vaccines for older adults are meant not just to save lives but to preserve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any illness can really start the downward spiral,” Ma said. “Even if you don’t die, if you’re sick enough to be bedbound you can lose muscle mass. A younger person may be able to recover from that, but someone who is older and frailer, that could be the very beginning of loss of independence. It could derail your life as it is now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 11:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOdHZGTVpORVJyWDEySlhIMF9pclNJX01HQlBUMFNmdG8zbTA2Uk1Mc2xPT3VQNUFWQjRWR2JPMmpydF9CTGFOLWxKMk1CSXhaaXVFa1ptN3JfLXRGTnA2bzFGa3FyNUhRbm5CQWxDUXJnb1dvMFFqUzdLN3JFVGswYVFZblZyN21xb0NmUVotZENsUWJ6QmE0bjNnWkNSWHc</guid></item><item><title>幼儿父母需要了解的高度传染性夏季疾病- NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QBWJUST3PZE47JS5IMH6MECN7Y"&gt;When summer comes around, you can count on a few things.

For most women, eating more and more protein is not the answer to staying healthy after menopause.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK guidelines recommend adults consume about 0.75g of protein per kilogram of body weight. For the average 72kg woman, that equates to approximately 54g a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts agree this is relatively easy to meet: a typical 150g chicken breast contains around 36g of protein, an egg about 6g, a 170–200g serving of Greek yogurt up to 20g, and a portion of kidney beans between 7g and 10g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet some influencers recommend as much as 150g a day to ‘help prevent’ bone fractures and muscle decline in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one Instagram post, an American doctor with 1.3 million followers outlines a daily meal plan that includes egg whites, protein shakes, beef sticks and large servings of meat – totalling more than 140g of protein. And in a TikTok clip viewed more than 430,000 times a UK-based influencer boasts of eating 130g of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As a personal trainer and a woman navigating perimenopause, I base my meals around some form of protein,’ her caption reads. ‘Our bodies don’t process and metabolise protein the same way as they did in our 20s and 30s, so we need to eat more of it.’ She adds: ‘If I reach 150g, I’m really pleased with myself.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UK guidelines recommend adults consume about 0.75g of protein per kilogram of body weight. For the average 72kg woman, that equates to approximately 54g a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Amati says this approach is misguided. ‘Our protein needs do change over time – but the highest requirement is during infancy and childhood, not menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As we age, we produce less growth hormone, so simply eating more protein doesn’t prevent muscle loss. In fact, studies suggest that higher protein intake after the age of 50 can raise the risk of cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2014 study from the University of Southern California involving more than 6,000 adults over 50 found that a high-protein diet – where protein accounted for roughly 20 per cent of total calories – was linked to increased risks of cancer, diabetes and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults with the highest protein intake were four times more likely to die of cancer compared with those on a low-protein diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research suggests that tumours, including melanoma and breast cancer, may grow faster if a patient is on a high-protein diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, Dr Amati explains, is due to overstimulation of a key cellular pathway responsible for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells – so overactivating this pathway increases the risk,’ she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cancer is the uncontrolledproliferation of cells – so overactivating this pathway increases the risk,’ she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein from animal sources carries additional risks, she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Up to 80 per cent of the protein we eat in the UK comes from animals. But research from Denmark shows that animal protein is richer in certain amino acids that promote fat cell growth and produce compounds linked to heart disease. These amino acids have also been shown to damage cells and tissues, and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, cutting back too far is not advised either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amati says middle-aged women should aim for 1.2g to 1.4g of protein per kg of body weight – more than the NHS guidance, but still easily achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also encourages shifting towards plant-based protein sources, which help boost fibre intake. These include beans, peas, nuts, seeds and oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I started a GLP-1 injection, paying $550 a month out of pocket that insurance wouldn’t cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEV6NURXNVA6LK4NHFIKCNXNKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The weight began to drop, but soon I was breathless again just making my bed or showering.

But it worked, the anemia was resolved, and my hematologist wrote in my chart: “Patient says she can’t remember the last time she felt this good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GUCV6IMEBFEWHOJKSBZ4VGYGRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But by fall, I had severe hot flashes, night sweats and persistent insomnia. Again, I went for tests. My thyroid was fine, and my hormones did not indicate menopause. My chart notes read: “Weight.

I’d lost all the weight, but I cried explaining how my body felt hijacked by relentless dread and anxiety. She prescribed a beta blocker for my racing heart and, crucially, drew blood for new tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NDMAFOXZFZACXGMVHOIFQVVVRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next day she messaged me: “Your calcium is elevated.

They have one job: to regulate the calcium and phosphorus in your blood. Calcium builds bones and teeth, but it’s also the electrical current powering the heart, muscles and brain and is essential for nerve signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLQQUPQVIBC45DACF6B6U3O7OQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If even one of those glands goes rogue, often because a benign tumor raises the parathyroid hormone, it tricks the body into pulling more calcium from bones, weakening the skeleton, damaging kidneys, disrupting heart function and altering mood. It also comes with a&lt;a href="https://www.hyperparathyroidmd.com/hyperparathyroidism-symptoms/" target="_blank"&gt; host of possible symptoms&lt;/a&gt;: fatigue, insomnia, thirst, memory issues, hair loss — symptoms doctors call “nonspecific” because they &lt;a href="https://www.southwestparathyroid.com/blog/why-your-doctor-doesn-t-recognize-the-symptoms-of-parathyroid-disease#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20%E2%80%9Cstones%2C%20bones,just%20%E2%80%9Cmild%E2%80%9D%20calcium%20elevations." target="_blank"&gt;overlap with hundreds of other conditions&lt;/a&gt;.

Historically, PHPT was diagnosed by late-stage symptoms: kidney stones or fractures. Now, routine blood tests catch elevated calcium levels earlier. (Some experts warn that calcium even &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drmichaelljohnson1/video/7355875607881796910?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZT-8y55OxCg31p" target="_blank"&gt;at 10 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; can signal trouble.) But this means many patients now present with “nonspecific” symptoms, so doctors may ignore mildly elevated calcium and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-bad-diagnosis/2015/08/24/b17606c2-12ac-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;miss the parathyroid connection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4FYDURXTJHE3HFSMS3JDZ3JBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article/37/11/2293/7512381" target="_blank"&gt; standard of care&lt;/a&gt; for elevated calcium is clear: Repeat the calcium test, and check the parathyroid hormone.

(It’s important to find a highly skilled surgeon, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3224988/" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; the outcomes are better if you use a doctor who performs more than 50 of these procedures each year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E5ZGJDJADZH3ZFOBALEVXN3UUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My PTH dropped to normal within minutes, confirming success.

I can’t get back the years — or probably the inches — I lost.

&lt;p id="4df4167d-f126-44e4-a9b2-76e97188d22d"&gt;I’ll start this article with a strong caveat — I’m not a personal trainer or a walking coach, I’m a fitness editor and enthusiast, who reviews gear and tests new workouts for a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the fitness world, I’ve recently been swept up in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked"&gt;Japanese walking method&lt;/a&gt; hype, and it’s changed my walking workouts for good, but after a month, I found myself thinking, what's next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="4df4167d-f126-44e4-a9b2-76e97188d22d-2"&gt;In order to get fitter and stronger, you need to keep progressing your workouts. With walking workouts, this is pretty easy — you simply walk faster, add weight in the form of a weighted vest (or in my case, a baby strapped to your torso in a sling), walk up hill, or increase the time you spend walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you’re looking for a new walking workout to try this summer, why not give my 3-4-5 walking method a go? Read on to find out exactly how to do it. As a reminder, if you’re returning to workouts following an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to get signed off by a medical professional before taking on a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-70a14b3f-17db-4684-a743-60acdfe3b071" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-3-4-5-walking-workout-3"&gt;What is the 3-4-5 walking workout? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="004b0b89-2a3f-4b95-9e1a-8d7c0144ccfd"&gt;Similar to the Japanese Walking Method, my 3-4-5 workout is also a form of HIIT training that involves changing the pace throughout the session.

This should be a 4/10 effort — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then walk four minutes at a high intensity. This is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat this 5 times. You’ll walk for 35 minutes in total.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="2b36b008-297d-4930-9fb4-d9c4d742ff09"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-799f9042-f7b3-4fc6-9005-0a73073bdb82" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-ve-been-doing-the-3-4-5-walking-workout-for-a-week-here-are-the-benefits-3"&gt;I’ve been doing the 3-4-5 walking workout for a week — here are the benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="da3d684a-cbcf-4b95-9e34-11cdf837f6b8"&gt;As you might have spotted, this progresses the Japanese walking method by increasing the time spent walking at a faster pace and adding five minutes to the workout. Here’s what I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-extra-60-seconds-of-work-makes-all-the-difference"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The extra 60 seconds of work makes all the difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="05345aab-ff78-48d5-ab54-91ec38dd03d5"&gt;60 seconds doesn’t sound like a long time, until you’re having to power through another minute of walking at a fast pace. The extra minute of work made this feel like a step up from the three-minute intervals involved in the Japanese walking method. It’s enough to keep your heart rate elevated for a little bit longer, and I felt like I’d worked harder and burned more calories during this walking workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of adding intervals to your walks is raising your heart rate. This helps lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and increases your aerobic capacity compared to walking continuously at a moderate pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re also likely to burn more calories than you would if you just walked at a moderate pace for 35 minutes, which is useful if you're &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking"&gt;walking for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-knowing-how-many-times-i-was-repeating-the-intervals-helped" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-knowing-how-many-times-i-was-repeating-the-intervals-helped"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowing how many times I was repeating the intervals helped &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="e2bb837d-8ff9-47d3-8f71-012f8327305c"&gt;I’ve run five marathons, and one thing that always gets me through the final miles is counting. From mile 20, I’ll count each step to 100, then start again, or work out how many minutes of running I have left and count down. It helps keep my mind busy when the going gets tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also use a similar technique in my speed workouts when running, counting down the intervals, work, or laps of the track left. I liked counting down from five during this workout — knowing I only had one interval or four minutes of work left allowed me to push my pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-it-raised-my-heart-rate-and-boosted-my-mood" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-raised-my-heart-rate-and-boosted-my-mood"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It raised my heart rate and boosted my mood &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="5f077647-65d7-4fa2-b0d3-fe9c902cda56"&gt;I’m not walking to lose weight, but using it as a way to rebuild my fitness postpartum, and keep moving on days when my toddler doesn’t go to daycare, and I can’t head out for a run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a great form of active recovery, and stops my legs getting too stiff between running and strength training sessions. I have to walk my dog every day, so why not mix it up and make it more of a workout?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as raising my heart rate and leaving me feeling like I’d done a workout, not just rambled along with a podcast, my 3-4-5 walking workout left me with all those happy, post-workout endorphins flowing through my body before I sat down at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun challenge, and one you can do for free, from anywhere. Do it on a treadmill, with a friend or a dog, in your local park, or up a hill if you want to really work your legs. All you need is a comfy pair of sneakers and 35 minutes.

It was the early ’90s, and I’d been suffering from the headaches—often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, occasionally somewhat eased by ibuprofen—since the age of 14. I can’t recall why on that day I decided to request an appointment, but I can still see the doctor fumbling with the wrapping of a cartridge encasing a hypodermic needle filled with a new drug. She got migraines, too, she’d told me, so when she placed the cartridge on my arm and pressed the button delivering the shot, we both exhibited the curious anticipation of experimenters, wondering if something miraculous was in the offing.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6ydo000o357afbb0aip8@published"&gt;It was. Within five minutes, the nagging throb that had bloomed on my right temple a few hours earlier had vanished. That made us both giddy. Whether the new drug, sumatriptan (marketed as Imitrex), also worked for that doctor, I’ll never know. But I was lucky. Over the decades that followed, sumatriptan has reliably tamed the migraines that have intermittently plagued me, rescuing me from countless hours of misery. Whenever anyone complains about Big Pharma or fantasizes about having been born in an earlier era, my ironclad response is that I can’t imagine my life without sumatriptan—or, rather, I can, and the thought is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

As the journalist Tom Zeller Jr. recounts in his illuminating new book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2181/9780358507758"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Headache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people with migraines or cluster headaches (Zeller’s own affliction) often find that recommended treatments either don’t work or decline in effectiveness over the course of months. Cluster headaches, like migraines, are called “primary headaches,” Zeller explains, “meaning the head pain and accompanying battery of other neurological effects constitute disorders unto themselves, rather than symptoms of some other underlying disease.” Even the fairly common migraine is poorly understood by those who don’t get them. I once worked with a colleague who was convinced I was being careless with my health because I didn’t regard my headaches as symptoms of some grave condition that could, and ought, to be cured.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6z8s0010357ajbw46zyr@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Headache&lt;/em&gt; is an account of what we have learned about migraine and cluster headaches (less than you’d think) and the state of research developing treatments. The newest of those treatments are blockers that inhibit the uptake of calcitonin gene-related peptide, CGRP, a “key chemical messenger in the nervous system’s pain communication pathway,” according to Zeller. Researchers knew that CGRP could induce migraines in experimental subjects (all praise the sacrifices of those heroes!), and this new class of drugs binds to the chemical to prevent it from binding to neural receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zbb0011357a7sdg11tr@published"&gt;Cluster headaches are relatively rare, but migraines are not, and one study calculated the cost to the U.S. economy of migraines alone is as much as $1 trillion. Yet research into the causes and cures for primary headaches has been sluggish, for reasons that are highly contested. While the medical explanations in &lt;em&gt;The Headache&lt;/em&gt; occasionally made my eyes glaze over, Zeller’s accounts of feuds among headache researchers and their combined wrath at what they insist is inadequate National Institutes of Health funding for their work offers a delectable blend of dish and substance. When one scientist likened migraine research to a massive Airbus plane requiring four fully fueled engines to get it off the ground, Zeller asked him what, exactly, was keeping the plane on the tarmac. “Too many female passengers,” was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zhk0012357akvwvuqfc@published"&gt;Female migraineurs outnumber their male counterparts by 3 to 1, while the gender breakdown is reversed for cluster headaches. Many headache experts believe that this explains why migraine isn’t taken seriously by the medical establishment, whose tendency to dismiss pain in female patients has been well documented. Zeller observes that cluster headache sufferers, by contrast, tend to hide their condition, something he himself did during an early stint at the New York Times&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Headache&lt;/em&gt; includes the story of an air traffic controller who concealed his cluster headaches for three decades, knowing that the condition would trigger an automatic medical disqualification from a job he loved. He resorted to keeping his medications (which did not impair his performance) secret and ducking out of work during an episode to inhale oxygen from a tank he kept in his car.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="187" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zjs0013357awcsrulpp@published"&gt;For Zeller’s part, he found it difficult to admit how debilitated he was by a disorder that many people conflate with the discomfort caused by a hangover. Cluster headaches, however, are often ranked among the worst pain a human can experience. While migraineurs tend to retreat to dark quiet rooms to wait out their affliction, people with cluster headaches are restless, often pacing, rocking, and pounding their heads. While cluster headaches don’t last all day like a migraine, they can recur every day or multiple times per day within the window of a period that can last weeks or months, followed by a period of remission. In &lt;em&gt;The Headache, &lt;/em&gt;Zeller relates the story of a young man whose cluster headaches proved so relentless and tormenting that he took his own life, grimly confirming the disorder’s nickname: suicide headaches. Zeller himself recounts a period when, while working on a demanding story, he experienced a cluster attack and resorted to “medicating myself with absurd tides of chemical experimentation and excess,” ranging from caffeine, steroids, and magnesium to a CGRP blocker called verapamil—a drug on which he overdosed, passing out.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zm60014357aorphcbgz@published"&gt;Though we have different kinds of headaches, there’s much that’s familiar to me in Zeller’s account. I, too, have found it difficult to convey just how disabling a mere headache can be. And I certainly recognized Zeller’s almost superstitious hoarding of medication doses, splitting them to stretch the supply, and the way Zeller would “jealously count those blue injections like a Scrooge, worrying over their limited number, wondering whether they’d last.” These drugs are the treasure we require to placate an angry god. Insurance companies can be stingy with the number of doses they allow per month, so it’s imperative to keep renewing the prescription regularly, even in the absence of headaches, so that you hit any future bad period with an ample supply. The fear of running out is petrifying—although, thankfully, well in the past for me now that sumatriptan has gone generic and can be bought online. The more recently developed CGRP blockers, however, can be brutally expensive. And most primary headache medications only work for half the people who try them, and then often only half the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zom0015357akhjz65q4@published"&gt;Maddeningly, scientists still can’t say what causes primary headaches. Fierce debate rages among them over whether these are disorders of the vascular system—dilated blood vessels pressing against nerves—or of the central nervous system, arising from some dysfunction in the brain. The hypothalamus, which regulates the autonomic nervous system, seems implicated in cluster headaches, with their mysterious link to the body’s circadian rhythms. Migraines vary widely from person to person, but also in the same person during the course of a lifetime. My migraines once were synced to hormonal cycles. Now they only come at night, and especially when it rains or the humidity tops 75 percent. Or when my blood sugar gets too low. Or when I drink wine. I never experienced migraine aura—a disturbance in vision—until about 15 years ago. Now, my eyesight will occasionally be marred by a crescent of shimmering silver triangles (a classic migraine aura), but with no subsequent headache attached.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zr30016357aowvy3zdh@published"&gt;No wonder headache scientists are stumped, although several of the sources Zeller spoke with also complained that the stigma attached to primary headaches as an “unserious” medical condition has kept gifted researchers away from the field. Former NIH director Story Landis told Zeller that the agency—which has demonstrably underfunded headache research relative to the impact primary headaches have on society—simply didn’t get enough high-quality grant proposals in the area. Landis suggested, Zeller writes, “that headache researchers had been poorly conditioned by industry to focus on pills and shots, rather than foundational science,” such as identifying the cause or causes of the disorders. But if Big Pharma is the only source of funding for headache research, who can blame them?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3a6zti0017357aojan5x70@published"&gt;When an advocate for headache sufferers asked Zeller what he’d learned in all his admirably extensive research for &lt;em&gt;The Headache,&lt;/em&gt; the author found himself stammering and backtracking, qualifying his own suffering as not “the worst of what cluster headaches can inflict on a person,” adding that “there are bigger problems.” Then he pulled up. For millions of people of all races and genders—including Zeller himself!—primary headaches are a literal torment. Though I seldom endure that myself now, I remember all too well what a full-blown migraine was like. “It’s not just a headache” is the answer Zeller finally comes up with, and on that we should all &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;agree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the vaccine was only approved for children with one or more health conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid. This move could limit access to Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We already have a low number of people using the vaccines to start with,” Benjamin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There hasn’t been enough promotion of vaccinations for kids, and then you have Mr [Robert F] Kennedy’s [Jr] unscientific statements about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, particularly Covid vaccines, for both pregnant women and kids.

				&lt;h1&gt;Confirmed Rabid Fox Bites Atmore Resident; Second Person Also Being Treated&lt;/h1&gt;

		
	
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northescambia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rabiesalert11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-593487" title="rabiesalert11" src="http://www.northescambia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rabiesalert11-540x258.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Escambia resident was attacked and bitten by a fox on August 7 outside the victim’s residence on Highway 31 in Atmore. Another person was present at the time of the incident and came in direct physical contact with the fox. The Escambia County Sheriff’s Department was notified of the incident, and a rabies investigation was begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox was taken to the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) Bureau of Clinical Laboratories, where it was confirmed positive for rabies. Rabies is a viral disease that can be fatal if untreated. Both persons are receiving appropriate medical attention, and the victim is receiving post-exposure prophylaxis. No additional exposures have been identified at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although rabies is primarily found in wild animals, since widespread vaccination of domestic animals began over 70 years ago, it continues to be a risk and a public health threat,” Dr. Dee W. Jones, State Public Health Veterinarian, said. “Although attacks such as this by rabid wildlife are rather uncommon, it highlights the risk rabies continues to pose and hopefully reminds people to be aware of the risks and continue to vaccinate their pets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very common for domestic animals and pets to have contact with a wild rabid animal. Alabama state law requires that dogs, cats and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccines are also available for horses and other livestock if recommended by a veterinarian. Vaccinating animals reduces the risk of rabies infection should exposure occur; thus, vaccinations protect animals, as well as their owners and caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;

An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) found PFAS in the blood of an estimated 97% of Americans. These chemicals have been linked to cancer, cardiovascular and liver diseases, and immune suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS are persistent because most can take years to leave the body, and while they are there, they can do some serious damage to your health because they constantly recirculate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver sends PFAS substances &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-offer-new-hope-against-forever-chemicals/"&gt;into the intestines&lt;/a&gt;, and transport proteins pull some back into the bloodstream. A similar recapture can occur in the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-t-be-that-easy"&gt;It can’t be that easy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After asking what people can do about PFAS, a team tested a simple option using a very common and readily available &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-enough-fiber-prevents-cancer-in-a-surprising-way/"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt;: soluble, gel-forming fiber taken with meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two recent pilot studies suggest that regularly consuming such fiber can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/aquatic-life-criteria-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PFOA&lt;/a&gt; (perfluorooctanoic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/aquatic-life-criteria-perfluorooctane-sulfonate-pfos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PFOS&lt;/a&gt; (perfluorooctane sulfonate) – two of the most studied PFAS in a family of over 15,000 human-made chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work involves Professor Dhimiter Bello, associate dean of research in the &lt;a href="https://www.uml.edu/health-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at UML, and Professor of Environmental Health Jennifer Schlezinger at &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By consuming gel-forming fibers such as psyllium with a meal, we can trap PFAS inside the fiber gel, which can then be removed in feces,” explains Bello, whose lab developed methods for measuring PFAS in human tissues and biological fluids while documenting PFAS exposure sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Professor Schlezinger and I have complementary expertise, a shared common interest and the same drive to produce impactful research,” says Bello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-pfas-reacts-with-fiber"&gt;How PFAS reacts with fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used male mice on diets modeled after typical U.S. eating patterns. Some received inulin as a control fiber and others received &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00189.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oat beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, a soluble dietary fiber found naturally in the cell walls of oats, as the test fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice drank water containing a mix of seven PFAS for six weeks, then switched to clean water for four weeks to see how much PFAS cleared during this washout period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the beta-glucan mice &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-found-in-tap-and-bottled-water-worldwide/"&gt;drank more water&lt;/a&gt;, they took in more PFAS. The team adjusted the results to account for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the adjustment, their blood levels of PFOA and PFOS trended lower (p &amp;lt; 0.1). These mice also had a slightly lower body fat percentage and lower fat in the liver and small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS turned on some liver genes that help process chemicals; after the clean-water period, only one of those genes, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/13112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cyp3a11&lt;/a&gt;, moved back toward normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-fiber-reduces-pfas"&gt;Why fiber reduces PFAS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the better-known PFAS, like PFOA and PFOS, have been linked to higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, lower vaccine responses, and certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fibers such as beta-glucan and psyllium form gels in the gut that can bind bile acids. That action is known to help lower LDL cholesterol by pushing the body to make new bile acids instead of reusing old ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PFAS share some chemical features with bile acids, trapping them in the same gel is a reasonable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a scientist, I had a life-meets-science moment while looking for ways to control bad cholesterol,” says Schlezinger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In published research studies, I found that consuming gel-forming fibers can increase the elimination of bile acids, which in turn reduces cholesterol in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver then pulls cholesterol out of the blood to replace the lost bile acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It occurred to me that bile acids and PFAS have similar &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-strain-identified-that-can-eat-forever-chemicals/"&gt;chemical characteristics&lt;/a&gt;, and both are recirculated between the liver, the bile and the gut,” Schlezinger continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-migrating-from-mice-to-people"&gt;Migrating from mice to people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research linked high-fiber eating patterns with lower PFAS levels. The new pilot work tested fiber supplements with meals, using beta-glucan and psyllium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one pilot study, the researchers documented an 8% decrease in PFOS and PFOA after four weeks among people who took a fiber supplement. The researchers are running additional studies to replicate the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increasing fiber intake with a supplement could be a win-win situation, reducing PFAS in the body with a supplement that’s available and economical,” Schlezinger enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before beginning any fiber supplement routine, however, you should consult with your physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-all-came-together"&gt;How it all came together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the two universities started as part of a larger effort to build research capabilities for PFAS biomonitoring and develop solutions to the PFAS &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-popular-beers-in-the-u-s-contain-forever-chemicals/"&gt;contamination problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding from a &lt;a href="https://www.uml.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMass Lowell&lt;/a&gt; seed grant allowed Bello to develop laboratory methods for quantifying PFAS in tissues, blood, stool, and urine in support of the pilot studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within three years, we amended our analytical method twice to expand biomonitoring from an initial list of 15 common targets to about 50 PFAS,” says Bello. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we built additional expertise to conduct untargeted PFAS analysis and offered in-kind PFAS testing to several research groups to promote initial data generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-fiber-and-human-health"&gt;PFAS, fiber, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS are everywhere and stubbornly stick around, but this research points to a practical, low-cost way to nudge them out: take gel-forming soluble fiber like psyllium or beta-glucan with meals to trap PFAS in the gut and send them out of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now testing novel and inexpensive PFAS removal and detoxification strategies such as multiple fibers, different diets, and cholestyramine – a medication used to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of PFAS testing continues to change as labs refine methods and standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With thousands of PFAS species in use, we as a society have a long way to go before we can claim that we have fully understood the real scope of PFAS exposures to humans and the environment and their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-increase-cancer-risk-by-up-to-33/"&gt;health impact&lt;/a&gt;,” Bello concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s early, not a cure-all, and anyone considering supplements should talk to a clinician, but the signal is promising and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041008X24003879?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01165-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 23:38:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOMEVieWJCREdRdTRrVXJJamlYSTNfSDFiM2pIc0JwWjNWSXNqU3h4Q01YWEJQTk0tclptalBXRnZUbHhjazhQa2JMOFg5aEM5bGowdFZsTF9XU1FvWm52eDBZNXh6T3FSLXMtc3U5eWVqSlVDeUZDZEcxQXpUNXhqUmpkbnFFR2JfUnlmVTItZHhJS1ItTUcxRFRmbEtRS1dBNmtRemVLa0dYd2k4WGc</guid></item><item><title>在柯林斯堡发现头上长着“触手”或“角”的兔子- 9News.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNM0VzNFNoTlpjR2lVeTJyeFdXVmY1aE5Lc1Z0WHRXLTZUSUxvcGt0X1JEOGRwbGNzQzl3ajRKOTFqcWZRdlZFVmR3U3J3dkxTNmNRR1pRTWxXNUFGaENDcW12UzhaN1otRTQyUmpMODhlNzJNU1YyMS1RVGR4OUNOaGd2MEh1ZlF0OWpQbF80R0VzWFpNRXMyRmhkbFROaHd3a0E5YmlvM1RzZUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;p data-start="155" data-end="1073"&gt;Somewhere between corporate life and grocery delivery, I drifted into the single‑serve snack aisle and forgot that lesson — until last spring, when a routine health check told me my daily handful of neon‑orange crisps had turned into a full‑fledged habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="155" data-end="1073"&gt;I opened a cupboard that evening and realized nothing &lt;em data-start="676" data-end="686"&gt;crunched&lt;/em&gt; without crinkling plastic first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="155" data-end="1073"&gt;That epiphany met a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-024-00020-7.pdf"&gt;Nature headline &lt;/a&gt;on my feed: home cooks eat far fewer ultra‑processed snacks and load up on nutrient‑dense whole foods instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="155" data-end="1073"&gt;The science echoed my nostalgia, so I began reviving nine old‑school snack habits—each one stepped, storied, and rooted in new research that shows why the comeback matters more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1075" data-end="1114"&gt;1. Sunday‑batch stove‑top popcorn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1115" data-end="2096"&gt;When I was twelve, Dad counted kernels into a pot like loose change, then waited for the first pop before he shook the pan in joyful paranoia: &lt;em data-start="1258" data-end="1282"&gt;don’t burn, don’t burn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1115" data-end="2096"&gt;I’ve resurrected that ritual, but I season a week’s worth at once — smoked paprika on Monday, cinnamon‑cacao on Tuesday, nutritional yeast mid‑week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1115" data-end="2096"&gt;Making popcorn this way forces me to watch, listen, and eventually cut the heat before the last kernel risks scorching—built‑in mindful eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1115" data-end="2096"&gt;Planning snacks in advance is more than quaint — &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/snacking/"&gt;Harvard nutrition experts&lt;/a&gt; note that prepping go‑to items like popcorn, nuts, or yogurt ahead of time reins in calories, evens out hunger, and slips extra nutrients into an otherwise grab‑and‑go day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1115" data-end="2096"&gt;A single Sunday pot fills four mason jars cheaper than one supermarket multipack, and because the seasoning lives on the kernel, I don’t reflexively shovel handful after handful—the flavor’s intense enough to slow me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2098" data-end="2148"&gt;2. Apple arcs with two‑ingredient nut butter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;On a high‑school field trip, my friend Hana unveiled a tiny metal tin: thin apple slices fanned around a dollop of peanut butter she’d blended at home with nothing but peanuts and a drizzle of maple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;Decades later, I’ve upgraded the butter — half roasted almonds, half hazelnuts, blitzed with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;The apples get cut into crescent “arcs” my daughter learned from a YouTube geometry video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;They still brown, and that’s fine — we dip faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/04/home-cooking-and-minimally-processed-foods-best-for-weight-loss-upf-study-finds"&gt;eight‑week trial&lt;/a&gt; reported that volunteers eating scratch‑cooked, minimally processed meals shed twice the weight and clocked 290 fewer daily calories than peers on an ultra‑processed diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;Homemade nut butter dodges the added oils and stabilizers that can turn a healthy dip into a dessert. Step by step: roast nuts 10 minutes, cool, blend until runny, store in small jars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2149" data-end="3160"&gt;A spoonful over apples beats vending‑machine candy for staying power—protein, fiber, and a crunch that sounds like biting into self‑respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3162" data-end="3215"&gt;3. Chili‑lime roasted chickpeas for the commute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3216" data-end="4019"&gt;My first grown‑up job had a 40‑minute train ride flanked by pastry kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3216" data-end="4019"&gt;One mentor—an accountant named Luis—always popped crunchy chickpeas instead. “Keeps the spreadsheets away,” he joked. I now roast two cans of chickpeas every Wednesday: pat dry, toss with olive oil, smoked paprika, lime zest, and sea salt; bake at 400 °F until brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3216" data-end="4019"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/processed-foods-and-health-sacns-rapid-evidence-update/processed-foods-and-health-sacns-rapid-evidence-update-summary"&gt;UK Scientific Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt; on Nutrition’s 2025 rapid evidence update urges cutting back on processed snack packs heavy in sugar, salt, and saturated fat; homemade pulses sidestep that red‑flag trio entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3216" data-end="4019"&gt;Roasted chickpeas ride well in a pocket‑sized jar; they’re humble but heroic—protein to curb the 5 p.m. drive‑thru lure, fiber to delay the next hunger bell, and a flavor punch that makes savored bites, not autopilot grazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4021" data-end="4075"&gt;4. Rainbow veggie sticks with kid‑whipped hummus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;Years ago, my niece refused carrots unless they came pre‑shaped like cartoon stars. Then we tried a parent‑child cooking class that let her blitz chickpeas and lemon in a child‑safe mini‑processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;She licked the spoon, claimed ownership, and—statistically unsurprising—ate the carrots too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/22/4851"&gt;2023 parent‑child cooking program&lt;/a&gt; showed that when children prepare snacks, their vegetable intake rises meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;Every Friday, my own daughter lines up rainbow veggie sticks—purple carrot, yellow pepper, green cucumber—while I set out garlic, tahini, and chickpeas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;We taste as we blend: more lemon? extra cumin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;The hummus thickens, pride balloons, and a plateful of raw produce disappears faster than a gaming livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt;: rinse chickpeas, blitz with tahini, water, lemon, garlic, salt; slice veggies; eat immediately or pack into lunch tins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4076" data-end="4975"&gt;Ownership is the secret seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4977" data-end="5035"&gt;5. Yogurt‑parfait jars with “choose‑your‑own crunch”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;In college, I bought parfaits layered in plastic cups—granola glued to the lid, fruit puree at the bottom. They felt fancy until the label revealed more sugar than a glazed doughnut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;My 2025 revival uses plain Greek yogurt spooned into glass jars on Sunday night, topped with frozen berries (they thaw by lunch), and sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;The crunch stays separate: toasted oats, pumpkin seeds, and a dark‑chocolate shaving stashed in a tiny side tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;When afternoon slump hits, I assemble, swirl, and taste a dessert disguised as nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;Again, Harvard’s snacking guidelines highlight portion‑controlled, protein‑rich options like yogurt to keep hunger predictable and nutrients high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5937"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The step‑by‑step is foolproof&lt;/strong&gt;: toast oats for five minutes, cool, store; layer jars; pack. Cost per serving: less than the price of a gas‑station latte, and the jar’s weight reminds me to take it slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5939" data-end="5996"&gt;6. Cinnamon‑dusted frozen banana “nice‑cream” coins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5997" data-end="6795"&gt;During a heatwave childhood, Mom froze banana halves on sticks; we bit into icy centers and pretended we were at the county fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5997" data-end="6795"&gt;My adult freezer now holds banana “coins”: sliced rounds tossed in cinnamon, frozen on parchment, then bagged. They taste like mini ice‑cream bites but register as fruit in any ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5997" data-end="6795"&gt;The earlier UCL trial’s calorie gap was partly credited to reduced high‑sugar extras when people cooked from scratch—frozen bananas are Exhibit A of scratch dessert that replaces pint‑diving at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5997" data-end="6795"&gt;Portion planning—one small handful in a ramekin—echoes Harvard’s note that pre‑planned servings tame calories without joy‑thieving austerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5997" data-end="6795"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiny steps:&lt;/strong&gt; slice ripe bananas, dust with cinnamon, freeze flat, transfer to reuseable bag. Midnight craving solved; spoon unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6797" data-end="6830"&gt;7. DIY “campfire” trail mix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6831" data-end="7653"&gt;I once paid airport prices for a designer trail mix that turned out to be mostly chocolate‑coated cereal. Now I recreate the campfire mixes of youth groups: equal parts roasted almonds, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, chopped dried apricot, and a smattering of dark chocolate shards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6831" data-end="7653"&gt;The Nature Research that I mentioned above spotlight on home cooking notes that people who prep snacks at home naturally gravitate to whole, nutrient‑dense ingredients and dodge the engineered bliss points of ultra‑processed blends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6831" data-end="7653"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step‑wise&lt;/strong&gt;: roast nuts at 325 °F for ten minutes, cool, combine with unsweetened fruit, store in screw‑top jars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6831" data-end="7653"&gt;Portion into micro‑bags before a hike or long Zoom day; the pre‑split servings check the “planning” box the Harvard team says curbs mindless handfuls. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6831" data-end="7653"&gt;he result tastes like a forest walk and chews like accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7655" data-end="7711"&gt;8. Whole‑grain toast soldiers with smashed avocado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7712" data-end="8453"&gt;Toast “soldiers” were my grandmother’s trick for toddlers — fingers of toast dunked in soft‑boiled egg. I’ve modernized the idea: wide fingers of seeded whole‑grain bread toasted crisp, topped with smashed avocado, lime, and chili flakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7712" data-end="8453"&gt;They store surprisingly well wrapped in wax paper for three hours—perfect for school pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7712" data-end="8453"&gt;The UK rapid review’s warning about processed snack packs hits hardest in children’s lunchboxes; mini toasts sidestep that sodium‑sugar pitfall while teaching the palate to enjoy fat’s satiety when it comes wrapped in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7712" data-end="8453"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt;: toast bread, mash avocado with lime and salt, spread, slice into “soldiers,” wrap. They offer handheld calm—chewy, fatty, tart—and keep me from raiding the drive‑thru chip tray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8455" data-end="8515"&gt;9. Oven‑dried fruit leather you can actually pronounce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8516" data-end="9287"&gt;As a kid I loved neon fruit rolls that stuck to my teeth until Halloween. But their ingredient list reads like a chemistry set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8516" data-end="9287"&gt;This comeback item sprang from a rainy Saturday experiment: purée ripe peaches and strawberries, spread thin on a silicone mat, and bake at 175 °F for four hours until tacky. Cut into strips, roll in parchment, stash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8516" data-end="9287"&gt;The Nature home‑cooking report plus the SACN review both hammer the same nail—ultra‑processed sweets pack hidden sugars and additives; homemade treats give sweetness with fiber attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8516" data-end="9287"&gt;Planning portioned rolls means I don’t inhale a whole bag of gummy candy while editing late at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8516" data-end="9287"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step‑wise&lt;/strong&gt;: blend fruit, sweeten only if absolutely necessary, spread, bake low, cool, slice, roll. Flavor? Think sunset in paper form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9289" data-end="9358"&gt;Final words: from research to real life—why the revival matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9359" data-end="9920"&gt;Reviving these nine snack habits didn’t just trim plastic or novelty; it rewired my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9359" data-end="9920"&gt;Preparing snacks ahead satisfied the Harvard checklist for portion control, while the Nature and UCL findings played out in real time—I stopped defaulting to vending‑machine options and felt my afternoon energy stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9359" data-end="9920"&gt;Watching my daughter whirl hummus echoed the MDPI study on kids cooking: her carrot intake skyrocketed without a single lecture. And every time I roasted chickpeas instead of cracking open a foil bag, I imagined the UK scientists nodding approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9922" data-end="10388"&gt;The common denominator is agency. Homemade snacks put my hands back in the story, turning feed‑scroll cravings into small, tactile rituals: shaking popcorn, peeling fruit leather, dusting banana coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9922" data-end="10388"&gt;Research may validate the benefits, but the lived reward is quieter: the smell of cinnamon when I crack open a jar at 3 p.m., the pride in my kid’s eyes when she packs her rainbow veggies, the almost meditative hush that falls when kernels pop in an even rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10390" data-end="10732"&gt;So here’s the plan B to processed snacking fatigue: pick one habit, prep it this weekend, and notice how the craving conversation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10390" data-end="10732"&gt;Science says it’ll help your waistline; experience says it will also feed parts of you an algorithm can’t measure—memory, presence, and the silent joy of hearing frogs and knowing it’s time to turn left.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the California department of public health’s own wastewater tracking&lt;/a&gt;, statewide infection numbers have now surpassed winter highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other metrics are also showing increases in the illness. As of Tuesday, the CDC estimates Covid-19 infections are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;growing or probably growing in 45 states&lt;/a&gt;, which is up from 40 last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A new Covid-19 variant, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;XFG, or “Stratus”&lt;/a&gt;, is on the rise in the US, becoming the third-most common strain of the summer. The variant was first detected in south-east Asia in January but was barely detected in the US until May. By late June, it was estimated to account for up to 14%, according to the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-cases-rise-summer-2025-cdc-data/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS interview&lt;/a&gt; in July, physician Jon LaPook said that this type of rise was typical for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We now know that there’s a winter spike and then there’s a summer spike,” the outlet’s chief medical correspondent said in the interview. “And every year, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that’s the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, experts caution it is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/us-covid-cases-rising" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;too soon to know how big the developing late-summer wave&lt;/a&gt; could get. While cases are rising more slowly than at the start of previous surges, varied immune responses from prior infections and vaccinations make it difficult to predict how severe illnesses could be. The risks are further compounded by new vaccine restrictions from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rise in Covid-19 cases comes as the US Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday it will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, raising questions about the safety of a technology credited with helping end the pandemic and saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 22:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPZC1QOWdZN2hVWlhwVFRGUUtlXzBLZ1FDcE43Tm85Q1lrLXFYMENpamJLcWUycVIzX0FKYzl5cGhQMldubVdCNkU0WXJGQkpXdmJmNncwVWgyUEdmRi1JRzdUb1FIQk0xMUJ6eE5jb0tIcl9VbkxweTIxaVBEZ3pGV2dSNjk3MHBWNllN</guid></item><item><title>在热门度假目的地发生更多致命的“食肉”细菌感染病例- FOX 13 Tampa Bay</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPdXpacW9NVVIzNlJXdEh3bnFTT2oyQUlyU05NcDhnVmM1NzM1enV5Mk5Yb3JRb3V1ekdjcE4wTnB6QU9FZ1gtRWFsUndLVHQteDNHQXpDdDdydzFRMjhwd1REcDRKY1F2d0RNZ1RSUFZ0OWhyRllXV1Z3LTQ0RXNBX090TzB6QVZwMnFJVzBzS0xCWHo1QndtR1JDMS1lQmQ3SG9uYzQ3UWUwMEJ6S2ZiY2ZvNGo5ZnNM0gG-AUFVX3lxTFBYN3RGR3d0bG1UcWRkcUYxcUxkd2NfWTNENV9jRTd2WHBjbzFHbDhWZUpPQkxPNlRSU3hiTUtVcGNyRlRBOU0zSWNqajYtVE5uRTU1bHMzVk9qUzJhLUdkSzVmZjExdXBBZmlZanpJOFhJT3JSb255VHBzR2s4VmJxRFFGZFNOVHdFbXlHb2NXVndSWFdYNTY0ZXpheWl2eWktMnJhcDZPRndFQS1KZENnRnAzUDJXZFZ3Y3ZCaXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PANAMA CITY, Fla.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;Eight deaths have been reported in Florida due to a "flesh-eating" &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/bacteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bacterial infection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;The Florida Department of Health has confirmed 13 total cases of Vibrio vulnificus across 11 counties, as reported by local outlets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;Last year, the state reported even higher numbers: 82 cases and 19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails" data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-js" data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt" data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-bacterial-outbreak-infects-dozens-city-neighborhood-officials-sound-alarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEADLY BACTERIAL OUTBREAK INFECTS DOZENS IN CITY NEIGHBORHOOD AS OFFICIALS SOUND ALARM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;Louisiana is also seeing a higher-than-average case count, with the health department reporting 17 infections and four deaths so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p data-v-7f0a623e&gt;The U.S. sees an average of 150 to 200 infections per year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
