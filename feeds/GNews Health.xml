It is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, and can be deadly even in small doses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/11/15/deas-third-annual-national-family-summit-fentanyl-highlights-progress" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that the potency of fentanyl pills agents have been seizing was decreasing, which may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As the drug supply has become more saturated with fentanyl, good drug supply may be becoming more stable, and people may be just developing a tolerance for fentanyl," Cerdá said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report found that West Virginia was the state with the highest rate at 81.9 deaths per 100,000 while Nebraska had the lowest rate at 9.0 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, between 2022 and 2023, rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in 20 states and did not change significantly in 25 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, over that same period, increases were seen in six states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cerdá said one hypothesis is that the increase in overdose death rates in western states may be due to shifts in the drug market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We saw that the penetration of fentanyl really started in the East Coast," she said. "Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said. "And we should invest resources and trying to figure out why the decrease is happening, and how can we learn, particularly from those states that are experiencing this decrease to proactively respond to those states which are currently experiencing an increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:19:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2d9IBowFBVV95cUxQYTNOLUpkTGhCVWlNNnhuZHc5eFZmYU5IaXdnNkd0blVNcGpDa001WEN1TFpveWs4U2hhVFR0UjhwMTV5UC1DbmszNUtwOFZUcWJPQ2JjaVhldTBFY2tFYkFNUGJaWVN0YkNfZVZ4UEU2X3djUjF4cTBURjh0bFd6cGNRdGI2X2pYN2JqaWVuRUMtYWJ5UE5OdXVtYlJmTjE0QUhN</guid></item><item><title>I tried micro-dosing Ozempic... what happened to my body shocked even doctors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQb2tBNGpRVVluZ0ZVVEJaMTlfZU9naURSYUREbHFJZEZvdmpmOEs1cmprdFI1bERvN1NiSno3RDQwUm1PQ3NFXzdnQzhoNllfTzVCYTd4dWp3aVRUQ1ZzS2g1TFFxc2I4WTNPcnRuTmNCTlZ3THFBNC1HaVF0amNXb29fel9fWVl4MzV6eTRjU1dKUUMxTkJ0Mm1vcVdwZVZqNElrY0RPZnprY0JGeHI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison Burgess had struggled with her weight for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 25-year-old hit roadblocks on the path to her goal of losing 50lbs, including a workout regimen that didn’t seem to be helping and a persistent sweet tooth that had her reaching for desserts more than she’d like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-741f30b0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; native, was considering bariatric surgery - a procedure that makes the stomach smaller and reduces how much a person can eat - in 2023 when Ozempic and similar drugs exploded in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March 2023, she signed up with Claya, an online weight loss treatment platform, and met virtually with a doctor who prescribed her Ozempic, the groundbreaking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-74163000-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug given off-label to help people &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-741879f0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injectable medication is given once every four weeks, and dosages start at 0.25 mg, typically increasing every four weeks, to be capped at 2 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess started at the lowest dose and saw immediate positive results. Inflammation in her body went down, her appetite was quelled, and she lost five pounds in the first week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later her doctor increased her dosage to 1.7mg, standard procedure when the patient is acclimating well and could benefit from a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Burgess began experiencing debilitating side effects, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;nausea and severe&lt;/a&gt; stomach pain. She was vomiting and had occasional diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess' goal was to lose 50 lbs with the help of Ozempic. Since starting it in 2023, she has lost 60lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized this is not okay. This is not how I wanted to lose weight,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when she and her doctor discussed microdosing the drug - or taking less than the 0.25 mg starter dose, which she had tolerated with no side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, Ms Burgess has lost 60 lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many people have personalized their treatment to microdose, but for Ms Burgess it was a life-changing hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dosages of Ozempic and similar drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, are meant to be increased very gradually, roughly every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katie Sorensen, a nurse practitioner specializing in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, who was not involved in Burgess’ treatment, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-microdosing-on-ozempic"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microdosing regimen has not been approved by the FDA, in part because ‘we would not be able to say for certain that a patient is reaping the full potential benefits of GLP-1 medications that have been shown in recent clinical trials,’ according to Ms Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If individuals experience weight loss with small doses, it could be because they are what scientists refer to as ‘super responders.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This term describes a specific group of people who achieve significant weight loss rapidly when taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have shown most people need to remain on semaglutide or a similar drug indefinitely in order to keep the weight off, it's not clear if those rules apply to a microdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But research into the drug's long-term effects is beginning to suggest that, regardless of dosage, a person must keep taking it because, while it suppresses appetite, it doesn't permanently alter the metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison did not disclose the dosage she is currently taking, but she has not experienced any adverse side effects in the two years she’s been microdosing Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her appetite is back, but the food noise has abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s been absolutely great.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess began microdosing Ozempic when a higher dose made her sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, dropping 18% of their weight over 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12 percent of their original body weight in the year after dropping the weekly shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeing those first five pounds melt away motivated Ms Burgess to get the most out of her medication. Determined not to let her weight loss stall after lowering her dose, she also prioritized eating more fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘You can’t think you can get on a GLP-1 medication and it’s going to completely change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just a tool. You need to create sustainable healthy habits to progress in the long run, especially if you eventually get off it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who stop taking the medications do regain some or all of the weight they lost and some people end up weighing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study last autumn found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - regained about two-thirds of the weight loss and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 12 percent of US adults report having ever used Ozempic or another similar medication for weight loss, while six percent indicated they were currently using the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 percent of people who had recently started medications like Ozempic discontinued use within two years, and 71 percent stopped within the first year, either because they had reached their goal weight or because the drugs were too expensive - with a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots have also been shown to raise the risk of life-altering and even deadly effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised concerns about popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic potentially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;leading to blindness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has connected these injections to conditions that trigger inflammation and restrict blood flow to the eye, resulting in severe and sometimes irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicines have also been shown to cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles don't function properly, leading to delayed emptying of food into the small intestine, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13813961/Ozempic-triggered-deadly-effect-forced-ORGAN-removed-robbed-basic-human-function.html"&gt;and ischemic colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where reduced blood flow to the colon causes inflammation and injury to the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year also revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13816987/deaths-linked-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-analysis.html"&gt;at least 160 people&lt;/a&gt; have died while taking Ozempic. None of the deaths are proven to have been directly caused by the injections, but experts say the reports indicate cases where they're suspected to have played a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:35:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQb2tBNGpRVVluZ0ZVVEJaMTlfZU9naURSYUREbHFJZEZvdmpmOEs1cmprdFI1bERvN1NiSno3RDQwUm1PQ3NFXzdnQzhoNllfTzVCYTd4dWp3aVRUQ1ZzS2g1TFFxc2I4WTNPcnRuTmNCTlZ3THFBNC1HaVF0amNXb29fel9fWVl4MzV6eTRjU1dKUUMxTkJ0Mm1vcVdwZVZqNElrY0RPZnprY0JGeHI4</guid></item><item><title>Dairy Workers May Have Passed Bird Flu to Pet Cats, C.D.C.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently reported new evidence from a study of a medical device placed inside the body, a spine-&lt;strong&gt;stimulating&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;implant&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with a muscle-destroying disease got a little stronger after using the implant. They were able to stand and walk more easily because of electrical stimulation to their spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco Capogrosso is an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburg, or Pitt, who led the research. "These people were definitely not expecting an improvement," he said. Capogrosso said, "They were getting better and better," over the study that lasted one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returning muscle function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implant was able to return some muscle &lt;strong&gt;function&lt;/strong&gt;, at least temporarily. The implant was already being tested to treat &lt;strong&gt;paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; in other patients. This new evidence suggests it might also aid diseases of the nervous system like spinal muscle atrophy, or SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMA is a genetic disease that slowly destroys motor &lt;strong&gt;neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscles. That leads muscles to waste away, especially in the legs, hips, and shoulders and sometimes those involved with breathing and swallowing. There is no cure. A gene therapy can save the lives of very young children with a severe form of the disease, and there are some medicines to slow the disease in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulating the spinal cord with low levels of electricity has long been used to treat chronic, or long-term, pain. Capogrosso's team also has tested it to help people paralyzed by &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt; or spinal cord injury move their arms and legs with assistance. The system sends electrical signals to nerves that have stopped reacting. This has the effect of activating the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso wondered if that same technology might help patients with SMA by stimulating sensory nerves to signal damaged muscle cells causing them to move. The researchers at the University of Pittsburgh published their study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They implanted electrodes over the lower spinal cord of the three adults with SMA. Using the device did not return normal movement but with a few hours of spinal stimulation a week, all soon experienced improvements in muscle strength and function, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"You never get better"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven-year-old Doug McCullough took part in the study. "With a progressive disease you never get any better," he said, adding, “So having any improvement is just a really &lt;strong&gt;surreal&lt;/strong&gt; and very exciting &lt;strong&gt;benefit&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three subjects increased how far they could walk in six minutes by the study's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said they could walk farther because they got less tired and “even a person this many years into the disease can improve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the improvements did not disappear as soon as the stimulator was turned off. But they did decrease a few months after the study ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Susan Harkema led similar studies of stimulation for spinal cord injuries while at the University of Louisville. She warned that the new study is small and did not last very long but said it was an important test of the device. She said it should be tested next with other muscle-&lt;strong&gt;degenerating&lt;/strong&gt; diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said some small but longer studies are beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. wanted advertisements that promote the idea of “informed consent” in vaccine decision-making instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed. It is a cornerstone of health care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shifting the framing of advertising for vaccines that the CDC has long recommended — like flu shots — to more heavily focus on the risks of vaccines could undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated, or to have their children immunized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Informed consent is always a must,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he suggested generating materials that focus heavily on possible risks without putting them in the context of proven benefits could badly hurt vaccination rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision to pull flu shot advertising is an early sign of how RFK Jr. may shift the U.S. approach to vaccinations as the nation’s top health official. Others came Thursday as well: The CDC’s influential vaccine advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;postponed a meeting scheduled for next week&lt;/a&gt;, and Politico reported that RFK Jr. may remove some members of that committee and other influential public health bodies, claiming they have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;STAT asked HHS whether the CDC had been instructed to cease promotional campaigns for several vaccines, including the Wild to Mild flu vaccine campaign, and whether the HHS secretary wanted replacements that focus on informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an emailed response, an official did not answer the second question, and denied that the CDC had been told to take down its flu vaccination campaign website — which was not the question asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage,” said an HHS spokesperson. “Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;informational pages&lt;/a&gt; on the benefits of flu shots still remain. The materials that sources told STAT they were instructed to take down were for paid promotions on other websites. Versions of those promotions were previously visible on some CDC webpages but are no longer up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu,” one of the remaining pages states. “Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor’s visits each year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, uptake rates for a number of vaccines have declined. About 23% of adults have received an updated Covid-19 shot. And though this flu season has been protracted, about 45% of people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have received a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this season — down about five percentage points from flu shot uptake in the pre-Covid era.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-hhs-secretary-pick-rfk-jr-financial-disclosures-biotech-investments-book-advances/"&gt;generated substantial income &lt;/a&gt;from challenging the safety of vaccines — through paid speeches, books, his former position as founder and chair of Children’s Health Defense, and as a lawyer suing vaccine manufacturers — refused repeatedly during his Senate confirmation hearings to distance himself from disproven claims about the safety of vaccines, such as the claim that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;vaccines are behind rising autism rates&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he said during the hearing that he is not opposed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though several senators expressed concern about Kennedy’s positions on vaccines, only former Senate leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a survivor of polio, voted against Kennedy’s confirmation on the Republican side of the chamber.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) expressed serious concerns about Kennedy during the hearings on his nomination. Cassidy is a physician who strongly supports vaccination. But in the end he voted for Kennedy after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;assurances&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy would work within the current system and not undermine vaccination efforts in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promotional campaigns the CDC was ordered to stop involved modest outlays of money, one source told STAT. They included paid ads in digital publications or promoted posts on social media platforms, the individual said. NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the “Wild to Mild” campaign was halted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ads featured images of fierce and less threatening animals — one juxtaposed a teddy bear against a grizzly — to convey the message that even if flu vaccines do not always prevent infection, people who receive them are less likely to become seriously ill and to need hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu can be wild. But a flu vaccine can shield both you and your cub from flu’s more serious symptoms,” said one of the ads, aimed at pregnant people. “Ask your health care provider about a flu shot during your pregnancy to protect your baby after birth — when they’re too young to be vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other iterations of the campaign were aimed at parents, adults with chronic conditions, people over the age of 65, and health care professionals.&lt;br&gt;In the materials viewable on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250131145821/https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/toolkit/social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a now scrubbed webpage&lt;/a&gt; there was no discussion about risks from flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are few side effects from flu vaccination, and those that are reported — things like injection site reactions, headaches and fatigue — are short-lived. In some, though not all, years, flu vaccination appears to be linked to a slightly higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/guillain-barre.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a form of progressive and generally temporary paralysis. In the seasons when an increase of GBS has been seen it is at a rate of about one or two additional cases per one million doses of flu vaccine administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being infected with the flu is known to increase the risk of developing GBS as well. Ensuring that people are aware of the risks of vaccines before receiving them is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;one of the six parts of a vaccine safety plan&lt;/a&gt; that RFK Jr. published in 2023. Already, people receive printed information with the risks of vaccines before they or their children are immunized, and advertising for specific vaccines is required to disclose side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — will not meet for its regularly scheduled February meeting, a senior HHS official confirmed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was to meet from Feb. 26 to 28, its first gathering since the Trump administration took office. That will not happen, Andrew Nixon, the HHS director of communications, told STAT in an email. Later on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a notice&lt;/a&gt; of the postponement was posted on the ACIP’s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon did not directly answer STAT’s query of when the meeting would be held instead, saying only that it is “upcoming.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, whose first day at HHS was Tuesday, has denounced the ACIP in the past. During his &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/29/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-analysis-kennedy-diagnoses-problems-but-fails-with-remedies/"&gt;Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;, he told the Finance Committee that 97% of ACIP members had conflicts of interest — a claim that people familiar with the rigorous vetting process ACIP members undergo have refuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CDC staff that organizes the committee’s work has for weeks been trying to get final approval from HHS to hold the meeting, without success. Until last week, the subcommittees or work groups that do the preparatory work for meetings of the full committee had been barred from meeting due to the c&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;ommunications “pause” the administration placed on federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt; soon after President Trump’s inauguration. The subcommittee meetings were allowed to resume last week, multiple sources told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For a time, the CDC thought the ACIP meeting could take place, and in person on the agency’s campus, though plans were recently made to shift it to an online session as the secretariat waited for final approval to convene the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The meeting — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt; for which has been online since early January — was to be held to discuss multiple vaccine issues, and to vote on recommendations for the use of a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;newly approved vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease; a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/02/18/fda-hhs-trump-zoetis-vaccines-gsk-sanofi-novo-insulin-rna-africa-roche-moderna-uk-michigan/"&gt;new meningitis vaccine from GSK&lt;/a&gt;, to be marketed as Penmenvy; as well as new recommendations on influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All advisory committee meetings where votes will take place must have a period for public comment. Members of the public can submit written comments, or ask to enter a lottery to be allowed to make a verbal comment during the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But because HHS would not formally authorize the meeting to proceed, the portal through which public comments would be submitted was not opened. Sources said that this was the final trigger for the decision of the CDC’s ACIP secretariat to ask to postpone the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon said in his brief email that the meeting would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have been concerned about the future of this committee, which for years has helped the CDC decide how to use approved vaccines most effectively. Vaccines that are recommended by the ACIP must be covered by health insurance, if the CDC director signs off on its recommendations. CDC directors have rarely rejected those recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen groups of medical professionals and issue advocacy groups, including the American Medical Association, the Gerontological Society of America, and a range of individual medical professionals and public health experts wrote &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to Kennedy and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez urging them to promptly reschedule the meeting. The campaign is being spearheaded by the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco who follows the work of the ACIP closely, called the postponement “problematic in several ways,” noting that there were important votes set to be held.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reiss also said the move “raises suspicions that Mr. Kennedy will not keep his word to Senator [Bill] Cassidy that he will not interfere with ACIP recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a supporter of vaccines, was clearly hesitant to support Kennedy because of his controversial opinions about the safety of vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-confirmation-hearing/"&gt;Kennedy refused to walk back during his Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy agreed to support Kennedy, however, after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;a list of assurances&lt;/a&gt;, including that Kennedy would “work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems, and uphold the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee recommendations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts expressed concern that this postponement is a harbinger of the possible dissolution of the committee — at least in its present form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that Project 2025, a set of policy recommendations that was led by the conservative Heritage Foundation and that is seen by some as a playbook for Trump’s second term, states that CDC officials should not be allowed to make recommendations regarding vaccination requirements for school entry; those decisions should be left to parents and medical providers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s what this is. This is step 1 of trying to eliminate CDC as a group that makes [vaccine] recommendations,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ACIP plays several roles. It sometimes advises on which vaccines can be administered together safely. At other times the committee explores signals of risk to vaccine recipients to see whether use recommendations ought to be altered. Concerns about the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a form of temporary paralysis, following receipt of two of the RSV vaccines for older adults led the committee to recommend &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/cdc-rsv-acip-hearing/"&gt;much more restrictive use&lt;/a&gt; of the products than manufacturers would have liked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fears about the committee’s future were only amplified when Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday titled “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.” One section of the order instructs aides to review existing federal advisory committees — ACIP is one — and report within 30 days on which should be terminated “on [the] grounds that they are unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A CDC source told STAT that the agency was asked Wednesday to provide written justification for the existence of several federal advisory committees that operate under its aegis. There are roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;20 federal advisory committees&lt;/a&gt; that advise the CDC on topics ranging from the incidence of breast cancer in young women to injury prevention and mine safety. Members of these committees &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/apply-for-membership/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are not paid employees&lt;/a&gt;, but receive travel expenses and, at least in the case of the ACIP, may be offered a $250 honorarium for the days on which they attend ACIP meetings, when they are designated as “special government employees.” Members are not paid for the time they spend on the work groups that do the bulk of the committee’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has terminated a successful flu vaccination campaign educating the public on the efficacy and benefits of flu vaccines, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" aria-label="NPR"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign, which uses infographics by depicting wild animals next to more tame animals, seeks to promote awareness on how immunization can help protect individuals from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" aria-label="webpage"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now been archived, although some information on the flu vaccination campaign can still be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" aria-label="online"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html"&gt;online&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The HHS had allegedly reviewed the campaign and decided it would not continue, as reported in NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the campaign is to inform the general public that vaccines still provide the best protection against the common flu. Although vaccines do not necessarily prevent the flu and individuals can certainly get the flu even after vaccination, the rate of complications like infection of the lung are significantly diminished, and symptoms from flu for those vaccinated tend to be much milder when compared to those who get the flu and are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of this important campaign could not come at a more inopportune time. Flu cases are the highest they have been in the last decade, with at least 29 million flu illnesses this season, 370,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message also remains indispensable given the current Texas measles outbreak, with 58 reported cases. Although the majority of cases have been reported in those unvaccinated, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" aria-label="four individuals"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;four individuals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; claim that they have received the measles vaccine. The flu vaccination campaign would help educate people on a common question- why are people who are vaccinated getting measles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timely infographic demonstrates that immunization does not necessarily prevent individuals from getting the infection, but rather provides protection and makes symptoms more tame or mild. This critical information is necessary so the public understands the efficacy of vaccines and why vaccinated patients can still get infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminating the campaign also comes at a time when thousands of probationary workers in the most influential federal health care sectors have been laid off, including personnel at the HHS, NIH and CDC. As I explained recently in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" target="_self" aria-label="Forbes"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these public health experts are critical in protecting and safeguarding health for Americans and individuals all around the world. These workers have been instrumental in carrying out groundbreaking research that have helped discover cures and vaccines. They have been indispensable in containing deadly infectious diseases, in developing key tests that help us identify various diseases and help communicate important public health information so all of us can stay safe and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It has been only one month into the Trump presidency, and science and public health have been under constant fire. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" target="_self" aria-label="Foreign aid"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/"&gt;Foreign aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help fight important diseases like Malaria, TB and HIV has been curtailed. Trump’s Secretary for Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed by the Senate, a well-known vaccine skeptic that has repeatedly spread misinformation that vaccines cause autism. And now, vital public health information is being taken down from websites, threatening the public’s ability to understand public health and make important informed decisions about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 represents a time of enormous public health challenges, from threats of the bird flu, to the common flu surging to outbreaks of Measles and Ebola being reported across the globe. This is not a time for putting the brakes on public health. If anything, the Trump administration should be putting their foot on the accelerator to ensure there is adequate staff to address all these public health issues. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that there must be transparency and a wealth of important information accessible to everyone so people can make decisions to protect themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing healthcare personnel and purging public health websites will do nobody any good.&lt;/p&gt;

The fourth wave, which is kind of unofficial, but we all refer to it, is fentanyl plus a stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The increase in cocaine deaths is totally driven by co-use with fentanyl. The increase without fentanyl, it appears, would have remained level.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rounding out the top ten states with the most cocaine overdose deaths was Maine, Connecticut, Ohio, New Jersey, and Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine had an overdose rate of 17.6. Connecticut followed closely with a rate of 16.8. Ohio, another key state, recorded an overdose rate of 15.1. New Jersey's rate was slightly higher at 12.5, and Michigan came in at 11.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The states showing the starkest increases in cocaine overdose deaths – Texas (+75.0 percent), Virginia (+61.4 percent), Alaska (+41.4 percent), Ohio (+36.4 percent) – have large swathes of rural regions where access to drug treatment resources can be scarce and education about the dangers of drug use more limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Border states like Texas may also see an influx of illicit street drugs that more inland states do not do to their proximity to the cartels pushing these drugs across the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akshaya Bhagavathula, an epidemiologist at North Dakota State University, told DailyMail.com: 'Recent toxicology data from overdose deaths shows an increasing presence of multiple substances, suggesting that "cocaine deaths" are often more complex than single-substance overdoses.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cocaine, unlike heroin and fentanyl, is a stimulant that induces feelings of intense euphoria and alertness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cocaine overdose deaths have fluctuated since the 1980s, peaking in 2006 at 2.5 deaths per 100,000, before dropping to 1.3 in 2010. Starting in 2015, deaths surged, mainly due to the combination of cocaine and fentanyl, while deaths solely from cocaine have remained stable. Data came from the CDC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects the brain’s reward center, which is dominated by the neurotransmitter dopamine, which motivates people to seek pleasurable experiences even if they prove fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An overdose causes a sharp increase in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and seizures. The primary cause of death during a cocaine overdose is stroke or cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since its heyday in the 1980s, the rate of cocaine overdose deaths nationwide has varied widely over the years. In 2003, there were 1.8 deaths per 100,000 people. This rose to 2.5 in 2006, then fell to 1.3 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But around 2015, the year in which Dr Palamar and his colleagues say the fourth wave of the drug crisis kicked off, cocaine deaths rose precipitously. The vast majority of deaths, when autopsy results were further analyzed, were driven by cocaine and fentanyl together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of cocaine deaths&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;alone, meanwhile, have remained relatively stagnant in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while much of the nation’s illicit cocaine supply has been contaminated with fentanyl, and many people overdose without having known their cocaine was laced, that is not to say that people are not willingly and knowingly using cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brian Townsend, retired Supervisory Special Agent with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told DailyMail.com: ‘What we are witnessing with cocaine aligns with a broader stimulant crisis that has been building in parallel with increasing prescription stimulant use.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past decade, prescriptions for stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5285333/Dramatic-increase-women-taking-ADHD-pills.html" class=""&gt;have surged&lt;/a&gt; by 58 percent since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: ‘Many people now recognize the dangers of opioids, but there is far less caution around stimulants. Cocaine, as a widely available illicit stimulant, is filling that gap.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Palamar, who specializes in following trends in co-use studying people who survive their overdoses, said collecting more complete data about what led to the overdose and what the person thought they were taking is problematic because ‘and I know sounds common sense, but you can't interview dead people.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When someone passes away, the only thing you can look at is toxicology, which can tell you what substances they had in their system,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Just because it's in somebody's blood sample, it doesn't mean that they used it, that was a cause of death. Did the cocaine contribute? The cocaine could have actually helped reverse the fentanyl a little bit.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:32:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNb3l2MTB3aDFmOXllS2IwdHB5dnc4SzZEX0xydEVWeHB0YnREX1YyTGJ2SGg1NG9MZTdrSnNhMnJEczNtaW9jdXZubGpuQlJZOEVZai1BbkVZelNQeG95Y1BPNXlCWC04YmtSWTZCWHhHanhENnFCUFM2VVEyWFdnem8zQ1dEMW5NY2dlbksxNHlMNGI0VVhkOVBBcnAwVFVR0gGmAUFVX3lxTE10Sm9ZUi1xZmJraDNGVGdncFJOY3p3a3dDYzdVVmJFQ2NLazZCX3RQeGh5MHFhemdRVEhyS2l6a0JXSl8tQlA4NmNNeUhGUXM1U3huVWt1ZzJGZXNVRlN1Zm1NZTFya3FKTk5uUFVrU2htR2tpLWNPTWRuX2U0c3Vmak9MQ0FiYktjbXYycWZKTGk2c3ZYN255NW5NbHZjN2FtQkVvbWc</guid></item><item><title>Parasite lurking in woman's brain caused mysterious 'burning' leg sensation - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxOd2pkM0R6bjR1R0tSc1VmVHZOMng1aW5JVmNXV2phdElOOUVnaHIwZGtjTXBoYWwtWGJOY1Y4SXpTcTZIX0MtbWplcTBuMHg1LUJPQUE4WGxIWlJnbWY1Z2NsdFNNOFZtMlJMWXc2eW8yamJncExyN01kdUl6S1pHUlpCTko1WmhWVzJRS3lPX2NJRlhDUVRDM1I5N3NmMzhEaGFjMUd1dlctcEQtV1JCS0xEMTNDbU8tMFFyM1JTaW9VSnpDd1JhWC1vb0JYX1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A painful burning sensation in a woman's legs turned out to be the result of a parasite burrowing into her brain, her doctors have revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old, from New England, likely contracted the parasite while travelling in Hawaii, according to a case report published Feb. 13 in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms began with a strange burning sensation in her feet. Over the coming days, the pain spread up her legs, and the impacted areas became sensitive to even the lightest touch. She was also fatigued, but she initially attributed that to jet lag following a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to an emergency department about the sensations in her legs, but her exams came back normal and she was ultimately discharged. Days later, the sensations spread to her truck and arms and she developed a headache. So she went to a second emergency department, and again, her exams were "reportedly normal," although her immune-cell count was up. She received medications that relieved her headache before being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 scary parasitic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about a week of these symptoms, the woman developed confusion and her partner brought her to hospital once again. Her blood tests and kidney function were still normal, and microscopic examination of her blood showed no obvious signs of parasites. However, one thing that did stand out was an elevated level of a type of white blood cell called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; these cells help the body fight off foreign invaders, including parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team then performed a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to draw out a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds the spinal cord and brain. This test also revealed a very high level of eosinophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her results were consistent with a condition known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophilic meningitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a rare form of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord often caused by parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the case report, the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis is rat lungworm (&lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis), &lt;/em&gt;a parasite that lives in many tropical and subtropical regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ruling out other culprits, the team determined &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; was behind the woman's case. While the parasite was not detected in the patient's blood, further testing of her cerebrospinal fluid revealed genetic traces of the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adult form of the parasite primarily lives inside rodents. Their larvae then pass out through the rodent's feces, at which point they are eaten by slugs and snails. These larvae mature inside the mollusks until their host is eventually eaten by a rat or other rodent, and the life cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a human eats an infected mollusk that's raw or undercooked, or a raw vegetable that has been contaminated with their slime, they can also become infected. Shellfish, including land crabs and freshwater prawns, may also become contaminated if they eat an infected slug or snail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all people who ingest &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; experience symptoms, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, in some cases the larvae migrate to the host's central nervous system and reach the brain — in some lab animals, this can happen within four hours of ingestion, the case report notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the human brain, the parasite can trigger headaches, a stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, tingling or burning sensations and eventually, seizures and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; infections resolve on their own as the parasites die off, even in cases of meningitis, the CDC says. In those cases, supportive treatments might include painkillers and antiinflammatories. That said, these infections can sometimes be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the woman's case, the patient was given a 14-day course of antiparasitic medication, together with a steroid drug to help bring down inflammation in her nervous system. She was discharged from hospital after six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent infection with rat lungworms like &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; , the CDC recommends that people not eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs, shrimp or prawns. They should wear gloves and wash hands after handling snails or slugs in the garden.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48000"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48001"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48002"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPTExxTFI5RVA0MVJjcExqbHJsa0Eyc21WLXBhOUVJVFdyazVoajdHUHU4Q3V3enA5ZktMN2pHYndSOEVMcE4tZ2FBRG9yRXhIbVdoYXl0cXVuSWRlU0xDMmxBUDdybldrTUYycXFFOHg4NFN2M1NGX1JDZktDeXFUUy0tNHVzeEpYUUFVTDB2VmNRZlRkNHc</guid></item><item><title>A CDC vaccine committee meeting, the first of Kennedy's tenure at HHS, gets postponed - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORTBXS01rRmwzZlNzbXBZMU5qYnZnd0Z0TjVtYmFBRlBJZ0F4a0lMS0JxRUt2aG5FOFBuc1VvYUFIUTNNcFVOUHZ5V2YtTk8zTWdGdG1IWTNfd253MFVlbmtjTkJwX0Y4cGx4Q0VwcWFUbW44SDJCVndFT0hZZUFlREl2UkN4Ri1KX3ExTzVzV1dzUTlGV2paWjEtUC1iQjRBdnlfU1pqd3TSAVZBVV95cUxQZ1BiMFJENndmanJBMkZCRFlnR1pkcE5xSzU5N3gzdWx0RUlUM0RQSzRTRDhDanlocExfelV1X25hR1pYaWtKZXF1b0RxUWEzclNrX3FmZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for next week — the first since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The group of independent experts convenes three times a year on behalf of the CDC to weigh the pros and cons of newly approved or updated vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for HHS, said next week’s meeting was postponed to “accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The ACIP workgroups met as scheduled this month and will present at the upcoming ACIP meeting,” Nixon wrote. He didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether the agency had scheduled a new date for the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There were concerns among public health experts that the vaccine advisory committee could be delayed or postponed given Kennedy’s past criticism of the committee and of vaccinations, particularly childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of early Thursday afternoon, the agenda for the meeting was still available on the agency’s website. The discussion included a presentation and vote on the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Identification of First Case and Public Health Notification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the index cat (cat 1A, one of three cats in household 1), aged 5 years, exclusively indoor, spayed female domestic shorthair, experienced decreased appetite, lack of grooming, disorientation, and lethargy, followed by progressive neurologic deterioration. On the second day of illness, the cat was evaluated at a local veterinary clinic; on the fourth day, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center (VMC), a tertiary care facility with advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities where, because of rapid disease progression, cat 1A was euthanized. Because the cat’s owner had known occupational exposure to dairy cattle, and because highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus was known to be circulating in dairy cattle on Michigan dairy farms, upon approval from the state veterinarian, cat 1A’s remains were submitted to MSU’s veterinary diagnostic laboratory (VDL) for necropsy. Brain and nasal swabs tested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were positive for influenza A(H5) virus.* Genetic sequencing results identified HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the sequencing results; the virus was indistinguishable from viruses circulating in Michigan dairy cattle&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). This identification of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in a domestic house cat resulted in initiation of a public health investigation by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MDHHS/MMDHD). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 1A lived in a household with two adults, one of whom worked on a dairy farm in a county known to have HPAI A(H5N1)–positive dairy cattle; two adolescents (adolescents 1A and 1B); and two other exclusively indoor cats (cats 1B and 1C) (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Cat 1B was reported to have signs of watery, purulent eye discharge, increased respirations, and decreased appetite 4 days after onset of illness in cat 1A. MSU VMC requested that the owner obtain a swab from cat 1B because the cat was too ill to be taken into the clinic, but specimens were not submitted by the owner. Cat 1B’s illness signs were reported to have resolved 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. Cat 1C had no signs of illness when it arrived at MSU VMC and received negative test results for influenza A 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. No other indoor or outdoor pets were reported. All four household members had daily contact with all three cats in the home. Although the dairy farm where the adult household member worked was not known to be affected by HPAI A(H5N1) virus, it was located near other affected farms.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; This dairy farmworker did not work directly with animals but worked on the dairy farm premises. The worker reported removing work clothes and boots outside when returning to the household; these items were then brought to a location in the home that was not accessible to the cats. The cats and household members did not consume unpasteurized milk or milk products.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical examination of cat 1A by veterinary staff members was notable for signs of severe neurologic disease (obtundation, abnormality of cranial nerves, and abnormal motor function in all four limbs), anorexia, and lethargy. The cat initially had signs of ataxia, decreased appetite, swollen right jaw, abnormal gait, and hiding behavior. Some improvement and return of appetite occurred on day 3, 1 day after the cat received subcutaneous antibiotics. However, on day 4, it could not hold up its head, had an unsteady gait, and displayed all initial signs again; the cat was euthanized on day 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from three household 1 members (the non farmworker adult and the two adolescents) 11 days after onset of illness in cat 1A; specimens were sent to MDHHS, where they tested negative for influenza A viruses by RT-PCR. The dairy farmworker declined influenza testing. Only one of the three persons tested (adolescent 1A, who had no comorbidities) experienced signs or symptoms of illness (cough, sore throat, headache, and myalgia), which began 6 days after illness onset in cat 1A). The household 1 members who received testing received a 10-day course of twice-daily oral oseltamivir as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) at the time of testing; the dairy farmworker declined testing and PEP.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; Adolescent 1B reported a “dry croupy” cough 6 days after onset of illness in cat 1A that was attributed to severe allergies. Communication with public health representatives ended before final resolution of adolescent 1B’s symptoms was reported. Only adolescent 1A received any positive laboratory test result; this test was for rhinovirus/enterovirus on a multiplex PCR BioFire Film Array Respiratory Panel at MDHHS. Cat 1A’s owner, the dairy farmworker, had regular contact with cat 1A and adolescent 1A; the farmworker reported 1 day of vomiting and diarrhea that preceded onset of illness in cat 1A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days after referral of cat 1A to MSU VMC, cat 2A, an exclusively indoor intact male Maine Coon cat aged 6 months from a second household (household 2), was brought by its owner directly to MSU VMC with a 1-day history of progressive neurologic deterioration, anorexia, lethargy, and facial swelling. On initial physical examination of cat 2A, it was found to be obtunded, with abnormalities of cranial nerve function, abnormal motor function, puffiness of the eyes and nose, and minimal movement; the cat died within 24 hours of onset of illness signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 2A lived with one additional indoor cat (cat 2B) and its owner, a dairy farmworker. Nasal swabs from cat 2A tested by RT-PCR at MSU VDL, 1 day after onset of cat 2A’s illness signs and upon initial examination, were positive for influenza A viruses and were confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 at the United States Department of Agriculture’s NVSL. Cat 2B did not show any signs of illness, and nasal swabs tested negative for influenza A viruses. Cat 2A’s owner transported unpasteurized milk from various farms in a Michigan county that included farms with dairy cattle confirmed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and lived in the same county where cat 1A’s owner lived. Cat 2A’s owner did not wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling raw milk; reported frequent milk splash exposures to the face, eyes, and clothing; and did not remove work clothing before entering the home when returning from work. Cat 2A’s owner reported that cat 2A would roll in the owner’s work clothes, whereas cat 2B did not exhibit this behavior. Cat 2A’s owner experienced eye irritation that began 2 days before the onset of illness signs in cat 2A but reported no other symptoms. The owner did not receive testing for influenza and declined oseltamivir and further contact with public health officials, stating fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Screening and Testing of Veterinary Staff Members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary staff members who handled the infected cats at the local veterinary practice or MSU VMC were contacted and enrolled by public health authorities for 10 days of symptom monitoring after their last exposure to the cats. Overall, 24 veterinary staff members, including one veterinarian, five nurses, three technicians, five assistants, two caregivers, three interns, and five students, were potentially exposed to the two ill cats; 18 (75%) were contacted and monitored, but because of their limited exposure, they were not offered PEP.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; PPE protocols are in place for all patients managed in MSU VMC’s isolation unit, where the cats were treated and in laboratory units where specimens were tested. For HPAI A(H5N1), recommended PPE include a Tyvek suit, boot covers, nitrile gloves, a surgical head cover, and a face mask. Veterinary staff members were reported to likely wear surgical masks for the initial encounter of cat 1A and N95 masks thereafter. Varying levels of PPE use were reported by veterinary staff members, which ranged from only using gloves to following full protocol. Laboratory staff members wear either powered air-purifying respirators or N95 respirators. Among seven persons who reported signs or symptoms after exposure to the ill cats, including four who reported nasal congestion and three who reported headache, five agreed to testing; all received negative influenza A RT-PCR test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected. Normally, the spike protein stays in the body for only a few days after vaccination, but in some PVS cases, it was still present more than 700 days later. This lingering spike protein has also been linked to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point. We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” Iwasaki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz further added that PVS might be similar to other infections that lead to chronic symptoms, each through different biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation. We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shakira's Health Crisis: Fans Rally Outside Hospital Following Her Statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that a deeper understanding of PVS is required to make better &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/does-the-estimate-of-154-million-lives-saved-by-vaccines-since-1974-stack-up/" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with fewer side effects. “For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce PVS symptoms,” Iwasaki adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Yes, it’s possible to get an STI without having sex — here’s how - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQdlY1Zk41UkhOZ1BQdF9jSF95QlVfODFTZWZ4VGhyM0ttcGpXQXFoQ01OMXpvS1ZNUTY3QkVjenR1R01xcFhOa1hRZkZDd05EbDBnUEl6aE9XTThYeXN3eko4M0RoRjhlOGRfQ3IyRXoxRGVRTlZpejViLXZRNW5iamRoX1pOU1lheFpvdmd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;While sex is built into the very definition of an STI, experts caution that it is possible to contract one without getting it on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/default.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20more%20than%202.5,from%20all%20STI%20prevention%20partners." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, STI rates are on the rise, putting millions of people’s lives at risk from entirely preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sexually transmitted infections — which affect 1 in 5 Americans — are most commonly found on the genitals, anus and mouth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fizkes – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“STIs must be a public health priority,” the CDC warned. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency noted that “the most alarming concerns” revolve around syphilis cases — which are at the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/lifestyle/syphilis-cases-soar-to-highest-level-in-70-years-cdc-sounds-alarm/"&gt;highest level they’ve been in more than seven decades.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Distressingly, syphilis is among the number of STIs you can contract without having intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s possible to get an STI without having penetrative sex. Herpes, syphilis and HPV can all be passed via skin-to-skin contact with an infected area of the body,” &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/contributor/olivia-cassano"&gt;Olivia Cassano&lt;/a&gt; of Evvy, a company that offers vaginal health services, including at-home microbiome tests, clinical care and coaching, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Skin-to-skin transmissions also include sharing bodily fluids through actions like mutual masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano noted that in addition to skin-to-skin contact, STIs can be transmitted via oral sex. Specifically, both gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the throat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both infections can also infect the eyes, which contain mucous membranes that STIs can easily invade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria from gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the eyes through direct contact with semen or vaginal discharge from an infected person — or a person rubs their eyes after touching infected genital areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another STI eye infection is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/health/cluster-of-sexually-transmitted-eye-syphilis-cases-point-to-one-man-cdc/"&gt;ocular syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, which develops when the Treponema&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pallidum bacterium enters the body, usually through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Penetrative sex isn’t the only way to catch an STI, so it’s best to inform yourself and be prepared before any kind of sexual contact,” warned Cassano.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when sharing razors, needles and sex toys. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Roman – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She urged the orally active to use dental dams as a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when using or sharing razors, needles and sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/blog/can-you-get-an-std-without-having-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Evvy&lt;/a&gt;, “Infections like HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C can also be spread through sharing needles or other equipment that comes into contact with infected blood, like during intravenous drug use or through unsterilized tattoo needles.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Cassano explained that STIs can be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She stressed the importance of consistent condom use for sexually active people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;STI cases are on the rise in the US.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Saiful52 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to further guard against contracting or spreading an STI? “Have open communication with sexual partners and get regular STI screenings!” she urged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.universaldrugstore.com/health-news/sexual-health-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Universal Drugstore&lt;/a&gt;‘s “Sexual Health Index,” certain states are hotspots for STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi, for one, was ranked as the “worst affected” by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/health/weird-place-you-can-get-an-sti-that-everyone-can-see-revealed/"&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt;, with one of the highest chlamydia rates in the nation of 700 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIV is most prevalent in Georgia, with 23.1 cases per 100,000 residents, a figure that is more than double the national average. On the other hand, Minnesota has the fewest HIV cases, with only 4.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

One person wrote: “My baby didn’t breathe for the first 5 full min, if I had a home birth she would not be here with us today.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actor’s delivery reflects a larger trend toward alternative birth practices, including home birth, which has risen 60% over the past seven years. Interest in alternative births has also been tied to mistrust in the mainstream U.S. healthcare system due to factors like an increase in c-sections, disproportionate rates of non-white maternal deaths in hospitals, and implicit bias in medical care. As alternative practices increase in popularity, doctors are concerned about the influence of social media posts that don’t always tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s important to share information and give evidence to show that this is not all rainbows and sunshine,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/dawn-nolt-md-mph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dawn Nolt" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/dawn-nolt-md-mph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Dawn Nolt&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and author of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/2/e2021055554/184545/Risks-of-Infectious-Diseases-in-Newborns-Exposed?autologincheck=redirected" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pediatrics report" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/2/e2021055554/184545/Risks-of-Infectious-Diseases-in-Newborns-Exposed?autologincheck=redirected" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;pediatrics report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on alternative perinatal practices. “There are risks to some of these things.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many alternative birth practices have not been studied comprehensively.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends leaving the tub after early labor and delivering “on land.” It can be difficult to move sometimes, and labor can progress faster than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s uncomfortable to move, and that could be why many birth parents stay in the water [through delivery],” Nolt said. “There’s also this idea that the transition for the baby from inside the uterus … out into the real world still buffeted by water might be appealing, but there’s no evidence showing that it decreases any sort of trauma to the baby.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACOG has &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2016/11/immersion-in-water-during-labor-and-delivery" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="reported" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2016/11/immersion-in-water-during-labor-and-delivery" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that water birth cases are showing significant risks to the baby in the second stage of labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are literature reports of babies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/legionnaires-disease-linked-to-water-births_n_59419d98e4b003d5948cf4c7" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="getting infected" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="59419d98e4b003d5948cf4c7" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;getting infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or taking their first breaths [under] the water and having complications,” Dennis said. “So when a patient is looking at wanting to actually push in the water, there are really important things that they should look for. One is to make sure they are delivering with a provider who is really experienced in water birth.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The provider must understand how to minimize the chances of infection, prevent umbilical cord “snapping,” and avoid water aspiration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients should also verify how the tub will be cleaned and other critical safety points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important for a patient to ask, ‘How will you be monitoring me in the water? How will you be checking my vital signs and the baby’s heartbeat?’” Dennis said. “You also need to be aware of the emergency plan. Let’s say you’re pushing, and there are signs of complications. What’s the next step? How will they get you out of the water, and where will they bring you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Malte Mueller via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Malte Mueller via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Not all water births is freebirth, and vice versa.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freebirth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A famous water birth took place in 2022 in the ocean and was also a freebirth.

There’s also triple the risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Midwives have been around for centuries for a reason,” Rankins said. “Having someone present who understands birth and can address potential problems is lifesaving.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rankins noted that having a midwife attend to a home birth is essential. She partners with midwives in her community to provide a safe place for transfer to the hospital when needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis shared that she has personally witnessed devastating outcomes from freebirths and is concerned that social media has glamorized the trend, causing some people to forgo medical resources that they could have otherwise accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I understand and appreciate that there is mistrust in medicine … but there are ways to have an unmedicated, natural experience while still having medical support to ensure a safer and better outcome for you and the baby,” Dennis said. “If someone is considering a freebirth, I would encourage them to really ask themselves why and explore deeply what they are trying to gain … and see if there are ways that it can be accomplished by still being supported by someone who is licensed to practice medicine.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lotus Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like freebirth, lotus birth appeals to those who seek natural experiences. A lotus birth involves leaving the baby attached to the umbilical cord and placenta until they fall off, which can take as few as &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="five days and up to 15 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;five days and up to 15 days&lt;/a&gt;. The placenta is typically covered with salt and herbs to minimize odor and is carried close to the baby in a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have not taken a position on lotus birth, and the practice has not been fully studied. However, the AAP released Nolt’s report in its journal, Pediatrics&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to help physicians understand the practice and treat patients who may have been involved in a lotus birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our research, the impetus for lotus birth … is the idea that there is a spiritual connection of the placenta to the baby and that there needs to be a nonviolent separation of those two entities,” Nolt said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spiritual connection is hard to prove or disprove, and Nolt said that medical professionals are expected to follow proven practices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We as physicians try to think more about what science there is and risk/benefit to the baby,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report found no evidence-based benefit to babies with lotus birth. Risks include infection from the dead tissue, tearing of the umbilical cord and jaundice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proponents of lotus birth have noted the advantages of extra blood flowing from the placenta to the baby, but the same outcome can be achieved by delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, a standard practice when there is no distress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis For Morning Sickness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis has been used to ease nausea for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thousands of years" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;thousands of years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so&lt;span&gt; it’s not entirely surprising that people have tried it to treat morning sickness — but physicians warn against it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite this, a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; examined 90,000 umbilical cords sampled from 2019-2023 and found that 20% tested positive for cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum and was so miserable that I probably would have tried almost anything to feel better, but I’ll tell you, that would not have included marijuana,” Dennis said. “That’s because there is no demonstrated safe level of marijuana in pregnancy.” Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare form of morning sickness that causes persistent vomiting that can lead to dehydration and other medical issues. It is typically treated with anti-nausea prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dennis pointed out that it would be unethical to clinically test cannabis use during pregnancy, but collected case reports have demonstrated the outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found historically, and continue to find now, that there are higher numbers of people who have early pregnancy exposure to marijuana, that there is no safe level,” Dennis said. “It does increase the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including smaller birth weight. Depending on how much someone is using and how long they are using throughout pregnancy, there can be withdrawal in newborns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use during pregnancy has also been tied to abnormal brain development and other &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;, but more research is needed.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;American doctors, who tracked over 37 million people, said the injections put users at higher risk of nonarteritic ischemic anterior optic neuropathy (NAION) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The condition, known as an 'eye stroke', occurs when the vessels supplying blood to the optic nerve become blocked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, they &lt;span&gt;said while the exact cause was unclear, the rapid drop in blood sugar caused by the drug could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;damage blood vessels in the eyes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is because the sudden change in pressure can cause fluid to leak out of delicate blood vessels in the retina, leading to swelling and damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around half a million people in the UK and some 15million in the US are now thought to be using the jabs, which can help them lose up to 20 per cent of their bodyweight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, found of the 37 million adults, there were 166,932 patients on type 2 diabetes drugs, including semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.6555?guestAccessKey=9cc7cefb-e963-490d-bbd1-8ad419a0b542&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=022025"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said: 'We observed an increased NAION risk with semaglutide exposure relative to non-exposure.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also observed an 'increased risk' among those on semaglutide compared to 'users of non–GLP-1 drugs empagliflozin and sitagliptin,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They added: 'In the absence of a known mechanism for this association, we urge clinicians to weigh the concern for an increased risk of a rare but potentially blinding eye condition with the many therapeutic benefits of semaglutide.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are currently no treatments for NAION or an 'eye stroke', which affects around one in 10,000 people, and vision often does not improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other strokes caused by a loss of blood supply, there is no weakness, numbness or loss of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People typically suffer sudden vision loss in one eye, without any pain, and patients often notice the issue on waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a separate study &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2829326"&gt;published in the same medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month suggested that the drugs may trigger debilitating vision issues including NAION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;noted this was likely due&lt;/a&gt; to the fact the jabs rapidly lower blood sugar levels which could damage blood vessels in the eyes — not that the injections themselves were 'toxic'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report detailed the cases of nine adults, aged 57 on average, who took either  semaglutide or tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven were later diagnosed with NAION. But most noticed their vision improving within days or weeks of stopping the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the report, one &lt;span&gt;woman in her 50s developed NAION the day after her first semaglutide injection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She woke up the morning after the injection with 'painful vision loss' in her left eye. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed swelling in her optic nerve and damaged blood vessels in her retina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman stopped taking semaglutide and her insulin, with follow-up appointments confirming her vision returned to normal two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, t&lt;span&gt;wo weeks after restarting semaglutide to control her diabetes, the vision loss returned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was diagnosed with severe optic nerve swelling, and her vision returned to normal seven months later. &lt;/span&gt;It was unclear if she stopped semaglutide a second time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in Denmark, where Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is based, are also currently &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14205789/officials-ozempic-cause-blinding-eye-disease-Denmark-EU.html"&gt;investigating the links between semaglutide and vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like any medication, the jabs are known to cause side effects that vary in both frequency and severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other reported problems include constipation, fatigue, stomach pain, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bizarre symptoms, such as hair loss, have also been reported among some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have also long told how they are treating increasing numbers of slim women who end up in hospital after falsely telling online chemists they are overweight to pass eligibility checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, advertising officials issued a warning to advertisers, businesses and influencers to remove online and social media ads for weight-loss prescription-only medicines targeted at members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This followed a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14083761/social-media-influencers-thousands-prescription-Mounjaro-jabs.html"&gt;MailOnline investigation&lt;/a&gt; that found social media influencers were being encouraged to illegally promote prescription weight-loss jabs to their thousands of&lt;span&gt; followers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:11:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Women have a higher risk for long covid.

Women between the ages of 40 and 54 who were not yet menopausal were at the highest risk and were 45 percent more likely to develop long covid than men of the same age&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UHKVSPGVARCHPJ7MVE3VQLMAAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, among women ages 40 to 54 who had already experienced menopause and women ages 18 to 39, there was no significant difference in long-covid risk compared to men in the same age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VZUMI3BRTJC7TCGGWXC6EJKDPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This suggests that hormones involved in menopause, fertility and pregnancy may play a role, and may be protective factors against long covid, said &lt;a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/shahdp"&gt;Dimpy Shah&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of population health sciences with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="7BRMH4RVIVF6HJZAM6TY3SXHRU" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="7BRMH4RVIVF6HJZAM6TY3SXHRU"&gt;Higher estrogen levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KSE77P2RAFGX7DW6MAXG2HDCOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels in women &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2717878/"&gt;tend to drop&lt;/a&gt;. Shah said. And while adult women under the age of 40 have high levels of estrogen, they also tend to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1583036/#:~:text=A%20consistent%20pattern%20of%20age,39%2Dyear%2Dold%20groups."&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of progesterone, a hormone that helps to balance and regulate estrogen in the body, she said. This is especially true if they are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558960/"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPC7OEJV4VAW3ARXJZVD2NERAA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both estrogen and testosterone interact with the immune system in ways that are not yet fully understood. But generally, experts said, higher levels of estrogen may be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4226184/#:~:text=Estrogens%20influence%20immune%20and%20inflammatory,pregnancy%2C%20and%20menopause%20%5B9%2C"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-020-01998-9"&gt;chronic&lt;/a&gt;, longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02279/full"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt;, which may help explain why women are &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722"&gt;almost twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; as men to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENWQGGVQMVC7FAKU7U7XF5CM6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah cautioned that further study is needed on the role of hormone levels in the development of long covid, though hormones may not completely explain the long covid risk among some women. It probably is a combined effect of age, pregnancy and menopause, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKIQUYGFVHW7NTLJWTT2G3AHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that women ages 55 and older — who would be menopausal — had a 34 percent higher risk of developing long covid than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OX2VC3UIYNHOLIBLHRUSCWRRII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah also said that other factors, such as preexisting differences between men and women in their rate of having autoimmune diseases and other comorbidities, could be playing a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2N2PEXVHFHXRG4YP674UNZBB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/akiko-iwasaki/"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the findings suggest that hormones play a key role in long covid, and hormone-replacement treatments may be beneficial for long-covid patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63CUQUIWJNF6TERO565GTRVSEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anecdotally, she said some of her long-covid patients have seen their symptoms improve while taking low-dose testosterone treatments. In women, testosterone helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from being overactive, she explained, so testosterone therapy could be helping to reduce their inflammation and autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NL7PEYAO45FZRN7OB75YQYGBNI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NL7PEYAO45FZRN7OB75YQYGBNI"&gt;Different symptoms among men and women&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAMFGJE57VENXBHM5NNIRFGY7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The RECOVER study also noted that men and women with long covid experienced different types of symptoms, which, Iwasaki said, mirrored the results of &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.24303568v1.full"&gt;her own research&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that in some cases, long covid in men and women may actually be different yet related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSYNTE47B5CWRFUUWBZ6Q76FAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When I first saw the study, I thought, ‘Wow, a lot of the differences they’re seeing are exactly what we see in our work,’” she said. “This is revealing more subsets of long covid that may be triggered by different causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5PMRO5J6X5ARPNSF4UPHMFG7GA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her research suggests that men with long covid are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction, whereas women are more likely to experience hair loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry eyes, and a loss of smell and taste.

Her &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.18.599612v1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that while women who developed long covid tended to have a normal-looking immune system response to kill the coronavirus, they then experienced increased inflammation, even after the virus is gone — compared with women who recovered, who were able to resolve this inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QCKM44AQ7ZHMHEY64TO5ALHSXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Women with long covid also had increased levels of a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/"&gt;gene that is associated with autoimmune disease, called Xist&lt;/a&gt;, compared with women who did not develop long covid, Blish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5KQ6G3JZQ5BCLMJ67K4DMQ6L24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In contrast, Blish said, men with long covid appear to have a harder time killing off the coronavirus in the first place, which suggests that their symptoms may be a result of a more persistent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENIDNKUKQ5EHBPKPUPWG3JH3KI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both of these immune system responses need to be studied further, she said, but these results suggest that the prevention and treatment of long covid in men and women could vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WOD4LQ5UARFZHO3O3RMZFGERKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even if they end up in the same place, the underlying drivers of disease can be quite different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRMPTGEU2RH3JBDPXMZ2V7RRIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One limitation of the RECOVER study is that it did not include data about participants’ hormone levels, menstrual cycles, pregnancies or use of hormone-related medications such as birth control.

Pictured Brian Johnson, better known as the Liver King, who has built a following from his raw carnivore diet, mainly filled with meat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One particularity harrowing case saw a man on carnivore diet suffer cholesterol levels so high that it started to leak out of his hands &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis revealed he had an increased risk of all three types of major kidney stones, those formed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid, and these were now at 'levels consistent with stone growth'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics said they eventually convinced him to ditch the carnivore diet. He was also given medication to help with gout, a type of arthritis and the condition he was attempting to treat with the extreme eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the medics reported their patient remained kidney stone free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case they said it highlighted the potential risks a carnivore diet posed for kidney stone formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This patient’s urine studies demonstrate the potential hazards of the carnivore diet,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to increased animal protein, the exclusion of dairy products, and the removal of fruits and vegetables, the diet creates an optimal environment for the development of all stone types.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The advent of social media and the use of such communication for health information will make fad diets a continually growing issue.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics said a wealth of evidence showed eating too much meat contributed to kidney stones by increasing levels of uric acid in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'acidic environment' helps the waste products to crystallise, they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Interest in the diet has been partly fuelled by advocates like Joe Rogan (pictured) and Jordan Peterson saying it improved their mental and physical abilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They added that recent studies suggested a fibre rich diet, which includes carbohydrates avoided by carnivores, helped feed bacteria in the guts that could hinder the formation of kidney stones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kidney stones are considered a relatively common ailment, affecting about in 10 people in the UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are more likely to develop in men than women and are typically diagnosed in patients between the age of 30 and 60.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many kidney stones are passed through urine without patients noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they do cause pain, they are usually easily treated via either medication or a number of different procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

STONES? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney stones are hard lumps that form due to a build up of waste products in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are usually found in the kidney or the ureter — the tube that connects the kidneys to your bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can be extremely painful and can lead to kidney infections or the kidney not working properly if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A tenth of Britons and Americans suffer kidney stones, with 30 to 60-year-olds most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is more likely to happen if a person doesn't drink enough fluids, takes certain medication or has an underlying condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those in severe pain, with a high temperature or have blood in their urine should contact their GP or NHS 111 immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a kidney stone has formed, the body will tries to pass it through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most are small enough to do so and can be managed at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, larger stones may need to be broken up with surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to half of all sufferers will have kidney stones again within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

cause serious complications, dramatically increasing the risk of potentially deadly infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carnivore diets have grown in popularity in

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have also warned that those who limit their diet to meat could be at increased risk of conditions like scurvy and even cancer due to the diet's lack

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, where health often takes a backseat, mostly due to an unhealthy diet, we tend to compensate for it by popping dietary supplements. From multivitamins to calcium and fish oil, you can easily find OTC supplements in nearby stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, including 64% of women and 51% of men, according to the 2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A 2024 poll suggests that 75% of adults take supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; points out that drug-induced acute live failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. The herbal and dietary supplements contribute to roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean you should toss away your multivitamin stash and other dietary supplements? However, it is important to know what you are incorporating into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan noted last year that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red yeast rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black cohosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products. We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between the stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it’s basically a coin flip if that’s true or not,” senior author Dr. Robert Fontana, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We weren't aware that so many people were taking these supplements. So, when doctors see patients in the office, they don't necessarily ask about supplement use or take into consideration their effects," Likhitsup, who's also a transplant hepatologist adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies also suggested that toxic heavy metal contamination was found in some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-supplements-to-avoid-if-you-want-to-live-longer/articleshow/117403418.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the FDA regulates supplements, the federal agency does not review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness. The FDA regulates them as food, not drugs. So, it is up to the manufacturers to properly label their products, and then the FDA reviews after they hit the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to stop your nails from breaking often&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to stay safe is to communicate with your healthcare providers about the supplements you are taking. Also, don’t fall for ‘megadosing’ trends for speedy results. The Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption.

But it’s not all a figment of the imagination either — narcissists are also more likely to be excluded from groups due to their strong personality types. Over time, this exclusion can exacerbate narcissistic traits further, creating a “self-perpetuating cycle,”  researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YULDLDPXHZCZFMME62JJ25SIQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study sheds new light on how personality traits can impact everyday life, according to lead author &lt;a href="https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/personen/christiane-buettner/" target="_blank"&gt;Christiane Büttner, of the University of Basel in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people think of narcissism in terms of entitlement and arrogance, but our research highlights that narcissists also frequently experience social pain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5CQQJZOVREYZA4LCJLP5KVF5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner worked with a global team of researchers, which used large-scale surveys, sampling and controlled experiments on people based in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Germany, the United States, Britain, Switzerland and New Zealand. While the negative impacts of social exclusion are well documented, Büttner wanted to understand who was being excluded most often and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZCIQZ3SZNGSDHMYIGO6FHBZYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts regard narcissism as a continuous trait; however, the research team focused on those with higher narcissism scores and “grandiose narcissists” in particular. Büttner said she regards this as an “intriguing personality trait,” as it involves a desire to dominate social situations and a heightened sensitivity to social cues. It’s in contrast to vulnerable narcissism, which is more closely linked to insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLMXAYF5EBCGVFPAH24EQ6KEI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the biggest questions going into this research was whether narcissists might actually report less&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;ostracism because their grandiose self-image could shield them from perceiving negative treatment, or whether they would report more ostracism due to heightened sensitivity to social cues,” Büttner told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O62JWWM7AVAWPICGAX2O6RNIUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our findings strongly supported the latter: narcissists, particularly those high in the antagonistic, rivalry facet of narcissism, report being ostracized more frequently.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HR76XF3DBVALRECSJ3A2MWY7DY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However her team made a striking discovery, finding that “it’s not just a matter of perception — narcissists are actually excluded more often,” Büttner said. Results showed “ostracism and narcissistic traits reinforce each other over time,” she said, meaning that for those cast out of a group dynamic, it can become a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHHERF536BFOFMUTRLH2X3XICY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers used data from &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jbnst-2018-0022/html" target="_blank"&gt;Germany’s Socio-Economic Panel&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running survey of approximately 22,000 households, and homed in on 1,592 people with higher narcissism scores.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Narcissistic traits were assessed based on a short form of the &lt;a href="http://www.persoc.net/persoc/uploads/Toolbox/NARQ_English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between two subfacets — admiration and rivalry — with people grouped into personality types based on their responses to statements such as: “I deserve to be seen as a great personality”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and “Most people are somehow losers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NDTVDLJP5D53PSZTQDUN3ME2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Levels of ostracism were assessed based on responses to statements such as “Other people have ignored me” or “Other people have shut me out from conversations,”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;with participants asked to answer on a scale between 1 (meaning never) and 7 (always).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JUBU3BW56JA4NN3G3XYWVXM5VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers focused on whether people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had reported ostracism over a two-month period in 2015 and found that “individuals with higher levels of narcissism retrospectively report getting ostracized more frequently than individuals with lower levels of narcissism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QWMBBWTNLBHGBD2SBBQZBCQDOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They also carried out six follow-up experiments involving&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;more than 2,500 people in total. One of these included a virtual ball-throwing game where two other players either included or excluded the participant. The participant was then asked to report on how many throws they had received and whether they felt they had actively participated in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XX3NIGE2RNBXVA6EZ6M2GMZTQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another experiment involved hypothetical discussions where the participant was told someone “must have forgotten” that they attended a concert together, and asked if they felt they had been excluded. Taken together, researchers said they found people with higher narcissism scores were more likely to perceive ambiguous social interactions as deliberately exclusionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DQKXA7F42FALBOYKH257B2NJ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A final piece of the puzzle involved analyzing&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;14 years of data from a &lt;a href="https://osf.io/75snb/wiki/Publications/" target="_blank"&gt;national survey in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; of more than 72,000 people. It showed feelings of exclusion were followed by changes in narcissism levels a year later — and vice versa — demonstrating that “ostracism seems to solidify narcissistic traits over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N3CPQNQXYVHMDKVNRSYZGAURXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For Büttner, the most interesting takeaway was that not only do narcissists view themselves as victims of social exclusion, but their behavior actively contributes to it in a cycle that can “fuel the development of narcissistic traits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COI4VXBPMJCKRE27SSV6IKIJWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This means that narcissists who are excluded may become even more narcissistic in response, potentially increasing their likelihood of future exclusion,” she said. “That’s an important insight because it suggests that ostracism doesn’t just happen &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; narcissists, instead, it seems to be part of a self-perpetuating cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDDMA2US6VG7NEY2GY6W6JDB4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the research, said the findings back up previous findings that narcissists are “hypersensitive” to social exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UXAGE744YVB3RCHFQCJBCHCOOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that narcissists tend to be selfish and lack empathy for others, and that over time they become less well-liked and cause conflict in their relationships,” she told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JGYH5Z7RNZCYTCSXZ3HGCXQO6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The findings are in line with our previous research showing that narcissists can be paranoid that others mean them harm, even when there is no evidence for this. Our research suggests that this is due to narcissists’ constant need to defend their grandiose yet fragile sense of self — they are always on the lookout for ego-threat so they can deflect it quickly,” Hepper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CHE4ZXKWYNF6TPEZ7EIAIZKFUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner said one of the study’s main limitations was that while the team used&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;multiple methods like surveys, experiments and longitudinal data, most of the researchers’ findings relied on self-reported experience of ostracism. While experiments helped to bridge this gap, further observational research could be done to develop understanding, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I3TIFFKTARFDRBLOSELR5XLXWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another potential limitation to the new study’s findings was that narcissism was studied in healthy, student, community and representative samples, the research said, and severely narcissistic individuals may react differently.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Previous studies indicate that even small increases in narcissism have been shown to increase aggression, stop the forming of successful relationships and lead to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQLLUQSLBBCQJPFJSKQNSCMJ74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, Büttner said the findings could have implications for managing conflict in large groups, such as the workplace or on social media. How to disrupt such behavioral patterns or prevent them occurring in the first place are also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“important questions for future research,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LMHCQY23OVCP7HB4BB7DQE6UZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner noted that narcissism is “a risk factor for downstream mental health consequences of ostracism, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PC3MSDA4ANBBTM2ESHNFSOR37U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Addressing these dynamics in structured ways, whether in workplaces, therapy, or social interactions, could help reduce the negative consequences of exclusion for both narcissistic individuals and those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:08:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPS3JWYW1lb3V5Q3g3V1hzVHB2bVBCUGdMMzYyVExYbXZ1R1R4Q210MW9DUFIteUFkcDhlSldZMGhmMVI1Mlp4ZklUaW1xcXdQUzRUREZ4bWJCVUJ0QUFRRDFjc3UtamFJS0I5aV90RS1rSWhGN2pvSnpFamJtdjNZS19yX2xFMDZGbEpBMzNaNEt2RURZelBOb29TeWkzbDVE</guid></item><item><title>Narcissists are significantly more likely to feel excluded, new study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaTExYVR0ajM2a3owU0dEZENRX0J6a2phRFlBRG8wZjRfSFRTMnNYOG40MUthWVV0MmRaMDZpN1VSLUxTVUVmUmdaQ0d4WTRpNlBnM0FRaDJhLVp2aC1YSFpqXzliOUgzVWZGSHBPbXRaY25oc1AxTFVfWGVvTjhEdFhBVjhLNUh1c1NmUk9VWnZvZElHcWdFUmZDRdIBkgFBVV95cUxQSXVBS2NmV3Y3R25oRnZWcnM0QUVBTXlRZ2RHRU9MdXVuT1B3SUVHbDcxdnhWVTM3bUxSU0wwaDMzbTJjczBmVThvUlFJRFVLMVR0RWFpQ21OaEg4N2x1WTJOUWRnTDQtdDgtRGxhdWo4aEVpVkVvNTVGUjF6cDB6Sm5ZZ2hBd01EWEg3ODdnQjBVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            If you don’t personally &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/spot-narcissists-wellness/index.html"&gt;know a narcissist&lt;/a&gt;, you can likely think of a few celebrities or politicians who display entitlement, lack empathy and crave constant admiration.

            Grandiose narcissists, also known as overt narcissists, are particularly notorious for their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/health/narcissism-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;inflated sense of self-importance&lt;/a&gt; and relentless need for attention — traits that may match the description of someone you just thought of. Unlike covert narcissists, who mask their behavior with self-pity, grandiose narcissists rely on charm and manipulation to thrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Now, a new study has found&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;grandiose narcissists are not only more likely to feel ostracized but are also genuinely excluded more often than those with less egocentric personalities.

        How narcissism and exclusion fuel one another
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9bxck0000356mof0gb7ox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists often display disruptive behaviors in social settings, such as aggression or arrogance, that increase the likelihood of others distancing themselves over time. These self-absorbed individuals are also highly sensitive to social status and ambiguous cues, making them more likely to perceive exclusion even when it’s not happening, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000e356mlbqa4y4l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a very thin-skinned quality to narcissistic people, so if they even get a whiff that they are being left out, they’re going to be acutely aware of that,” said Los Angeles-based licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula, who treats people with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank"&gt;narcissistic personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; and has written several books on the topic, including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-You-Identifying-Narcissistic/dp/0593492625" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Not You&lt;/a&gt;: Identifying and Healing From Narcissistic People.” “It’s picking up a glance or not liking a social media post.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000f356mwsnqkg8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Durvasula, who was not involved in the research, noted these perceived slights are usually unintentional — someone may simply be too busy to engage with a post or look away without realizing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000g356mxhw8s2sr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when narcissists overreact to perceived acts of ostracism, friends, family members or colleagues may start avoiding them out of concern for their behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000h356mde911xn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To navigate relationships with narcissists, Durvasula recommends a strategy known as disengagement — intentionally withdrawing contact or interactions. Narcissists often interpret this behavior as exclusion, but it may be necessary for your mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000i356moxx4bw36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nevertheless, these actions create a destructive cycle identified in the study that explains how narcissism and ostracism fuel each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9lypf001p356mdetuiksi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists tend to view themselves as victims when they feel ostracized. This victim mentality intensifies their antagonistic behaviors, pushing people even further away, said Christiane Büttner, lead study author and social psychologist at Switzerland’s University of Basel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000j356mck6cmvv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This suggests that ostracism doesn’t just affect narcissists in the moment — it might shape their personality development in ways that perpetuate future exclusion,” Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000k356mkh4w5iae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study examined individuals who scored high on narcissism tests, it did not specifically focus on those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6710132/" target="_blank"&gt;pathological narcissism&lt;/a&gt;, Durvasula noted. She said she believes the effects of narcissism and exclusion would be even more extreme in individuals with clinical narcissistic personality disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000l356muwxfgy08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also found that individuals who exhibit narcissistic rivalry, viewing others as competition and acting more aggressively, are more likely to be ostracized than those with high levels of narcissistic admiration, who seek attention and status in socially engaging ways rather than isolating themselves, Büttner said. This pattern is particularly common in workplace dynamics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000m356m3ln8mn6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s actually a natural social perceptiveness narcissistic people have, which is why they can be quite successful in leadership and business,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000n356mmgpxvc8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, narcissists typically only use this skill when it benefits them and blame others in most situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9grj5000c356motpl0agu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissistic behaviors need to be addressed early on. This proactive approach is challenging because schools can attempt to enforce anti-bullying policies to counteract such behavior, but outside of the classroom, social exclusion is harder to control, Durvasula said, pointing to the example of a child not being invited to a birthday party.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0s000u356m5trmxaxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that anti-bullying practices should be just as much about anti-ostracism behaviors to look out for the kid who may not be fitting in with peers as well and monitoring the situation,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000v356mmvpu7le3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If children don’t receive therapy for narcissistic traits, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to change as they enter adulthood, and narcissistic tendencies may intensify over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000w356myb6jxg66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To improve, narcissists need consistent intervention through therapy. Therapists must also be mindful of developmental traumas, childhood environment, attachment issues and any other psychological factors that may have shaped their narcissistic personality, according to Durvasula.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000x356msl6x7tw6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually the (final straw) that gets a narcissistic person to therapy is either sadness or anxiety, but they will still often pin it to something happening outside of them,” Durvasula said. “My boss is never fair to me, I can’t get promoted, I don’t have enough money, my spouse is mean to me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000y356my8abaeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Social skills training or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; could help narcissists challenge assumptions that people are excluding them, while doing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts could help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to prevent future ostracism, Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9hi300010356macx4wbqt@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="handling-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Handling a relationship with a narcissist
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hdod000s356mfjkxp01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study primarily examined examples of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/health/energy-vampire-in-person-work-wellness/index.html"&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;, but Durvasula said dealing with a narcissist in a family or friend circle is often more challenging due to the deeper emotional history involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0015356m6a5jympj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether you’re navigating a work or personal relationship with a narcissist, Durvasula suggests empathic disengagement or yellow rocking, a strategy of remaining pleasant and polite in their presence without overperforming or sacrificing your mental well-being to satisfy them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0017356m8bq2klzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists in work and personal relationships create challenges for others who have to manage their disruptive behaviors and pick up more responsibilities because they can’t rely on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0018356m90xr3qgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In work settings, this might look like a narcissist colleague not pulling their weight in a team of five. Other team members may hesitate to confront this person for fear of the reaction, ultimately picking up their share of the work instead, Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0019356mbqfx8vb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family members face similar challenges, often creating backup plans to avoid last-minute chaos, as they can’t rely on a narcissist to follow through on commitments, such as picking someone up from the airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l001a356m5e9ht9w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when to disengage fully, Durvasula said it’s a personal decision. Some people may need to cut ties after just a few negative experiences, while family members might tolerate behavior for years or even decades from some narcissists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

As mentioned, there has been some research on animals that seems to suggest it's possible. One study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bioRxiv" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2023 that found that a certain cocktail of proteins helped elderly mice live twice as long as their counterparts who didn’t get the cocktail.

But given how essential these steps can be in protecting your cell health, they’re worth considering if you don't already have them in rotation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="20" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep a night&lt;/strong&gt;. “This helps us recharge and restore several cellular functions,” Dr. Fudyma says. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that restful sleep is also potentially helpful for reducing the risk of dementia.” FYI, this is a *minimum* amount. Everyone needs different amounts of sleep, but the general rule of thumb is that you should aim for between&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" seven to nine hours per night" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, quality over quantity! And establishing regular sleep patterns (consistent bedtime and wake-up times) is also important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Follow a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="plant-forward diet" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;plant-forward diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn't mean you can't eat animal products. But you might consider following a Mediterranean-style diet (making sure to get plenty of fish), Dr. Mandelbaum says. Dr. Fudyma also recommends doing your best to limit &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ultra-processed foods" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, along with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red meat" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to maintain a healthy weight&lt;/strong&gt;. Being overweight or having obesity can be hard on your body in multiple ways, and that stress will ultimately increase your biological age, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Get in 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical activity is good for your brain" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity is good for your brain&lt;/a&gt; and your body, Mandelbaum points out. “When you exercise, you improve your brain function through Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),” he says. Working out regularly can also lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, boost your memory, and lower your risk of depression—all of which can support a better biological age, he says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Cut back on alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;. “There’s &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more and more evidence" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;more and more evidence&lt;/a&gt; coming out that links alcohol consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cancers" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="poor overall health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;poor overall health&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Fudyma says. If you do drink alcohol, he recommends scaling back a little or even considering cutting it out entirely. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;/strong&gt;. “Smoking is definitely something that leads to biological aging,” Dr. Fudyma says. “It’s incredibly beneficial for the aging process to stop.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Slather on sunscreen&lt;/strong&gt;. Skin cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="most common" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; type of cancer in the US, making it really important to protect your skin. Dr. Tallia recommends using sunscreen regularly and doing your best to avoid spending too much time in the sun to lower your risk. This will keep your skin cells fresh and healthy (plus, fewer wrinkles!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Stay on top of your oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;. Chronic inflammation from poor oral hygiene can contribute to the aging process, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has even linked bad oral health to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to tamp down on stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Some level of stress is inevitable in life, but Dr. Fudyma says that doing what you can to dial it down by meditating or slowing down in general can be helpful. Emotional stress puts physical stress on your body and cells, which can increase your biological age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-can-you-really-reverse-your-age" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much can you really reverse your age?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There’s no hard and fast answer to how many years you can clip off your biological age, and doctors are hesitant to pinpoint an exact range.

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a growing number of scientific studies have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease isn't just a disease, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;it's an infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene? (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-gray-long-sleeve-shirt-holding-black-tablet-computer-v_2FRXEba94"&gt;Jonathan Borba/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that low levels of gingipains were evident even in people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's could be a smoking gun – suggesting they might have developed the condition if they had lived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our identification of gingipain antigens in the brains of individuals with AD and also with AD pathology but no diagnosis of dementia argues that brain infection with &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; is not a result of poor dental care following the onset of dementia or a consequence of late-stage disease, but is an early event that can explain the pathology found in middle-aged individuals before cognitive decline," the authors explained &lt;a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333"&gt;in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a compound formulated by the company called COR388, showed in experiments with mice that it could reduce bacterial load of an established &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; brain infection, while also reducing amyloid-beta production and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have to wait and see what future research will uncover about this link, but the research community is cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Drugs targeting the bacteria's toxic proteins have so far only shown benefit in mice, yet with no new dementia treatments in over 15 years it's important that we test as many approaches as possible to tackle diseases like Alzheimer's," chief scientific officer David Reynolds from Alzheimer's Research commented in a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/bacteria-behind-gum-disease-linked-to-alzheimers/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story was published in January 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers developed a neural network model showing that people fine-tune their attention based on past experiences with distractions. Unlike traditional models that study one task with a single distraction, this study tested multiple simultaneous distractions, simulating real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people primarily adjust by suppressing previously distracting inputs rather than enhancing focus on a task. This research provides a new understanding of how attention works and could have applications in cognitive training and ADHD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Suppression:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain learns to ignore distractions rather than focusing harder on a task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike previous models, this study tested multiple distractions at once, mimicking real-life situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; Upcoming MRI studies aim to identify specific brain regions involved in adaptive attention control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine watching a speaker and another person nearby is loudly crunching from a bag of chips. To deal with this, a person could adjust their attention to downplay those crunch noises or focus their hearing on the speaker. But understanding how human brains do this has been a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with a new neural network model, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have a better tool to uncover what brain mechanisms are at play when people need to focus amid many distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107902"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that people focus not by concentrating extra hard on a subject, but by ignoring inputs that were distracting in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous work showed that when people encounter a very difficult task, they adjust their attention to make them impervious to new distraction,” said study author Wouter Kool, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at WashU. “However, it remained unclear how they adjusted their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not that people may not do both forms of attention control — concentrate and reduce distractions — but how they do that can be affected by the difficulty of previous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our work, previous difficulty also clearly affected their sensitivity to current difficulty,” Kool said, summarizing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this older work is the Stroop task, which includes a list of words for colors that can match or not match the color in which the word is printed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating the delay in reaction time when participants are asked to name the color of mismatching words, researchers have created simple neural network models to understand how humans focus on tasks. But again, that’s one distraction, one task. Kool’s postdoctoral researcher Davide Gheza wanted to change it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We increased the sources of distraction, mimicking a cocktail party or a conference meeting,” Gheza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Stroop task that involves simple colored words, their task requires to choose among two complex stimuli with varying shapes, colors, borders and motion directions. This is meant to bring four total sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running participants through a series of trials where each of the four sources could be either the target task or one of the distractions, “we found strong evidence that people were really modulating their attention to the distractor and not so much to the target,” Kool said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People tune their attention very specifically,” he said. “If something or someone was distracting before, you learn to ignore them in the future, but you stay open to other inputs that might help complete the task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing this model on brain data collected while participants perform this task in an MRI scanner. Gheza and Kool believe this will help them pin down what specifically is happening in people’s brains while they encounter and overcome multiple sources of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was financially supported by a Multi-University Research Initiative grant (ONR/DoD N00014-23-1-2792) to Kool and by a McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience grant to Gheza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this attention and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c607f646d6a6a697e4c7b797f786022696879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-02088-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/a&gt;” by Wouter Kool et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behaviour requires humans to constantly manage and switch between multiple, independent and conflicting sources of information. Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we developed a multidimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use this task to test whether people adapt to previous conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control and their neurocomputational underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:58:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9sTGtONkdPZHNlZzlIcEZhaW8wN19aRnBuYkdoUnRGU2s0WjdTWDBwWGU0WWtFSldzamV4QlRGY29wU0hJSDQweXJNZVhDZkMtQXQxRzE1cHBJOUtfM09OMVdyQ1ZSS0pRc1R1SXY2czdqdmwyVjFtX0JR</guid></item><item><title>In Texas, vaccine-choice activists are ascendant - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxObjU2U1hIT0NZbG5tbHRELUU2UmhMbl9JT0NtUVBrN2FOQnhvZUVQcW1MM3d0R2FwSVhtZGg4d1Bkb2dlU2lvcXFfZ2l1cU1DeE9HMGVyY2FxM0c3U0xOeEthdktYeDI3WjRQc2x2amhmUkYxTzZ5cmhISzdQbXI1VDdESFNVdGNCYlQ1ZzMzN2xzQU1FNUd1SXIyQU1sa2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-80cr42 e1lrptjp2"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;n the oil&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;towns&lt;/small&gt; of west Texas a measles outbreak is spreading.

As well as being used in sweet foods and drinks, they are found in many savory products, such as ready meals, ketchups and sauces, and even bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly used is aspartame, also known by its brand names, which include Nutrasweet®, Equal®, and Sugar Twin®. It is 200 times sweeter than sugar so, although it contains calories, much less is needed to give the same level of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10822749/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that artificial sweeteners may have adverse health effects, particularly if consumed often. They have been associated with several health conditions, including affecting the functioning of the gastrointestinal system, causing headaches and taste alteration, and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-071204" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (CVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study investigating the effect of aspartame in mice has provided further evidence that it may contribute to CVD risk, and outlines how it might do this. The study found that aspartame triggered spikes in release of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; — the hormone that controls blood glucose — leading to the build up of fatty plaques, or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atherosclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125000063?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence linking aspartame consumption to increased risk of atherosclerosis through an insulin-mediated inflammatory pathway.

They also assessed the health of their blood vessels at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insulin spikes after consuming aspartame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 30 minutes of consuming aspartame, the mice’s insulin levels increased significantly. The researchers noted that this was not surprising, given that there are sweetness-detecting receptors lining the mouths, intestines, and other tissues of both mice and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These receptors help guide insulin release after sugar is eaten. Aspartame, being 200 times sweeter than sugar, seemed to trick the receptors into triggering much higher insulin release.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not only directly after aspartame consumption that insulin levels were raised. Mice on the aspartame diet had persistently high insulin levels, suggesting that long-term consumption of this artificial sweetener may lead to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research adds to growing concerns about the metabolic effects of artificial sweeteners.

The data indicate that aspartame triggers insulin spikes via parasympathetic activation, leading to chronic hyperinsulinemia. This, in turn, upregulates CX3CL1, an immune signal that attracts inflammatory cells, exacerbating arterial plaque formation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 4 weeks of the aspartame diet, the mice started to develop atherosclerotic plaques in their arteries, which increased by the 8 and 12-week point. In mice fed sucrose, the plaques did not develop until the 12-week point, although these mice did gain weight and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/people/yihai-cao" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yihai Cao;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yihai Cao&lt;/a&gt;, who studies chronic diseases related to blood vessel disorders at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that the discovery of CX3CL1 was unexpected, but might help the development of more effective drugs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because [CX3CL1] is transmembrane protein, it will be locked on the endothelial cells lining in the inner layer of blood vessels. In this way, it can trap moving inflammatory cells in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi explained why replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners might not decrease risk of metabolic disorders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This mechanism could explain why diet soda drinkers, despite avoiding sugar, still show a heightened risk for metabolic diseases. Chronic insulin elevation is a well-known risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and the inflammatory response triggered by CX3CL1 may contribute to long-term cardiovascular damage.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limiting aspartame intake may benefit health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073617" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that he and his team plan to verify their findings in people.

These neurons, located in the ventral striatum, separately process better-than-expected and worse-than-expected outcomes. In experiments with mice, silencing these neurons altered their anticipation of rewards, affecting their decision-making behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that the brain tracks a full range of possible rewards, rather than just an average, which aligns with machine-learning models of decision-making. If confirmed in humans, the findings could explain difficulties in assessing risks seen in conditions like depression and addiction. Future research will explore how uncertainty influences this brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Neural Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; One group processes better-than-expected outcomes, while another tracks worse-than-expected ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision-Making Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain represents a full spectrum of possible rewards, not just averages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Clinical Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could help explain impaired risk assessment in conditions like depression and addiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, big and small. Any of these decisions — from the least consequential such as picking a restaurant to the more important such as pursuing a different career or moving to a new city — may result in better or worse outcomes.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the brain gauge risk and reward in making these calls? The answer to this question continues to puzzle scientists, but a new study carried out by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University offers intriguing clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107898"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision.

Together, the experiments showed, these cells allow the brain to gauge the full range of possible rewards associated with a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that mice — and by extension, other mammals — seem to be representing more fine-grained details about risk and reward than we thought before,” said co-senior author Jan Drugowitsch, associate professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in humans, the findings could provide a framework for understanding how the human brain makes reward-based decisions and what happens to the ability to judge risk and reward when reward circuitry fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning illuminates reward-based decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have long been interested in how the brain uses past experiences to make new decisions. However, according to Drugowitsch, many traditional theories about such decision-making fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch uses the example of selecting a restaurant: If you’re in the mood to play it safe, you might choose a restaurant with a menu that experience tells you is reliably good, and if you feel like taking a risk, you might opt for a restaurant that you know offers a mix of exceptional and subpar dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the restaurants differ considerably in their range of offerings, yet existing neuroscience theories consider them equivalent when averaged, and thus predict an equal likelihood of choosing either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that this is not how humans and animals act — we can decide between seeking risks and playing it safe,” Drugowitsch said. “We have a sense of more than just average expected rewards associated with our choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine-learning researchers developed a theory of decision-making that better captures the full range of potential rewards linked to a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They incorporated this theory into a new machine-learning algorithm that outperformed alternative algorithms in Atari video games and a range of other tasks in which each decision has multiple possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They basically asked what happens if rather than just learning average rewards for certain actions, the algorithm learns the whole distribution, and they found it improved performance significantly,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;paper, Naoshige Uchida, professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, and colleagues reanalyzed existing data to explore whether this machine-learning theory applied to neuroscience, in the context of decision-making in rodent brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that in mice, activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine — which plays a role in reward-seeking, pleasure, and motivation — corresponded to reward-learning signals predicted by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Drugowitsch said, the work suggested that the new algorithm was better at explaining dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How mouse brains represent a range of rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Drugowitsch teamed up with co-senior author Uchida to take the research a step further. Together, they designed mouse experiments to see how this process plays out in a brain region called the ventral striatum, which stores information about possible rewards associated with a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine activity only provides the learning signal for expected rewards, but we wanted to find representations of these learned rewards directly in the brain,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained mice to associate different odors with rewards of varying magnitudes — in essence, teaching mice the range of possible outcomes of a choice. They then presented the mice with odors, and observed licking behavior (mice lick more in anticipation of better rewards) while recording neural activity in the ventral striatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified two distinct groups of neurons in the brain: One that helps a mouse learn about better-than-expected outcomes and another tied to worse-than-expected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of this as having an optimist and a pessimist in your brain, both giving you advice on what to do next,” Drugowitsch explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers silenced the “optimistic” neurons, the mouse exhibited behavior suggesting that it anticipated a less appealing reward. Conversely, when the researchers silenced the “pessimistic” neurons, the mouse behaved as if it expected a higher value treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see many future directions for their work, including how the brain makes decisions when there is more uncertainty about what each initial option represents and how their findings apply to more general reasoning about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch noted that more research is needed to confirm the results in humans and to adapt the findings to the complexity of human decision-making. However, based on the parallels between mouse and human brains, he believes the work may already shed some light on how humans assess risk in decisions and why people with certain conditions such as depression or addiction may struggle with such assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship, funding, disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors on the paper include Adam Lowet, Qiao Zheng, Melissa Meng, and Sara Matias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01NS116753; F31NS124095), the Human Frontier Science Program (LT000801/2018), the Harvard Brain Science Initiative, and the Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this decision-making and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5135343f3f38220e3f34303d3e3f11393c227f393023273023357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dennis Nealon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dennis Nealon – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08488-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Drugowitsch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:35:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5LMEFBbFNmNEU2M2tGNkJtQVRsaDN2RFQ4eHB2QVFmQXhTMVZlSnZud2FhZ19wVU95QndRdndTQkwzOGVfZ1lraG5jSzlsdWx2czNpSlNPRkxaUHBnUWJsRkJKZ1B1SVFFVWpxTWRKcU0xX1U1NzJsSXdR</guid></item><item><title>Why Is This Indonesian Volcano Spewing Blue Lava Instead of Red?

&lt;p&gt;In the eastern reaches of &lt;strong&gt;Java, Indonesia&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Kawah Ijen&lt;/strong&gt; volcano stuns the world with a spectacle of &lt;strong&gt;neon-blue flames&lt;/strong&gt; lighting up its crater at night. While it appears as if the volcano is spewing &lt;strong&gt;blue lava&lt;/strong&gt;, the truth is even more fascinating. This rare phenomenon, combined with one of the &lt;strong&gt;most acidic lakes on Earth&lt;/strong&gt; and a grueling sulfur mining industry, makes Kawah Ijen one of the most extraordinary and perilous volcanic sites on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind the Blue Flames&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the mesmerizing sight, the &lt;strong&gt;blue glow&lt;/strong&gt; seen at Kawah Ijen is not actual lava, reports &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-does-indonesian-volcano-burn-bright-blue-180949576/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smithsonianmag&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it results from the &lt;strong&gt;combustion of sulfuric gases&lt;/strong&gt;. When sulfur-rich gases escape from the volcano’s cracks at temperatures reaching &lt;strong&gt;600°C (1,112°F)&lt;/strong&gt;, they ignite upon contact with oxygen, producing vibrant &lt;strong&gt;blue flames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;molten sulfur&lt;/strong&gt; continues to burn as it flows down the slopes, creating the illusion of glowing&lt;strong&gt; blue rivers&lt;/strong&gt;. This spectacle is only visible at night since daylight overpowers the &lt;strong&gt;luminescent effect&lt;/strong&gt;. While other volcanoes worldwide also release sulfuric gases, Kawah Ijen’s chemical composition and gas concentrations make this phenomenon particularly intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The World’s Most Acidic Crater Lake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the summit of Kawah Ijen lies a surreal &lt;strong&gt;turquoise crater lake&lt;/strong&gt;, which holds the title of the largest acidic lake on Earth. Its extreme acidity is due to &lt;strong&gt;high levels&lt;/strong&gt; of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, giving it a pH as low as &lt;strong&gt;0.13 in its center&lt;/strong&gt;—so acidic that it can dissolve metals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lake isn’t just a scientific &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/nasa-curiosity-rover-captures-clouds-mars/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79093" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;curiosity&lt;/a&gt;; it’s also a source of environmental concern. The &lt;strong&gt;Banyupahit River&lt;/strong&gt;, which originates from the lake, carries its acidic waters downstream, affecting aquatic life and vegetation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its stunning appearance, the lake is &lt;strong&gt;extremely dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;, and prolonged exposure to its acidic fumes can cause &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/8-signs-your-mental-health-is-declining/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75990" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Harsh Reality of Sulfur Mining&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its natural beauty, Kawah Ijen is a working volcano, where hundreds of &lt;strong&gt;sulfur miners&lt;/strong&gt; risk their lives daily. The volcano’s fumeroles release thick clouds of &lt;strong&gt;toxic gases&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners use&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/danger-in-the-pipes-drinking-water-map-reveals-states-worst-hit-by-lead-contamination/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73589" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; simple pipes&lt;/a&gt; to channel and condense the sulfur, allowing it to solidify into bright yellow blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These workers then break the sulfur by hand and carry loads of up to &lt;strong&gt;90 kilograms (200 lbs)&lt;/strong&gt; down the steep crater—sometimes multiple times per day. Without proper protective equipment, many suffer from &lt;strong&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/strong&gt; due to prolonged exposure to hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With an &lt;strong&gt;average life expectancy of only 40 years&lt;/strong&gt;, these miners endure some of the harshest working conditions in the world, making Kawah Ijen not just a place of natural wonder, but also of human struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Balance Between Tourism and Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blue flames of Kawah Ijen have become a major tourist attraction, drawing adventurers from all over the world. Guided treks begin in the early hours of the morning, allowing visitors to witness the mesmerizing blue glow before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;strong&gt;rising popularity of the site&lt;/strong&gt; comes with environmental and safety concerns. Unregulated tourism and increasing foot traffic threaten the delicate ecosystem of the &lt;strong&gt;acidic lake and sulfur fields&lt;/strong&gt;. At the same time, tourists venturing too close to the flames without proper gas masks risk severe &lt;strong&gt;respiratory distress&lt;/strong&gt; from the toxic fumes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts are being made to ensure that conservation measures are put in place while allowing sustainable tourism, but striking this balance remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Place of Danger and Wonder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawah Ijen is a land of extremes, where &lt;strong&gt;fire burns blue, water is acid&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners battle&lt;strong&gt; deadly gases daily&lt;/strong&gt;. This volcanic marvel, with its otherworldly glow and hazardous conditions, showcases the delicate and often perilous balance between nature’s breathtaking beauty and its raw, destructive power.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with around one million deaths and two million new cases reported in 2020. This disease primarily affects people over 50, and its increasing prevalence poses a growing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRC originates in the colon or rectum, where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and can spread to other organs, such as the liver and lungs. Conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, are often accompanied by significant side effects like immunosuppression, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-develop-worlds-first-universal-gene-therapy-for-anemia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;, and organ toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to these drugs, diminishing their effectiveness. These challenges highlight an urgent need for safer, more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research offers hope by exploring alternative treatments derived from natural compounds. One such candidate is Artemisia herba-alba, a small, aromatic shrub commonly known as white wormwood or desert wormwood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Inhibitory effect escalating concentration of A. herba-alba extract on cell viability of various colon cancer cell lines after (A) 24 h and (B) 48 h of incubation.

The plant is known for its greenish-silver leaves and strong aromatic scent. It has long been valued in traditional medicine for its diverse therapeutic properties, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fish-guts-could-be-the-future-of-skin-care-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibacterial&lt;/a&gt;, antifungal, antispasmodic, and vasorelaxant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret behind these medicinal properties lies in its rich phytochemical composition. The plant contains a variety of compounds, including flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, monoterpenoids, and essential oils. These natural chemicals are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic effects. They not only boost the immune system but also demonstrate significant anticancer properties by targeting cancer cells selectively, leaving healthy cells unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sharjah.ac.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; revealed that an extract from Artemisia herba-alba exhibited strong anti-cancer properties against colorectal cancer cells. Published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.4715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research highlights the plant’s potential to disrupt cancer cell growth and induce cell death without harming normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that Artemisia herba-alba has great potential as a new tool in fighting CRC (colorectal cancer),” said Dr. Lara Bou Malhab, the study’s lead author and research associate at Sharjah University’s Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences. “It could be a promising natural ingredient for new cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_artemisia_herba_alba_targets_cancer_cells"&gt;How Artemisia herba-alba Targets Cancer Cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved extracting active compounds from the aerial parts of Artemisia herba-alba collected from southern Jordan. After drying and grinding the plant material into fine powder, researchers used a methanol-based extraction process to obtain the highest concentration of phytochemicals. This extract was then tested on eight different colorectal cancer cell lines to evaluate its impact on cancer cell growth, survival, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba extract on different cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic markers proteins.

The extract not only inhibited the growth of cancer cells but also triggered apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death crucial for eliminating cancer cells. It disrupted the cell cycle by reducing the activity of proteins like Cyclin B1 and CDK1, which are essential for cancer cell division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the extract blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, a key driver of cancer development and progression. This pathway plays a significant role in cell survival, proliferation, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-mrna-vaccine-revolutionizes-pancreatic-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism in cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;. By inhibiting this pathway, Artemisia herba-alba effectively starved the cancer cells of the signals they need to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study underscores the extract's selective cytotoxicity against CRC cell lines, highlighting its potential to serve as a complementary treatment to existing cancer therapies,” Dr. Bou Malhab explained. “Our findings highlight the immense potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural source for developing innovative therapies against colorectal cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_frontier_in_cancer_treatment"&gt;A New Frontier in Cancer Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer properties is significant for several reasons. First, it offers a potential alternative to traditional chemotherapy, which often causes severe side effects and faces issues of drug resistance. Natural compounds like those found in Artemisia herba-alba provide a more targeted and less toxic approach to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba on different cell death markers p-AKT and p-mTOR. (CREDIT: Food Science and Nutrition) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, this study emphasizes the importance of exploring traditional medicinal plants as sources of new therapeutic agents. In many cultures, Artemisia herba-alba has been used for centuries to treat a range of health issues, including fever, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory problems. Its potential as an anticancer agent not only validates traditional knowledge but also opens up new avenues for scientific exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s success is also credited to the collaboration between researchers from the University of Sharjah and the University of Jordan. The botanical identification of the plant specimens was conducted by Prof. M. Hudaib, an expert in Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jordan's School of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers emphasized the importance of further investigation to fully understand the molecular mechanisms behind Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bou Malhab stressed the need for continued research to explore the clinical efficacy of Artemisia herba-alba, stating, “Our findings demonstrate its cytotoxic effects, ability to induce apoptosis, and its capacity to arrest the cell cycle. This suggests a wider therapeutic significance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_future_of_artemisia_herba_alba_in_cancer_therapy"&gt;The Future of Artemisia herba-alba in Cancer Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural anti-cancer agent is groundbreaking. As CRC cases continue to rise worldwide, there is an urgent need for treatments that are not only more effective but also less harmful than conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed through further research and clinical trials, Artemisia herba-alba could become an essential component of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-links-coffee-to-cancer-heart-disease-and-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It might be used in combination with existing treatments to enhance their effectiveness and reduce side effects. Additionally, its natural origin could lead to more affordable cancer treatments, making them accessible to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the journey from laboratory research to clinical application is long and complex. More in-depth studies are required to understand the exact mechanisms of its anticancer action, optimal dosage, and potential side effects. The researchers call for extensive preclinical and clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of Artemisia herba-alba in treating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where cancer remains one of the leading &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/groundbreaking-cancer-treatment-destroys-99-of-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of new, effective, and safe treatments is a beacon of hope. Artemisia herba-alba, an ancient remedy, may well be the key to modern cancer therapy, providing a natural and powerful weapon against one of the deadliest forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPbG1SaGlybmU4dEhKTVJuRTdqVlpTNk5RNnVOTEZKa3NrQUg3SFFaRDVrSjJaRTlzdEhNR3dKWXVvMS1pZ0JsaXVBQVlvNjg3emROeC1ORndacDBhYzJJZklBYzQzd2w2bFlsbDdlWmlRX1l1LVpzM1AzeTQ4YXVzOFg1dDBFRmo1Y25sWS1QRE0wemtweDU4QWdTTE5Ndw</guid></item><item><title>6 ‘Bad’ Foods You Should Be Eating for Better Heart Health, According to Dietitians - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5ESlBCT0NycEFLb2dDYmFfRERmQ0ZJWHp0dmNNWkg5TlNkd0MwaUg2NmpWTmplNTVBNTVPN2w2cThEZ25zZ3ZWYXJFS1JCLWRhNVFYa3VFUWNDYVZrdUlXSGxybnZGRzV1YjlTdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Jessica Ball, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo: Robby Lozano. EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complete protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Full-Fat Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.” Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Shellfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cocoa is rich in flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 36 grams of fiber per day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on soluble fiber sources, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to prioritize omega-3 fatty acids from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eggs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-shellfish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Shellfish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-chocolate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Chocolate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;Research shows eating fish supports brain structure and reduces inflammation, thanks to DHA, a type of omega-3 found in high levels in fish. Yet in the UK we have low levels of omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-3s have a direct influence on the cell membranes of our brains, but they’re also recognised as a potential prebiotic, having a similar effect to fibre in terms of feeding our gut microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 is also found in walnuts and chia seeds, but this form is harder for our bodies to absorb than the DHA found in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-vegetarians should aim for two portions of fish a week and if you’re a vegetarian, look into an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why reducing stress is also important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut and brain health isn’t just about what’s on your plate. “Because the gut and brain are so interconnected via the gut-brain axis, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/toxic-stress-risk/"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can also alter the gut microbiome, reducing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help protect against inflammation in the brain. Managing stress through movement and mindfulness doesn’t just improve digestion—it actively supports memory, focus, and long-term brain health,” says Dr Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So find stress relief that works for you. That might be breathwork, yoga or even just regular five-minute screen breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is also a proven stress reliever. Strength training boosts short-chain fatty acid production in your gut, and lower-impact movements such as yoga, Pilates and walking help alleviate stress and encourage problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good night’s sleep is also vital for stress management and all-round health. “Your gut microbiome follows a daily rhythm, just like you do, and poor sleep can throw it off—leading to poor cognition and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends getting natural light within an hour of waking and ensuring a proper wind-down routine.&lt;/p&gt;

After the doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head, they were shocked to find a huge pocket of fluid where his brain was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scans shared with medical journal The Lancet, the main part of the man's brain area appears black, indicating where the build up of fluid was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man discovered he had been living with just half a brain after being hit by leg pain. The above image shows a build up of fluid - the black area - where his brain was mean to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drainage tubes in the patient's brain had narrowed, causing a build up of fluid to accumulate over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused his brain to squeeze into a narrow layer pushed against the rim of his skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, his skull had also enlarged. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case, Lionel Feuillet, a neurologist at the Mediterranean University in Marseilles, said at the time the case report was published in 2004: 'We were very surprised when we looked for the first time the CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain was very, very much smaller than normal. This case is unique to our knowledge.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that his team had 'never encountered such severe hydrocephalus before' and it is likely the man had the condition from birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to see how his condition had affected his mental ability, the doctors carried out a series of psychological tests on the male patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were further surprised to find that he was still able to function sufficiently with an IQ of 75, at the lower end of the 'normal' range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man also had built a successful life for himself, with a wife, two children and a job as a civil servant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans revealed only a narrow rim of brain material pressed against the man's skull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that the problems with his left leg were a neurological symptom of the man's brain condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain' affects one out of every 770 babies, making it as common as Down syndrome and more common than spina bifida or brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is most common in both infants and older adults and it can be asymptomatic, which explains why the man went for years without noticing an impact to his health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the common symptoms, when they do surface, include h&lt;span&gt;eadaches, n&lt;/span&gt;ausea and vomiting, difficulty walking, vision problems, memory problems, incontinence and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment is shunt surgery and if it is left&lt;span&gt; untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal due to increased pressure compressing the brainstem, which is responsible for regulating heart rates and breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A patient's prognosis after surgery depends on their age and general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>CNY SPCA Pet of the Week: Houdini deserves gentleness - syracuse.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQN2NtT3p3V2JtRWw1OERkM09oUWZWNDkzTzE0ckM3SkZKMU4ySzhxdU52a0hpSnFTM1BIRUF2WmR6cXZSRHIyNmhBX09pemdIOFNVM0oxa2pzOWJoR0taazJfa19ORno3YU16RHZsVDl1aDQxcGxkdDhvTEloa3NlZ2tXNl9qWnlJaXNSVmNnY2Rpem01emtQaFF0am9pUdIBsgFBVV95cUxNc0gyU2JxcFBGZ2F2Y2hWOWYxaEVqMDcweEVVTXVFZ21oTGFyVGlySmkwZnhiVFNscVRFVnRiZWNlZlgtM2djLUQ4SDBEbTB3NHNlemJzdTk5VzE3Q0xQV0ZWc1puVkVaX2h2S2JRZGw3NldYSXNTMFFTalJWRWFzMWxMbEozeDZIeHlySzZCLWxGY0FpY3J0bkxXYjZFbHRLODNXbWtjU2ZkZzRET1NPbF9B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OQA7VX6CXFF5TI5VX37EGRWIFQ"&gt;Houdini is a friendly ten-year-old orange and white cat who came to the shelter as part of a cruelty case and is looking for a home that can provide lots of gentleness and scritches.

(Vercammen was not involved in the new study.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering these treatments should have an "in-depth conversation" with a doctor about the potential benefits and weigh them against the "significant risks" involved, according to Vercammen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These risks include the possibility of serious side effects, such as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain swelling and bleeding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain swelling and bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the substantial financial costs associated with treatment, even if you have insurance coverage," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who may benefit from these treatments, Hartz recommended they talk to their doctors and review the potential risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This information could help contextualize how the medications may benefit them in terms of independence," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the makers of Leqembi and Kisunla to request comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/two-alzheimers-drugs-help-patients-live-independently-home-longer-periods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1hLW1CMkVUemlWN0hnXzJCUGQyTlF2YnFCdk5rcW1fbGU1XzVaeUlVLTlWb1dGbXZrRlZSc2QtMDVIUU4ySHJoaVJPclBBRWxNaTRaMFM4Yi1teXhYMXZSQlhPb0g3eDhTbWdzb0pDMnc1Wi1xVUVr</guid></item><item><title>New Five-Type Index Provides Doctors Guide for Long COVID - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of long COVID patients has identified five distinct subtypes that researchers say will help doctors diagnose the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2828329?guestAccessKey=77bdd800-1217-41f0-bada-33a43d62bde1&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121824"&gt;new five-type index&lt;/a&gt;, developed by federal researchers with the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER COVID Initiative, identified the most common symptoms in 14,000 people with long COVID, with data from an additional 4000 people added to the updated 2024 index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the index, physicians and researchers can better understand the condition, which is difficult to treat and diagnose because no standard definitions or therapies have been developed. Doctors can use the index to offer more targeted care and help patients manage their symptoms more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index may also help researchers find more treatments for long COVID. Because long COVID can affect so many different parts of the body, it will take time to fully understand how to treat it, but studies like this are making progress in the right direction, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new index uses an updated point system, where points are allotted to each symptom in a list of the 44 most reported symptoms in people with likely long COVID based on how often they occur. Among people in the study with prior COVID infection, 2213 (18%) met the threshold for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 44 most common symptoms were then distributed among five subtypes, with each representing a difference in impact on quality of life and overall health. The most common symptoms were fatigue (85.8%), postexertional malaise (87.4%), and postexertional soreness (75.0%) — where persistent fatigue and discomfort occur after physical or mental exertion — dizziness (65.8%), brain fog (63.8%), gastrointestinal symptoms (59.3%), and palpitations (58%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with prior COVID infection, symptoms were more prevalent in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those grouped into subtype 1 did not report a high incidence of impact on quality of life, physical health, or daily function. Only 21% of people in subtype 1 reported a “poor or fair quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change in smell or taste — usually a symptom that’s bothersome but doesn’t seriously impact overall health — was most present in subtype 1, with 100% of people in subtype 1 reporting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other symptoms in over 50% of people with subtype 1— which were 490 of the 2213 with prior COVID infection — were fatigue (66%), postexertional malaise (53%), and postexertional soreness (55%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these two symptoms can certainly impact quality of life, they became much more prevalent in other subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of possibly debilitating symptoms like postexertional malaise (94%), fatigue (81%), and chronic cough (100%) rose dramatically in people grouped into subtype 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, 25% of people in subtype 2 reported a “poor or fair quality of life. Postexertional malaise, I think, is probably one of the most debilitating of the symptoms. When somebody comes in and tells me that they’re tired and I think they might have long COVID, the first thing I try to do is see if it is postexertional malaise vs just postinfectious fatigue,” said Lisa Sanders, MD, medical director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2023/11/08/a-different-spirit-of-research-yale-clinic-seeks-to-unravel-the-mystery-of-long-covid/"&gt;Long Covid Multidisciplinary Care Center&lt;/a&gt; in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postinfectious fatigue usually resolves much more quickly than postexertional malaise. The latter accounts for several symptoms as also associated with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a chronic illness that causes severe fatigue and makes it difficult for sufferers to perform routine, daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Postexertional malaise is an additive symptom of ME/CFS, and that can take a long time to resolve,” Sanders added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarity between these two symptoms highlights the importance that physicians must place in scrutinizing symptoms to a high degree when they suspect a patient of having long COVID, experts said. By doing so, clinicians can unveil the mask of overlapping symptoms between long COVID symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 37% of people grouped in subtype 3 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a significant rise from subtypes 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue symptoms were reported by 92%, whereas 82% reported postexertional soreness, and 70% reported dizziness. Additionally, 100% of people in subtype 3 reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders said these symptoms are also common in people with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This condition results from a reduced volume of blood returning to the heart after standing up, which leads to an abnormally fast heart rate. Palpitations and fainting can then occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-to-manage-long-covid-brain-fog"&gt;Brain fog can be especially debilitating&lt;/a&gt; in people who are used to multitasking. With brain fog, people accustomed to easily alternating between tasks or doing multiple tasks at once can only do one thing at a time. This can cause stress and an overload of thoughts, even precipitating a change in careers if severe enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though brain fog tends to resolve within 6-9 months after infection, it can last up to 18 months or more. Experts say doctors should always be on the lookout if a patient complains they have trouble concentrating or multitasking in the months after a COVID infection. A neurological exam and cognitive testing can identify abnormalities in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 40% of people in the study grouped into subtype 4 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a modest increase from those with subtype 3. About 65% reported symptoms of brain fog and 92% reported palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizziness was also prevalent at 71%, whereas 60% reported gastrointestinal issues, and 36% said they experienced fever, sweats, and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 700 of the 2213 people fell into this subtype group, by far the highest number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 66% of people in subtype 5 reported a poor to fair quality of life. These people usually reported multisystem symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of prevalence rises across the spectrum of 44 common long COVID symptoms, 99% reported shortness of breath; 98%, postexertional soreness; 94%, dizziness; 92%, postexertional malaise; 80%, GI problems; 78%, weakness; and 69%, chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of Hispanic and multiracial participants were classified as having subtype 5. Also, according to the study, “higher proportions of unvaccinated participants and those with SARS-CoV-2 infection before circulation of the Omicron variant were in subtype 5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests the severity of the Delta variant of COVID-19 be linked to some of the worst long COVID symptoms, but further study would have to be done to conclusively determine may be just a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Do Symptoms Resolve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sanders, around 17 million Americans are thought to have long COVID. Although 90%-100% of people typically recover within 3 years, that still leaves possibly around 5% of those who don’t recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What people usually say is, ‘I got COVID, and I never quite recovered,” Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five percent of 17 million turns out to be a lot. It’s a lot of suffering,” she added. “I would say that the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, anosmia or dysgeusia, and sleep disorders,” as evidenced by the high percentage of people in certain subtypes of the study reporting a poor quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR</guid></item><item><title>Why Your Dentist May Be Able To Identify A New Alzheimer's Warning Sign - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPNXNvVmFsV1FnbUwyNFB4OC1iSW5KbnRqTjVoTVF6VnVMY29yREtkYnNRcVZ0aFk4UUxUSEh6VmhrVEVSY3VjaWdHX2YxeC1tUFNEM1cxeHdERXZyRzJsQUN3YzVWeGpIdjZEUTRVRVFSa0RrdmNKOUpQNGNWV0hwZWJJSVZPS3k2Nmt2Nm8zTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-tey52c et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just like your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reproductive organs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;reproductive organs&lt;/a&gt;, your mouth has its very own microbiome that plays a role in your health and wellness.

The participants were broken into two groups: One group had no detectable decline in brain function, while the others had mild cognitive impairment, a condition where people have more memory or thinking problems than others their age. People with mild cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The study participants provided the scientists with mouth rinse samples, which were then analyzed, allowing the researchers to break down the bacteria contained in each sample.

They also suggest that a bacterial imbalance could impact how much nitric oxide is formed from nitrate, a compound in vegetables. Nitric oxide is important for memory and communication in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But it’s hard to say for sure that the bacteria causes dementia or issues with brain health, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark S.

Did one cause the other or did they just both occur because we weren't taking good care of our mouth while we were developing the Alzheimer's disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-make-sure-to-have-the-good-bacteria-in-my-mouth" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I make sure to have the “good bacteria” in my mouth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Eating a plant-based diet seems to be a good start, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Bramen, PhD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Adding nitrate-rich foods like veggies into your diet “can benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes,” she says. This may also help to suppress bacteria that’s linked with dementia, Bramen explains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Again, it’s hard to say at this point that these bacteria cause Alzheimer’s disease, they're just linked.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have some news to share with all of you this morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have been together for a long time and I have shared a lot with you over the years. Unfortunately ,I have some difficult news to tell you about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recently found out that I have prostate cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luckily, we found it early and it is curable. But I need to attend to it and get better so I can be back to where I belong with my “GO!” team and all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will be out for a period of time recovering -- hopefully quickly -- and when I get back, I plan to share my journey with all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, I will be excited to get back to normal and get back to the routine as soon as I can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough to share, but it is what it is. And I’ll be back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave also had this message for 3News' Danita Harris and Matt Wintz:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate you guys more than you know," he told them. "I appreciate everything you’ve done so far through the journey. I’ll be thinking about you, and I’ll be updating everyone as we go along, but I will be back. This is where I love to be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danita told Dave the "GO!" family "will be with you every step of the way."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We love you and care about you," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;20th February 2025 – (Arizona) A recent study monitoring the brain activity of a clinically dead patient has revealed a mysterious burst of energy, reigniting debates over the nature of consciousness and the possibility of the soul leaving the body after death. Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an anaesthesiologist and professor at the University of Arizona, described the phenomenon as a sudden spike in gamma synchrony—a brain wave pattern associated with awareness and perception—detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“They saw everything go away, and then [psh], you got this activity when there was no blood pressure, no heart rate,” Dr. Hameroff explained in an interview with Project Unity. “So that could be the near-death experience, or it could be the soul leaving the body, perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The activity, which lasted between 30 to 90 seconds, occurred after the patient was declared clinically dead. While sceptics argue it could be the “last gasp” of neurons firing or an illusion, Dr. Hameroff suggests it may indicate consciousness persisting at a deeper, low-energy level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings echo earlier research by Dr. Lakhmir Chawla, who pioneered EEG monitoring of brain-dead patients to ensure no brain activity before organ donation. Dr. Hameroff noted that such bursts of activity are reproducible, occurring in about 50% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hameroff also referenced a study by Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, where volunteers given psilocybin reported vivid hallucinations despite showing minimal brain activity on MRI scans. This, he speculates, could point to consciousness operating at a quantum level within neurons—a theory that challenges traditional neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think consciousness is actually low energy,” Dr. Hameroff concluded, suggesting it may be “the last thing to go” during the dying process.&lt;/p&gt;

The exception is when temperatures spike to extremely high numbers, like 105 or 106 degrees, he says. “Then, indeed, you can have problems,” and seeking medical attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no4-fever-reducing-medications-will-help-you-get-better"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Fever-reducing medications will help you get better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking an over-the-counter medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help you feel better in the moment. “But it is not going to actually kill the virus or bacteria causing the infection,” Young says. Instead, these medications can be helpful in treating the symptoms linked with a fever like body aches, chills, sweats and fatigue, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These medications can help you to feel more comfortable while you ride it out,” Schaffner explains. “If the fever is caused by something like an influenza infection, those medications won’t do anything for the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no5-you-need-to-call-a-doctor-every-time-you-have-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: You need to call a doctor every time you have a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not necessarily. If you feel uncomfortable but are able to get your symptoms under control with the help of fever-reducing medications, Schaffner says, there’s no need to call a doctor. But if your fever lingers for several days, makes you feel debilitated or confused or you have no idea what could be causing your lingering fever, it’s time to be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also necessary to contact a health care provider sooner if the patient is in a vulnerable group. “For some individuals, fevers can be more serious than for others — particularly the very young, the very old or individuals with a weakened immune system,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no6-no-touch-thermometers-are-as-accurate-as-gold-standard-oral-ones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 6: No-touch thermometers are as accurate as gold-standard oral ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No-touch thermometers have been around for years, but they became massively popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schaffner suggests getting a few readings with a no-touch thermometer to see how consistent they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no7-all-fevers-need-to-be-treated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 7: All fevers need to be treated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A fever is a sign that your body is fighting off an infection, Schaffner says. “But there’s a distinction between the cause of the fever and the fever itself,” he says. If you have a lower fever and you feel generally OK, Schaffner says you don’t need to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you have a fever and feel lousy, taking an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help you feel better and even bring the fever down, he says. Still, Young says that fevers won’t necessarily continue to go up if you don’t treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever, Schaffner recommends doing your best to stay well hydrated. “Try to rest and be alert to see whatever else is happening in your body,” he says. “If someone else is going on, that’s a signal to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:00:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNanNlTUxHOTVoR01YY0dMZHpta25JcTBsYm9kQU53TkxjdGFPazN0Z2xLemdBY3BUclVEeDhiN2RFaUN0djMzSUNhaE1lamZUdHBvYmFId2Nram5NWlNLQVVFcGo0YjBoVF9zLVREM1ZMT3MydFl3cjB2WHJ6X2tzdkdFU2xEQzg0eHBPdldlcS14OWhzU0tPWEgwMlBnYUdheTdYNw</guid></item><item><title>Doctors set the record straight on 7 common fever myths - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbzdFVHVYX1E0cmlsSVkxX1pMdldSUG44LU9Xd01QOFdDTm5vSDZNcEJYeFFxcFR0d0trSERRNUNkcmFfdDRQVzFzRFVuSEZjdUkyUWpvR3dSOG8xVlJQbE93cEhlNllZV3lqQW16OXE3a1BsdkU0bjBpeHNXM3p6d3ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-levels-are-the-highest-theyve-been-since-2009-the-cdc-says-the-latest-on-winter-illnesses-including-rsv-covid-19-and-more-152406954.html" data-ylk="slk:a lot of flu cases;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a lot of flu cases&lt;/a&gt; right now — at least &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20CDC,the%202009%2D2010%20flu%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:29 million;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;29 million&lt;/a&gt; so far this season, making this the worst flu season the U.S. has seen in nearly a decade, according to data from the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Still, Young says that fevers won’t necessarily continue to go up if you don’t treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever, Schaffner recommends doing your best to stay well hydrated. “Try to rest and be alert to see whatever else is happening in your body,” he says. “If someone else is going on, that’s a signal to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:00:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbzdFVHVYX1E0cmlsSVkxX1pMdldSUG44LU9Xd01QOFdDTm5vSDZNcEJYeFFxcFR0d0trSERRNUNkcmFfdDRQVzFzRFVuSEZjdUkyUWpvR3dSOG8xVlJQbE93cEhlNllZV3lqQW16OXE3a1BsdkU0bjBpeHNXM3p6d3ln</guid></item><item><title>Doctored by Charles Piller review – the scandal that derailed Alzheimer’s research - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPa1FGdXdXQnpuR25JenA4a3ZCVWtXR3ZwVzZ1N0FSelFFMWNQcWJaVnlnclZTaC1vb19DVnB3RmhKVE9SQjd1bkJ5NzF3YUwzeGlyNDk4anRGMkM1NXRfNjhvRUNaN0ZrZE1WT09rMzgyYVptUHNrbU1tWUNwb0o2N29ESlRMR2lhZTc1Z1k3YmpQSXZSTzhtWFdKN0xmWmo0Zm5JOHo0dzh1X0MtNlRhbnhtUXNvWVk2anZ5NHlQd3VEWWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;iving to old age is quite literally the best thing that any of us could hope for, given the alternative. It’s a cruel irony, then, that many of us who make it that far will begin to lose our sense of who we are due to dementia. If you’re 65, you’ve got about a one in 20 chance of developing the most common form, Alzheimer’s disease, in the next decade. At 75, it’s about one in seven, while those fortunate enough to reach 85 face a one in three chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Given the toll this illness takes on sufferers and those around them, hundreds of millions of families around the world are desperate for a medical breakthrough – and for years, headlines have suggested that it might be imminent. Scientists had identified the cause of Alzheimer’s, they promised, and potential cures were already being tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector"

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The subtitle of Doctored – Fraud, Arrogance and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s &lt;em&gt;– &lt;/em&gt;serves as a spoiler as to how that story ends, at least for the moment. The fraud uncovered by a rag-tag group of researchers into academic integrity and extensively documented here by Charles Piller, an investigative journalist for the magazine Science, feels like the kind of scandal that should have had wall-to-wall coverage. And yet, outside scientific circles, it remains relatively low-profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The story is complicated, but a summary might go like this: for decades, something called the amyloid hypothesis has dominated research into Alzheimer’s, determining how billions of dollars of public and private funding into new drugs was spent. The brains of people who had died with it showed clumps of sticky protein – called amyloid plaques – between neurons. It seemed logical that these might be responsible for the disease’s symptoms. And while this became the main line of inquiry, it never quite delivered on its early promise. Many people with amyloid plaques didn’t have signs of Alzheimer’s, for example. Something seemed to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;And then came what seemed like decisive proof: a 2006 paper from the University of Minnesota, which went on to become one of the most cited in the field, showed that a sub-type of amyloid led to memory impairment. It wasn’t until 2022 that scientific sleuths &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/23/alzheimers-study-fraudulent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that key images on which the research relied might have been Photoshopped to better fit the hypothesis. At first, the scientists fought back against the claims, but the 2006 paper has now been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt;, as have others based around the same findings. As the book explains, investigations continue and several key figures involved deny any knowledge of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than read&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The implication is that years of work and billions of dollars spent on Alzheimer’s research may have been carried out on the basis of fraudulent evidence.

As the book continues, it becomes an ever more uncomfortable read: the tale starts with the alleged fakery of images by one, or a handful, of scientists. By the end, we’re left wondering if any research can really be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than it is to read.

								&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matt Teegarden likes to compare apples to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt;. Or, at the very least, he wants studies on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/01/should-we-be-afraid-of-ultra-processed-foods-its-complicated/"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;to compare apples to applesauce—not just apples to orange juice. That distinction, he argued in a Wednesday seminar hosted by the &lt;a href="https://www.ift.org/"&gt;Institute of Food Technologists&lt;/a&gt;, is crucial in parsing the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/nutrition"&gt;nutritional &lt;/a&gt;complexity of modern food processing. As it stands, many of the most-cited studies on the topic conflate categories in ways that obscure rather than illuminate the role of processing in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation around ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has accelerated in recent years, with public health advocates and consumers alike turning to the NOVA classification system to decode the complexities of modern food production. But Teegarden, a food scientist and chemist, alongside Dr. Susanne Bügel, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, suggests that the system is oversimplified, failing to account for the nuances of nutrition, formulation and processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA system — &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which was developed in the early 2000s by researchers at the University of São Paulo, led by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Monteiro — classifies foods into four categories: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like fresh fruit and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients, like &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/19/youre-using-olive-oil-the-way-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;oils&lt;/a&gt; and sugars; processed foods, such as canned vegetables or tinned fish; and ultra-processed foods, which include packaged snacks, sodas and flavored yogurts. The issue, Teegarden pointed out, is that the system treats vastly different foods as nutritionally equivalent simply because they undergo a similar level of processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loaf of whole wheat bread, for instance, can be classified as either a category 2 or a category 4 food, depending on the production method. The same goes for yogurt and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/01/23/youre-only-3-ingredients-and-10-minutes-away-from-the-herbiest-bean-soup-ever/"&gt;canned beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If beans are just canned in water and a little bit of salt, that would be group three,” Teerfarden said. “But if maybe they have EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] added for color retention, that would be seen as a cosmetic additive, and they would be group four, even though they're virtually the same product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bügel is leading an initiative aimed at refining this approach. Her team is working on a classification system that integrates processing methods with nutritional content, providing a more holistic view of a food’s health impact. She points out that foods like mass-produced packaged breads, breakfast &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/07/revisiting-millsberry-the-wild-rise-and-fall-of-general-mills-virtual-cereal-themed-town/"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and fruit yogurts are classified as ultra-processed under the NOVA system, yet despite this classification, these products still offer significant nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult to use [the NOVA system], both for the professionals and for the consumers,” she said. “For the professionals, we have to guess whether people are eating bread bought in a supermarket or bread bought in a bakery. It’s absolutely not based on scientific evidence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oversimplifications of the NOVA system become even more apparent when examining epidemiological studies linking UPFs to negative health outcomes. Many rely on dietary recall data, a notoriously unreliable metric, and don’t necessarily track food consumption with processing levels in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Importantly with NOVA, the data that’s been collected in a lot of the studies that have been published thus far, the data is not necessarily collected with processing in mind,” Teergarden said. “In fact, a lot of the data was collected before NOVA was even invented. We have a lot of historical data here. So the processing levels of the foods in these dietary surveys are actually implied.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That imprecision, coupled with the broad category definitions, has led to some dubious findings. One study, Teegarden pointed out, found a correlation between UPF consumption and accidental death — a statistical oddity that likely indicates residual confounding rather than causation. “So be careful if you’re eating a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/candy"&gt;candy bar &lt;/a&gt;and walking under an air conditioning unit,” he joked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies, while more rigorous, still struggle with the challenge of isolating processing as an independent health factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the gold standard for nutritional research is the randomized controlled trial, which allows scientists to isolate specific dietary variables. Only a handful of such studies exist on UPFs, but they do suggest that ultra-processed diets may encourage overeating. However, Teegarden argues that even these studies lack crucial nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, a recent study conducted in Japan. On the first day, participants assigned to the ultra-processed diet were given fried chicken, biscuits and a giant bowl of sweetened yogurt. Meanwhile, the minimally processed diet featured rice, vegetables and lean protein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects,” he said. “We're testing these overall dietary patterns. So we're missing the buck a little bit here because we've controlled for nutrient content, but we haven't controlled for food type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy ignores an inconvenient truth: Some UPFs contribute meaningfully to a balanced diet. Fortified cereals provide essential micronutrients, plant-based milks cater to those with dairy intolerances and some packaged breads offer whole grains that many people wouldn’t otherwise consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal, according to both Teegarden and Bügel, shouldn’t be to demonize processing as a concept, but rather to refine how we assess its impact on health. A smarter classification system — one that accounts for processing, formulation and nutrition — could help public health officials provide more accurate dietary guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the conversation about ultra-processed foods remains muddied, shaped more by broad-strokes panic than by the scientific precision it deserves. And if we want to truly understand the role of processing in modern diets, we need to move beyond comparing apples to orange juice — and start comparing apples to applesauce.&lt;/p&gt;

"I never thought twice about it," says Hill, now a researcher who teaches evolutionary psychology at Texas Christian University, an institution affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States. It was only when she switched contraceptives, 12 years after starting to take the pill, that an epiphany dawned on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"My life felt brighter and more interesting, like I had walked out of a 2D black-and-white movie into a full-colour, 3D, meaning-filled reality," says Hill. Her experiences of taking oral contraceptives inspired her to study the science involved and publish a book, &lt;i id="how-the-pill-changes-everything" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;How the Pill Changes Everything&lt;/i&gt;, in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In addition to discussing legitimate concerns, social media influencers have been &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66671765" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;spreading misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about the contraceptive pill's side effects, both mental and physical. While they may have no medical background, some are even encouraging women to abandon contraception altogether – a trend which some experts believe could be behind a recent spike in &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnvjl27rrjzo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;abortions in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But can the pill really alter one's personality and outlook on life?

First, there's the most popular kind, the combined pill, which contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone. The other is the progestogen-only pill, or "mini-pill". Both work to prevent pregnancy &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/combinedcontraceptivepill/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in a handful of ways&lt;/a&gt;, including suppressing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to make it harder for a sperm to penetrate and reach an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, the hormones in oral contraceptives don't just affect the body, they can also have powerful effects on women's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp" alt="Dempsey Ewan There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"The impact of hormones on the brain is complicated," says Johannes Bitzer, an obstetrician-gynaecologist (OBGYN) and psychotherapist at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. "For some individuals, the pill has a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39424518/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;positive effect on mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;.

Some sexual health providers in the UK and the US make no mention whatsoever of the mental side effects of the pill on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think the big issue is that in OBGYN training, mental health is not a subject. It's for the psychiatrists," says Bitzer, who has been in the field for nearly 40 years. Things are slowly changing, but "before, when we discussed the pill, we talked about thrombosis, cancer, irregular bleeding, weight gain, and so on. The issue of mental health was more or less excluded," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There hadn't been much investigation into potential mental side effects from researchers, either. But a shift started taking place in 2016, says Bitzer, when a group from Denmark published a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27680324/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, leading to more research in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the original Danish study, researchers dug into the country's national health database to track the mental health of over a million women aged between 15 and 34 over a period of 14 years. They discovered that women who started taking the combined pill were 70% more likely to be prescribed antidepressants six months later, as compared to those who had never taken oral contraceptives. For those starting on the mini-pill, the risk was 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In 2023, a separate group of researchers gleaned &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37303201/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;similar results&lt;/a&gt; when they analysed the health records of a quarter of a million women in the UK Biobank, a large repository of genetic and medical information. Pill-users, they found, were 71% more likely to be depressed compared with never-users, two years after beginning their contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"There's a convincing temporal association between starting use of these products and then developing depression symptoms," says Øjvind Lidegaard, a medical epidemiologist specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Copenhagen, who led the Danish study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, both of these studies were "cohort studies", conducted by analysing the data of large groups of women, and comparing the mental health outcomes of those who were taking oral contraceptives with those who weren’t. This means they were able to identify if there was an association between these two things, but not unravel whether there was cause and effect. There could, for example, be some pre-existing differences between the groups of women that affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Conflicting results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Some studies seem to contradict the correlation between certain mental health conditions and oral contraceptive use. For instance, when researchers at Ohio State University &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29496297/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;reviewed 26 earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, they found only a "minimal" link between progestogen-only methods of contraception and depression. Separately, in two clinical trials, each involving between 200 and 340 women in Sweden, researchers concluded that the combined pill &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28433366/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;didn't lead to depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923181/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;worsening mood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Intriguingly, taking a "break" from oral contraceptives – as is required for seven days each month with many types of the combined pill – can lead to mood worsening, according to some findings. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37755829/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 pill-taking women in Austria, some of whom were long-term users, participants reported feeling a 7% increase in anxiety during their pill pause, as well as a 13% and 24% rise in negative feelings and mental health symptoms, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"So from a mental health perspective, it might be more beneficial for contraceptive users to go for continuous use," says Belinda Pletzer, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Salzburg, who is leading an EU-funded &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.europeandissemination.eu/becontra/11695" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to study the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the female brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pletzer doesn't discount the fact that some women do suffer poorly, psychologically speaking, when on the pill, and that these symptoms should be taken seriously. "But it's just a small percentage of women," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One reason to explain the vast discrepancy in study findings on the mental side-effects of oral contraceptives is quite simply the nature of what's at hand, says Helena Kopp Kallner, an OBGYN at Danderyd Hospital near Stockholm in Sweden. Namely, that mental health conditions are often measured subjectively, and are notoriously difficult to study. Add to that that there are many different pill types (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/combination-birth-control-pills" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;over 30 brands of the combined pill exist&lt;/a&gt;), so often scientists might end up comparing apples to oranges, she says. The different studies also use varying methodologies, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp" alt='Dempsey Ewan One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What researchers look for at the end of their study also affects their findings, adds Bitzer. In the Danish study, for instance, "the fact that you get prescribed antidepressants is not necessarily related to a diagnosis of depression, but to the practice of the doctor, which makes your outcome measure quite problematic", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It's also hard to prove cause-and-effect relationships from such observational studies, says Sofia Zettermark, a physician based in Gothenburg, Sweden, because there could be other factors – such as genetics and one's environment – that may influence the results. For example, when she analysed the health records of nearly a million women in the national Swedish registries, she discovered that women from low-income and immigrant backgrounds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e049553.long" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;were more sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to experiencing mood changes on hormonal contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Lidegaard, for his part, clarifies that his study must be understood in the wider context. "There's no doubt that some women who start using hormonal contraception experience severe changes in their mental health," says Lidegaard. "However, it's important to realise that it's only 7 to 8% who face so many mental incidences that they are forced to stop taking their medication...The majority of women taking these products don't feel any severe discomfort mentally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And of course, for some women the benefits of oral contraceptives may outweigh any side-effects. In addition to providing highly effective contraception, the combined and mini-pill can have other positive physical effects. "If you have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/#:~:text=Medicines%20are%20often%20the%20first,these%20can%20help%20ease%20pain" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/effects-on-periods/#:~:text=Methods%20of%20contraception%20that%20can%20help%20with%20heavy%20periods%20are,progestogen%2Donly%20pill" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;heavy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00774-2/pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;PMDD&lt;/a&gt; [premenstrual dysphoric disorder, an extreme and debilitating form of PMS], then the pill can actually help improve it," says Kopp Kallner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pregnancy itself can also involve significant health complications, particularly in the developing world. Meanwhile, several studies have found a link between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9072423/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20several%20studies%20have%20confirmed,during%20the%20course%20of%20pregnancy." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;unplanned pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Altering brain chemistry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But where there are impacts on mental health, how exactly does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There are many ways that oral contraceptives might be able to interfere with women's moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Instead, combined and mini-pills, as well as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), contain synthetic versions of these hormones which disrupt the natural progression of the menstrual cycle. This includes progestins, a group of artificial progestogen hormones that can be manufactured in a variety of ways, though the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563211/#:~:text=The%20testosterone%20derivatives%20are%20the,norethindrone%20acetate%2C%20ethynodiol%20diacetate%2C%20norethynodrel" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;majority are made from testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Neither synthetic oestrogens or progestins are chemically identical to the hormones naturally produced by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This is thought to have a number of consequences. One is that, in women who are taking the contraceptive pill, pathways involving the neurotransmitter serotonin – which is often described as the brain's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/serotonin-the-natural-mood-booster" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;natural "mood-booster"&lt;/a&gt; – might be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study, a group of Danish researchers analysed brain scans of 53 healthy women, 16 of which were taking oral contraceptive pills, to assess the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7586815/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;activity of the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the women using oral contraceptives had 9-12% lower levels of a certain type of serotonin signalling compared to the women who were not taking these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The effect was twice as large as the impact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are known to have on this particular kind of signalling. The researchers speculated that this might be the mechanism responsible for the link between oral contraceptives and depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's also some evidence that the artificial oestrogen and progestins present in oral contraceptives might interfere with the production of allopregnanolone, another hormone with crucial roles in the brain – particularly the regulation of mood and the body's stress response. A pharmaceutical version of this hormone was approved in the US in 2019 for the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289519300505" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;treatment of post-natal depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In women who are not taking artificial sex hormones, progesterone can be converted into allopregnanolone. But in women using the contraceptive pill, this process is thought to be disrupted: progestins don't get broken down into allopregnanolone, meaning they may miss out on some of its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study conducted in rats, those taking oral contraceptives had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305712001463" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;lower concentrations of allopregnanolone in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.

"What researchers have found is that you get a blunting of the cortisol response to stress that most naturally cycling women experience," explains Hill. "No cortisol equals no stress, which might sound like a good thing on the surface. But that's not how it works – cortisol isn't what causes stress, it's how our body helps cope with and recover from stress." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Adolescent risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's one group in particular that Lidegaard worries about: teenage girls. His study revealed that those aged between 15 and 19 were almost twice as likely (1.8 times) to receive an antidepressant prescription after starting the combined pill compared to those who did not take the pill. For those on the mini-pill, the risk was more than double (this group was 2.2 times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than those who did not take the pill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Similarly, Zettermark's study found that adolescent girls displayed the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29566064/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;strongest association&lt;/a&gt; between hormonal contraceptives and antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication use. Those aged 12 to 14 were 240% and 190% more likely to be prescribed the drugs within a year of starting the combined pill and mini-pill, respectively; or 52% and 83% if they were between 15 and 17 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In another study, based on the data from 264,557 women invovled with the UK Biobank, researchers found that those who had taken oral contraceptives at some point in their lives had a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/populationbased-cohort-study-of-oral-contraceptive-use-and-risk-of-depression/B3C611DD318D7DC536B4BD439343A5BD" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;higher risk of developing depression&lt;/a&gt; over their lifetime, but the risk was most pronounced during the first two years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Apart from adolescents, there's another group many physicians are wary of prescribing oral contraception to. "If you have been depressed previously, have recurrent depressions, or any psychiatric issues at all, you have an increased risk of feeling depressed on the pill," cautions Kopp Kallner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Experts such as Kopp Kallner say self-awareness is key – you should monitor your mood for a few months when you first start the pill, or switch from one brand to another. If you have concerns about how your contraception is affecting your mood, arrange to speak to your healthcare provider. With so &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/different-progestin-types-906936" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;many different types of progestins&lt;/a&gt;, and combinations of these with artificial oestrogen, not to mention the different doses and preparations, finding the right fit is "a little bit of an art," says Bitzer. "It's very much individualised treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, there are many other types of contraception available that either do not involve hormones or contain lower doses than oral contraceptives, including male and female condoms (which can also help protect against sexually transmitted diseases), the vaginal ring, the IUS (the hormonal coil), the IUD (the copper coil), and sterilisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For Hill, changing the method of contraception she used was life-altering.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; mpox a public health emergency of international concern last August as cases rose in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and spread to neighboring countries in Africa. USAid has been working to contain the virus through vaccination, testing and surveillance efforts on the ground. Last year, USAid and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0822-mpox-outbreak.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contributed&lt;/a&gt; $55m in emergency assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAid&lt;/a&gt; workers with knowledge of the agency’s mpox response said that not all of that money has been disbursed and is now frozen under the administration’s orders to stop nearly all humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to the funding freeze, USAid workers were evacuated from the country at the end of January, according to court filings. Until weeks ago, the United States was a leader in coordinating response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One USAid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said in planning meetings: “Immediately it’s eyes on USAid of, ‘What are you guys going to do?’ And so everybody’s lost right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The aid freeze has meant that some provinces in the country who depend solely on USAid funds have been stripped of any resources to contain the virus, the worker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We were working on creating a sustainable system that can respond not just to the current mpox outbreak but can be used in the future for any other outbreak and now we’re not sure if that will succeed,” said a second USAid worker with knowledge of the mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Just like all these increased cases of Ebola and Marburg in neighboring countries, it’s not if, but when the next one in the DRC will be and how the country is going to be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cutting off resources to contain the current outbreak only increases the chances of mpox spreading to more countries, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Disaster and catastrophe are the appropriate words for shutting down USAid. It’s not just about people overseas who will be affected but there’s a likelihood of mpox or the next pandemic spreading to the United States,” said a US-based researcher who studies infectious diseases and asked for anonymity because of ongoing projects with the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A global outbreak of mpox in 2022 led to more than 100,000 cases in 122 countries and marked the first time that the disease had spread outside of central or western &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak has largely been contained and the number of cases is low, in part due to widespread vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The more recent outbreak in DRC is a distinct variant from the mpox virus that caused the 2022 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio issued guidance that life-saving humanitarian assistance – including for food and medicine – may still be dispersed through a waiver despite the funding freeze. USAid workers said that while they have been seeking a waiver to continue mpox programming in the DRC, one had not been approved yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; officials have said their aim is to reduce wasteful spending and fraud, public health researchers criticized the speed and ferocity of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you’re gonna do these types of cuts, they have to be mindful,” said Amesh Adalja, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s this unpredictability that you can’t have if you’re trying to run a disease control program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When that’s pulled, Adalja explained, “making decisions about vaccine allocation, vaccine programs, testing strategies, is missing expert input, and that makes it harder for it makes it harder for control efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While much of the agency’s programming remains halted, the future of USAid continues to be challenged in court cases. One federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; last Thursday that the aid freeze must be temporarily halted and gave the government five days to comply. Aid workers said the ruling has created confusion on how to restart programs that may be simply axed again shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Though USAid employees said in interviews they are most concerned about finding ways to continue the agency’s aid work, the last several weeks have been personally taxing as well, according to court testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Three USAid workers described the chaos of being pulled from the Democratic Republic of Congo on 28 January as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing federal workers. After protests broke out in Kinshasa, the embassy issued an order to evacuate. But with foreign aid frozen, Washington offices closed and many colleagues placed on administrative leave, USAid employees had little communication and were forced to fund their own evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":22,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Trump disrupting US bird flu response as outbreak worsens","elementId":"4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-bird-flu-response"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Workers described being shuttled into boats with their families with just enough space to hold a carry-on bag each on their laps or a backpack – many leaving pets and most of their belongings behind.

The United States was the biggest donor of the WHO and also benefited from sharing research with other countries it will no longer be privy to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If we blindfold ourselves and tie our hands, we’re not going to make ourselves safer,” said Morse. “We will just be less aware of what’s killing us or what’s making us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE51bjBlSktDTVo2OVUtTjVmekpoaXdCa1BvLTF1emxnMU5GcjhQSWhnYUJyQjhlQUhrYjJfamQzVlNoalpKUFNPc2lzanYzYS1KUlhyZlR6azFoMUFYa0E3RFp0aF81akZMOUVISHlvajhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Americans Tell Us Why They're Drinking Less - Bon Appetit</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE81SmJpbEc0aVkyZGVhZWlYMDc5a3JUa3cyNGdtRzROQjNaODBhTHNnYmtnN1NiTENCd0JFeHVNNklsNjRhNWp4Z2tXUUc1aUNka0RHRlFBYlpMTUlNLTBORmFIcXlMOExERHQydA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are drinking alcohol less. For some, it’s never wanting to experience another hangover. For others, it’s a necessary sacrifice for their overall well-being. Whatever the reason, young Americans, ages 18–34, are focused on improving their health, according to a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996"}' href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coincides with a January 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf"&gt;advisory from the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt;, warning of a “casual link” between increased risk of seven types of cancer (including breast [in women], colorectal, esophagus, voice box, liver, mouth, and throat) and drinking, highlighting alcohol use as a “leading preventable cause of cancer…contributing to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 cancer deaths each year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report is just the latest in decades of warnings that alcohol is harmful to people’s health. But that may not the sole—or even primary—cause of &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nonalcoholic-bottle-shops-sober-curious-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;the substance’s downshift in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. Gallup reports that of the recent studies published concerning alcohol use and long-term health effects, “just 19% of US adults say they have heard ‘a great deal’ about such studies.” Thirty percent responded having heard “a fair amount,” while another 30% say they have “not heard much” and 21%, “nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bon Appétit spoke to people across the country to hear their thoughts. For many, their choice to imbibe, abstain, drink less, or enjoy booze-free alternatives is deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedWrapper-kULtsE iGAJsG content-card-embed content-card-embed--stacked" data-testid="ContentCardEmbedWrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedInfo-bDftKl bGnSrq"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="ContentCardEmbedDek" class="ContentCardEmbedDek-bA-DKch iuyVgm"&gt;While big box giants jump on the NA boom, mom-and-pop shops prioritize community with a personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natalie Pedraza, 24 (Monroe, LA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never drank before I went to college, and I was a bigger drinker then than I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like every other night, but since graduating, that’s died down a lot. Since moving to Northeast Louisiana, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; there is to do here is drink. It’s a small, Southern town—that’s what people do. I go to Wine Wednesdays, which wasn’t something I did when I first moved here, but it’s part of the culture. We’ll go out once, maybe twice a week drinking. A new restaurant, Apero, opened recently with a zero-proof gin and a mocktail list, but it’s not a regular thing here. If you’re not drinking alcohol here, you’re drinking Coke or Dr Pepper or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth disparity in Monroe is very large. For a lot of people, they’d rather spend $5 for a beer than $11 or $13 for something maybe better for you. It would be harder to find nonalcoholic alternatives here, to keep up with a [sober curious] lifestyle. I would have to go out of my way to do it. For me personally, the alternative is CBD or THC, but here there’s still a lot of stigma in the South around those. Alcohol is more socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do feel like everything nowadays causes cancer. [The surgeon general’s announcement] does make me rethink a lot of things. I’m thinking back to college and wondering how much I increased my risk, that does make me worried a little bit. But I also feel like, on social media for me, there are a lot of people that are health conscious on TikTok that make this information make sense a little bit more—especially with women. We’re targeted a little bit more. A lot of wellness is being thrown at you, partying is not trending as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alyssa Lucchesi, 34 (Madison, WI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/borg-gen-z-binge-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;Ever since being a very heavy drinker in college&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve lost interest.

This was the early ’00s, so no one batted an eye when I said I was on a diet. The body positivity movement hadn’t fully integrated with general society and we were expected to hate our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drew grids on printer paper and wrote out what I ate each day. One box for breakfast (nothing), one box for lunch (a rice cake), one box for dinner (carrot sticks). I was more concerned with not eating than I was with being skinny. Hunger was a proxy, a way to redirect bad feelings I didn’t know how to cope with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything could send me into a crash diet—lunchroom tension that put my already low social standing at risk. The classroom bully making fun of my socks. A tearful argument with my mom. My bouts of restriction were always preceded by a jittery, head-spinning buzz. I would later learn that this was a physical manifestation of anxiety, but all I knew at the time was that focusing on hunger helped alleviate my shaky nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each episode lasted a few days, a week at most. The bad feeling would fade, I’d become tired of feeling hungry, or my friends would start talking to me again. I never confronted my anxiety or developed skills to deal with my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the winter of my sophomore year of college, I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. If you’ve ever been a sophomore in college with a boyfriend who cheated on you, you are aware that this is the worst thing in the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dove headfirst into a full-blown eating disorder. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Instead of confronting the ravaged ache of my teenage heart, I turned to what had always been there: restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eating disorders can (and do) develop on the basis of body image, they are often adaptive, which means the person engages in those behaviors for reasons other than weight loss. Focusing on pain within my control—hunger via restriction—was my panicked attempt at reclaiming power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picture myself at 19, walking out of the daylight down a wooded pathway that rapidly closes in, becoming narrower and more twisted until I am so tangled in branches I can’t move forward or turn back. If I’d known that 17 years into the future, at the age of 36, I would be sitting hunched over to hide my stomach, cringing at mirrors, and sobbing at the sight of my body in a dress, maybe I would have done something differently. Maybe I would have dedicated more energy to therapy, found healthy ways to process, accepted that sometimes life feels hard and then you get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life. At 19 I couldn’t imagine I’d ever be on the other side, so I did nothing except starve myself. And for the first time, I lost weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, my refusal to eat flew under the radar. Restriction is aligned with diet culture, making it a fairly acceptable form of behavioral control, at least to a certain extent. Plus, you get a lot of positive reinforcement when you lose weight. So when I started seeing physical results, something flipped in my brain and an already unhealthy coping mechanism turned into something more insidious, like a nest of snakes cracking through shells, flicking their forked tongues in the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soft padding of flesh around my hips shrank, then vanished. My D-cup chest shriveled to a C, then a B. I stood in front of the mirror one morning, dizzy with hunger and awe, tracing a finger around my protruding collarbone. I raised my arms over my head and saw the shadowed curves of one, two, three ribs. If I stood at just the right angle, I could glimpse air between my thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this, restricting had been about being hungry. But with this rapid weight loss, the snakes uncoiled in my brain, coming to life in the success of measurable metrics. I went from never weighing myself to stepping on the scale a dozen times a day. The hunger cramps and lightheadedness were worth it, as long as the number continued to drop. It wasn’t easy though—I craved food from the moment I woke up to the moment I curled around my gnawing, empty stomach and tried to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common misconception about eating disorders is that the person doesn’t want to eat. That isn’t always true, and certainly not for me. I thought about food all the time. I stared at girls eating—not in disgust but in envy. Sharing pastries outside coffee shops, tearing open energy bar wrappers in the gym lobby. I walked through the dining hall with my tray of food substitutes—fat-free Cool Whip, iceberg lettuce doused in ketchup—trying not to gape as I passed a dining hall employee shaking salt over a tray of french fries and sliding a pan of cheeseburgers under the heat lamp. But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I developed strategies for keeping the hunger at bay, gnawing on bowls of air-popped popcorn and dry Fiber One cereal, mentally subtracting the fiber from the overall calories. I drank decaf instant coffee from morning until night, dumped packets of Splenda over bowls of slimy sugar-free JELL-O, did anything I could to create the illusion of flavor and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to my own rules for what (and when) I could eat became increasingly stressful. Whispers spread through my social group about my weight loss and bizarre habits, and I started going to the dining hall alone, sitting at a two-top against the wall so no one could see my disordered facsimile of a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain, which had always felt sharp, became confused and groggy. I felt trapped between sleep and wakefulness, unable to focus in class. I heard my sentences trail off through an echoing tunnel. I scanned my body obsessively every chance I got. I peered into the mirror to make sure I could still see the correct collarbone depth and angular bones jutting from behind my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my weight loss slowed—the body’s desperate bid to cling to calories—I doubled down on the rules that governed my life. No solid food until 12 p.m. After noon I could chew a piece of gum, and if I was about to pass out, I was allowed a bite of fat-free cottage cheese. In the evenings, I ate one green apple cut into 32 slices. I drank Diet Coke and instant coffee to fool my stomach into thinking it was full. I set impossible-to-reach standards of success that would finally let me be happy: a perfect day of restriction, a new and lower number on the scale. But the goal post kept moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late spring, all my waking hours revolved around not eating. I trailed behind my friends one evening, starving and exhausted as I pulled myself up the railing toward the student union building. It was late in the day and I had been “good,” following the rules without slipping up. This meant I’d had just half a cucumber, my allotted apple, and so much instant coffee my teeth were covered in fine silt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not waiting three hours for her to cross campus,” one of the girls snapped, tossing her flat-ironed hair over the collar of her North Face fleece. I paused and shoved a piece of gum in my mouth, trying to ease the sting of her words. The truth was, while being skinny was the most important part of my life, I was getting a little sick of feeling dull and starving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t eaten bread or butter or cookies or pasta or salad dressing in six months. I missed being able to walk up a flight of stairs. The thick wool around my brain was both maddening and alarming. &lt;em&gt;OK, &lt;/em&gt;I thought, watching my friends disappear into the building as I slowly ascended the steps. &lt;em&gt;Maybe it’s time to start eating again. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I carefully folded a slice of wheat bread around a dab of peanut butter: a sad, eating-disordered version of a sandwich. I saved it for that afternoon, feeling the weight of it in my pocket as I crossed campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled the sandwich out of my pocket when I arrived for my shift at the gym. But then I froze, unable to pick it up.&lt;em&gt; If I eat this sandwich, what next? Bagels? Pizza? Cake? Ice cream? All of this discipline and success for nothing? Who will I be if I’m not skinny?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panic flooded my chest. I pinched off a piece of bread and rolled it between my fingers until it became a spongy marble. The desk phone rang shrilly, echoing the ringing in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ignored the phone and stared at the sandwich. I tore it in half, then in half again. I shredded those four pieces until the sandwich lay scattered on the desk in 12 mutilated chunks. The phone rang again and I ignored it, my heart racing as I stared at the crumbled bread and peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My coworker hurried out of the back room balancing a pile of folders. He glared at me as he grabbed the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swept the sandwich into the garbage without taking a bite. My head swam from hunger, but something else, too: the dark seed of fear that I’d gone too far, the snakes embedded in every crevice of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating this sandwich should be my choice, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No? OK then, what now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somehow passed my finals and went home for the summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents were horrified when they saw me, a skeletal shadow of the daughter they’d dropped off after Christmas break. My mother immediately booked a slew of appointments with a nutritionist, a primary care physician, and a therapist. I was over 18, but my parents paid my college tuition and the appointments were nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slumped mutely in the backseat of the minivan, ignoring her as we rode elevators up and down columns of identical office buildings, feeling nothing except a dull flash of pride the first time I heard the word &lt;em&gt;anorexia &lt;/em&gt;in hushed tones. At least I’d succeeded at something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My summer at home was a nightmare for everyone. My family begged me to have dinner with them, my mom pinched and pleading and my younger siblings staring silently at their plates. My dad was more understanding. He had quietly fought his own battles with body image and restriction throughout my childhood, but he was still helpless seeing how far I’d plunged down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have the words to say how I wanted to join them, or explain why I couldn’t. I would have loved to go to the ice cream stand or yell out topping suggestions when we called for pizza. I wanted to pile my dad’s famous meatballs on a heaping mound of pasta and elbow my sister for the green shaker of powdered parmesan. But I hovered in the doorway like a ghoul of an eldest daughter, desperate to be near food and warmth but too scared to take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not hungry,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night in August, I did join them for ice cream. We’d driven to an event together and I was too woozy to walk back to the house alone. Or maybe that’s not true. Maybe I didn’t need a ride back, but I was tired of arguing about food. Maybe I wanted to pretend I was normal. Maybe I just wanted to eat some fucking ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was my turn to order, the bored high schooler in a pastel baseball cap hovered her pen over the ticket. I opened my mouth to order the tasteless, sugar-free frozen yogurt from the back of the case, covered in ice crystals from neglect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I have a large sundae, with mint chip, rocky road, sprinkles, and extra hot fudge?” I asked, my voice high-pitched and unfamiliar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later my order appeared in the window. A sloppy, overflowing bowl of ice cream with hot fudge dripping down the side and a maraschino cherry leaking electric red dye down the sagging pile of whipped cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I inhaled the sundae in a frantic, bug-eyed rush. My siblings pretended not to stare, but I could feel the tension drain as I ate. &lt;em&gt;She’s eating ice cream. Maybe she’s going to get better; maybe this is over. &lt;/em&gt;They chattered over each other as they dug into their cones, the rise and fall of  conversation a backdrop to the dopamine receptors firing so hard I could barely see straight. The taste of real food made me swoon: thick, creamy ice cream, crunchy sprinkles, gooey fudge hardened into sticky clumps. I scraped the bottom of the dish so hard I bent the plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colors of the outdoor patio felt saturated, like my vision was turned up to superhero level. My voice sounded like it was coming through a tunnel as I said: &lt;em&gt;be right back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little dairy hut had a one-stall private bathroom. And ice cream, as it turned out, was one of the easiest things to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever I’d been before—the on-and-off restriction, the full-blown anorexia, somewhere in between—bulimia was so much worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain purity in restriction, an ethereal perfection in refusing food. You are elevated, you don’t &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;like others do. In the hierarchy of eating disorders, anorexia is at the top. To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings. You are always doing something wrong (eating), then atoning for it (purging). It is a descent straight to hell and I was powerless to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I ate the ice cream, there was no going back. Every morning I woke up and prepared to battle my mind and body, begging the two to cooperate and not wind up in an out-of-control nighttime binge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d make it through most of the day, then fall apart at night. Soon there were multiple fugue-like binges each day. My electrolytes became so skewed I’d see stars when I stood up, and I built a mental map of single-stall campus bathrooms where I could jam my fingers down my throat until blood vessels burst in my eyes and the corners of my lips split apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost whatever remained of my brain power. My head was so fuzzy I’d set the shampoo outside of the shower door after I’d used it, then put the conditioner out afterwards. Otherwise I’d have no memory of what stage of hair washing I was at, repeating the lather and rinse so many times I’d start crying from confusion and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My world was reduced to fear, hunger, and shame. There was no self anymore. &lt;em&gt;I feel like everything is gray and I miss color&lt;/em&gt;, I scrawled in a barely legible journal entry, one of only a few coherent thoughts in a notebook filled with run-on sentences panicking about food and weight and sadness and self-loathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand (or even perhaps empathize with) the eating-disordered mind requires some suspension of disbelief. You have to accept that after a certain point, very little of it makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like a rat trapped in a maze with no finish, running into walls and getting electrocuted at every turn. I wanted out of the hellscape I’d created, but I had formed a whole identity around the latticework of visible bones and tendons; my days were structured around the denial of food. To give up the eating disorder meant losing the core of who I had become. If I lost control over the core of my being, it would mean I failed. If I failed . . . I didn’t have an answer for what happened after failure. It was too terrifying to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family lived within driving distance, and one night my mom dropped me back on campus after my sister’s birthday dinner. I’d swayed in a chair all night, shifting from side to side on my bony butt, spots dancing in front of my eyes as I tried to resist binging on ice cream cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom was quiet on the drive, but as we pulled up to my apartment building, she pushed a trifold pamphlet into my chapped hands. I tilted it toward the window, squinting at &lt;em&gt;Walden Center for Behavioral Health&lt;/em&gt; printed in black over a watercolor of two people walking a flower-lined path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is this?” I asked, pinching it between two fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a residential program,” she said. “A special program for eating disorders.” She flinched almost imperceptibly as the words hovered between us. I was prone to eruptions at any mention of doctors, therapy, or eating, so I can’t imagine the guts it took for her to hand me this pamphlet, how she must have felt on the drive to campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;talked &lt;/em&gt;to them?” I hissed, flinging the seatbelt so hard over my shoulder it hit the door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maggie,” she said, her voice shaking but measured. “You need help. We are terrified. Do it for your siblings, dad, myself. School, riding horses, running. Please, we miss you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m. Fine.” I could hear the low pitch of my voice building into simmering rage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She held her ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lunged out of the car, slamming the door as she sat with her hands curled around the steering wheel, staring at her lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, I pulled the pamphlet out of my desk drawer and called the number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the exact moment I called, or what made me do it. I told people that I’d fainted in the shower and hit my head hard enough to be scared for my life. I didn’t want to lie, but I felt the need to justify giving up the eating disorder. It wasn’t enough to just want my life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I did want my life back. Desperately. I felt like being dead would be better than continuing to exist. I weighed less than 100 pounds. It hurt to sit and to stand, my knuckles bled from scraping them against my teeth, and I nearly fainted every time I stood up. My friends couldn’t stand me, my family was scared of me, I couldn’t put together a full sentence, and I missed who I used to be as a person. That was it. Those were my reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked into Walden the day after Christmas of my junior year. I’d wound up following a not-uncommon trajectory: More than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684068/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;50 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with bulimia have a history of anorexia. The rigid restriction I’d put myself through was unsustainable in the long term, and like other patients, had led to binge eating and compensatory purging. By the time I dragged my floral duffel through the sliding doors of Walden, I fit the criteria for “restrictive bulimia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden Center had four units on the ground floor of a beautiful apartment building in eastern Massachusetts. Residents moved apartments as they progressed through the program, rewarded with less supervision and more privileges at each stage. I started in the first apartment, with open-door bathroom monitoring, no outside walks beside a brief daily dose of fresh air, and one slow, supervised yoga session every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden’s program was fairly standard for a residential facility. Along with weight restoration and interrupting eating disorder behaviors, treatment emphasized relearning how to have a normal relationship with food. With supervision, we made shopping lists and cooked our own meals. It was a far cry from the trays of hospital food I’d imagined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each resident had their own daily requirements, which included portions of grains, proteins, fats, fruits, and vegetables. There were no mentions of calories, just a list of foods under each category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of grains alone contained a cornucopia of illegal food: oatmeal, bagels, english muffins, bread, cereal, granola bars. Proteins were even more thrilling: Greek yogurt, string cheese, cream cheese, bacon, hamburgers, beans. Foods I hadn’t eaten outside of hollow-eyed, guilt-ridden binges in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I settled in quickly, determined to learn the rules and do everything well. Each week we huddled around Stop &amp;amp; Shop delivery forms, consulting each other as a counselor sat at the table with one ear tuned to the conversation. We had to create a weekly grocery list that would stock the pantry for our meals. It was a simple task that stretched our brains to their limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stared at the list of food, moving a stubby pencil between rice, honey, half and half, chicken. &lt;em&gt;What does a normal meal look like? &lt;/em&gt;It doesn’t look like stewed tomatoes eaten from the can, but it also doesn’t look like a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, a bag of Goldfish, four bowls of Frosted Flakes, and half a jar of hot fudge followed by 30 minutes in the bathroom turning my stomach inside out before collapsing with a tear-streaked cheek pressed to the tile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three times per day, each apartment’s residents gathered in the kitchens to make meals that fulfilled our requirements. Emotions ran high and the counselors were present to both calm us and approve our choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I need three grains, two proteins, a vegetable, and two fats for dinner, this could mean a baked potato, a hamburger on a bun, a side of baked beans, and two servings of butter on the potato. Once I explained the meal to the counselor and showed them each measured component as I added it to my plate, they’d jot their initials next to my name and I could take a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully fulfilled my meal requirements. I held my arm out for blood pressure and vitals checks each morning and night and was weighed on a blind scale every other day. I participated in nutrition classes, suffered through weekly family therapy, and shoved my clothes into my bag every 10 days as I moved to the next apartment. The second apartment had closed-door bathroom privileges, the third had a longer outdoor walk each day. It was progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d all voluntarily checked in, but we clung to shreds of control where we could. One of my roommates did push-ups in the bathroom. We lifted food packages surreptitiously to the light, trying to find an angle that allowed us to see the Sharpied-over nutrition facts. I circled the fountain on supervised walks, chatting with another girl who had also been a runner. A counselor always called us back, clocking the attempt at exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still hesitated at the table, under-measured the butter for my mashed potatoes, filled the measuring cup with water and a splash of milk for opacity before turning to the counselor to check off my protein category. I still nodded slightly when one of the girls, wearing compression socks for edema, gave a tiny head shake as I reached for the refried beans for my protein one night. I drifted my hand toward the black beans: lower calories and fat. She nodded just perceptibly before going back to preparing her own meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tiring push-pull, releasing the hold of a psychiatric disorder. But other than the occasional miserable family therapy session or rapidly corrected eating disorder behaviors, the program was calm and quiet. None of us had much energy, and the emotional toll of weight gain kept us low-key. The days blended together, the passage of time marked by each meal or completing another 1,000-piece puzzle. The misery of restriction, the monstrous feeling of a binge, the desperation of a purge—they were all replaced by new emotions. There was the minor frustration of a tangled, lumpy knitting project, the glee at placing the final jigsaw puzzle piece, the spark of pride during a joyful moment in group therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Walden after four weeks, having regained enough weight to medically stabilize. I had a plan for outpatient counseling and dietitian checkups, and my own set of measuring cups so I could continue my restoration plan at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drove myself to my nutrition appointments between classes and horseback riding at the university stable, and I started running again, relishing the clear-headed energy and swell of muscle in my quads. I slipped up here and there, but within two years of leaving Walden, I was declared recovered. There were no rampant eating-disordered behaviors and the number on the scale stayed within a reasonable range. The coil of snakes lay dormant, and as far as I and my medical team were concerned, we’d eradicated them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was good for a time. I moved out west after graduating, and I devoted my next decade to a newfound love of the outdoors. My social life revolved around activity: I was a strong climber, a capable mountain biker, and I backpacked at a punishing pace, covering hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain alone and unafraid. None of these elements would have been possible without a strong body, and because I was so fit, I effortlessly maintained that lean strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no fear of food or body shame during those years. But the shadow was still somewhere in my brain, the coiled snakes stilled by my multi-sport fitness and high mileage in the mountains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I see my eating disorder still showed up in sneaky ways. I joked about how I didn’t enjoy cooking, fielded comments about the speed at which I ate, and attributed the fact that I cleaned the kitchen completely before eating to being tidy. In reality, I still associated food with guilt. I ate fast to get it over with and remove any evidence I had made food. Additionally, my high level of activity meant I was constantly trading calories back and forth in my mind, a background abacus with the beads click-clacking back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I thought my eating disorder would stay quiet forever, I was wrong. A few years ago, the combination of a naturally slowing metabolism and pandemic-induced lifestyle change altered my body. My pants stopped buttoning smoothly, my outline softened. I couldn’t tell you exactly what was different, but I knew something had changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I was confused. I opened a slew of tabs on my phone, scrolling through piles of unhelpful SEO clickbait. Was seltzer making me bloated? Was I biking too much and not running enough? The dormant shadow, the coil of snakes in my brain woke up, stretched, shook themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started obsessing over my body in a way I hadn’t since college. I avoided mirrors, kept the lights off in the bathroom, and wrapped a towel around my body before stepping out of the shower. I went from wearing dresses, skirts, crop tops, and matching workout sets to baggy shirts and high-rise leggings with wide elastic waistbands. I stood slightly bent over and pushed my hands into my pockets to hold my clothes out from my body, walking down the street like a polyester circus tent. It didn’t help that the body positivity trends of the past several years seemed to have vanished in the blink of an algorithm, and suddenly I was being spoon-fed a steady stream of thin-is-in videos that sent me reeling back to the magazine covers of my college years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body dysmorphia flared as fast and hot as my eating disorder had 15 years before. The all-consuming thoughts stretched back to my 19-year-old self, sobbing on the floor, vowing never to eat again after being cheated on. Now, here I was in my mid-30s, my brain short-circuiting on a trip to Europe because there were too many store-window reflections, I’d packed the wrong clothes, and the restaurants made me feel full. I spent an hour-long bus ride deleting every photo of myself where my arms were visible, my thighs were touching, and the outline of my stomach showed through my shirt. I pulled away from my boyfriend and stared at the floor in the claustrophobic elevators, the mirrored walls a reflective torment. Everywhere I looked, there I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broke down in my therapist’s office when I returned, gesturing at my body as I grasped for a pillow to hold over my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look at me,” I sobbed, “what’s happening to my body?” My brain writhed, hot, like a rock had been pushed aside to release the pit of vipers. My therapist was quiet for a moment, letting my words echo in the small office. She passed me a box of tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what we’re looking at is body dysmorphia,” she said. I hiccuped and shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, “I know what I look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t know what I looked like, I still don’t. Present tense. The unfortunate truth of eating disorders is that no matter how “recovered” you feel, act, and look, there are some elements that might never go away. Body dysmorphia is the last thing to go, if it ever does. To be trapped in this mind is like revisiting the most potent mental and emotional elements of the eating disorder without the physical symptoms and behaviors. And it’s all inward facing—I do not judge bodies of different shapes and sizes. This cruelty is solely reserved for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet sands down the edges of body dysmorphic disorder. Except for the most severe cases (in which people might undergo cosmetic surgery), search results tell you that someone with body dysmorphia might avoid mirrors, or perhaps compare how they look to other people. It sounds like someone having a bad hair day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surface-level explainers don’t reveal what it’s like to &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt; in that brain. To be unable to concentrate because of your waistband rolled down, to have your day ruined by the wrong angle in the wrong mirror, to leave your partner alone on the couch because oops, you remembered that you have a body and that they might touch it. As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand how stunningly stupid it is to spend this much time thinking about the softness of my stomach or the width of my arms. Throw a dart anywhere on a map and you’ll find someone having a worse day, week, month, or life than me. But I cannot convince my disordered brain this battle is not worth fighting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They weighed me at the doctor’s office in 2008 and declared me recovered, but in reality, eating disorder researchers cannot agree on how to define true recovery. It’s easy to measure “healthy” weight with simple metrics to determine medical stability. It’s somewhat harder—but still relatively straightforward—to determine whether the person is engaging in eating disorder behaviors. Severe restriction? Binging and purging? Creating “meals” with foods that should not be combined? That’s all pretty obvious. But what about panic at the sight of mirrors, distress at the cling of clothing? Eating so fast you almost choke because you need to get it over with? Spiraling because your sleeves felt tight? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based psychotherapist Erika Bent is a certified eating disorder specialist supervisor. She studied anorexia as a researcher before transitioning to clinical and residential work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The psychology that you’re describing is harder to measure,” Bent tells me as I describe limiting my access to mirrors and leaving the lights off lest I catch a glimpse of my reflection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body image distress is one of the last things to be resolved in eating disorder recovery,” she says, adding that this is such a standard experience for people with a history of eating disorders that it even has a name: “normative discontent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel better in that I’m not alone. I feel worse in that this might be how my brain works forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fall morning, I scan the address numbers above a sidewalk I’ve walked every week for years, following the blue dot on my phone screen to a door I’ve never noticed. The Eating Disorder Center of Montana has two locations, and this one is right off the main road on a busy side street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself anxiously rehearsing my introduction as I climb the stairs, even though I’ve already told Lauren Stille, the lead dietitian, that I’m here as a journalist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of literature but not a lot of consensus about long-term recovery, and I have many questions. I’m so trapped in my head I’m secretly hoping she’s going to give me some good news: Body dysmorphia has a timeline, that I will soon wear the dozens of outfits in my closet and not the same (safe) pair of baggy sweatpants-and-sweatshirt combo. That I can move on after eating a large meal and not dissolve into hysterics because I feel full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dysmorphia is a terrible, crippling thing,” Stille says. She is relaxed in a leather chair while I’m hunched on the couch across from her, leaning forward to hide my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reiterate throughout the conversation that I’m only here for this essay, but she’s a therapist and an expert in the field of eating disorders. She knows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing [body dysmorphia] become more and more common,” she continues, telling me that it can escalate by how often the media draws attention to our bodies, insisting everything can be improved and modified. “You don’t like something about yourself? You can fix it and that’s the ticket to happiness.” I circle back to my eating-disordered thoughts from 15 years ago. &lt;em&gt;If I just have a perfect restriction day, if I just reach this new number on the scale. Then I’ll feel good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells me what I already know: Recovery is complicated. And these days, they’re trying to emphasize that there is no straightforward way to say &lt;em&gt;I’m recovered. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s more that ‘my eating disorder is currently quieter,’” Stille says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Your entire future is about continuing that work of recovery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh god,” I say, tapping the recorder to check the time, but really to avoid eye contact. “That is grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s little data on the mental and emotional outcomes in long-term eating disorder recovery, especially past the 10-year mark. One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883487/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;22-year study&lt;/a&gt; describes a shift in the therapeutic approach. Rather than treating for strict recovery guidelines, treatment should match a patient’s goals, which might not look like traditional recovery. This is a start, and helps encourage the idea that success doesn’t always operate on a binary. If anything, this could help minimize treatment and counseling dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the long-term studies that do exist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eat.20443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mostly follow patients&lt;/a&gt; with the resources to be in treatment, or to get diagnosed in the first place. Everything from clinical therapy to inpatient treatment is expensive and exclusive. To even begin untangling the process requires understanding complex medical systems and insurance providers. I had the privilege of my family’s health insurance, but people in less advantaged circumstances don’t have the same resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until my body dysmorphia spiked in the last two years, I rarely thought about my oddly fast eating habits or that I was subconsciously using exercise as a projection for feeling good about my body. It’s pretty crushing to learn that this might be the way my brain works for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does, however, make me feel marginally better to learn that some elements might not have been within my control. While the cultural fixation on thinness is an important and disturbingly prevalent factor in the development of eating disorders, only a minimal percentage of people are affected to the extent I was. Given that so many people are exposed to the same cultural messaging, why aren’t more people affected to the same degree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics seem to play an increasingly large role, and research is starting to indicate that some people may have a latent vulnerability to eating disorders, similar to alcoholism. These tendencies might never be “turned on” without the right combination of environmental factors, but that genetic potential—plus a high instance of comorbidity with anxiety—created the perfect petri dish for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain should be full of wonder and gratitude for my life: joy at finally keeping my houseplants alive, excitement as I plan next season’s travels, pride after finishing another rugged backcountry trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I plan trips around whether or not I’ll have to wear a bathing suit. I fling clothes onto the floor in a heap if they fit the wrong way. I crumple to the ground because my stomach touches my overalls in a way it didn’t last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I traveled to the desert this fall to help connect shuttles and food caches during a five-day backcountry trip. My partner and I led the group through sandstone arches, slot canyons, and desert oases most people will never see. I carried 60 pounds of supplies on my back and hiked alone into the canyon to set the cache, quads and glutes and back and shoulders moving fast over miles of cracked mud flats under a punishing sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was proud of my strong, capable, dust-caked body in the Southern Utah backcountry. I am tough on the trails where I’ve found my footing over the past decade. I’ve seen places on this planet I could have never imagined as I stared out the window of Walden Center that winter 15 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pride is conditional, and I can’t predict when the switch will flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in town I shed my reeking layers in a dingy Motel 6. The flickering bulb cast a sickly fluorescent light on my stomach, thighs, and arms. My body—which felt so powerful climbing out of the canyon just hours before—was reduced to a slab of pale, dimpled flesh, the &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; picture on a social media slideshow or 2006 diet-ad billboard. All I did was flick the light on, and my joy from the desert dissolved in the reality of being myself, chained to the dregs of a decades-long eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shame and disgust at my body turned to tears as the water ran gritty and brown down my filthy legs. I stare at the rust around the drain and think: &lt;em&gt;Someone, please, get me out of my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels painfully indulgent to have had an eating disorder, even more so to still be held captive by it. To have had all the privilege and food in the world, yet spend untold hours thinking about the imperfections of a body that has tried so hard to be good for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about the elements that make up a life, will any of my accomplishments include skipping dessert? Do I get an award for having a salad instead of a burger? I will never be remembered for the two years I had a thigh gap or that I dragged myself to the gym 100 days in a row. Saying no to food didn’t make my problems go away, it replaced them with other problems—when I came through the other side, the original problems were still there. If I’d known what this would have looked like in the future, would I have tried harder at 19 to avoid it? Would I even have been able to? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, more than 15 years after being declared recovered, I can tell you that sometimes there’s no tidy, closed loop with a psychiatric disorder. And that talking about it in the present tense can be the most realistic way to address it. For now, my hope is that someday I can return from the desert or the mountains, turn on the bathroom light, glance at my body in the mirror, and just say &lt;em&gt;thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maggie Slepian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a full-time writer based in Montana.

It is also produced within the body's cells when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight hit the skin, triggering vitamin D synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the source, though, vitamin D must be activated within the body—first through the liver, which converts vitamin D to calcidiol, and then in the kidney, which forms what's known as calcitriol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once activated, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut, prevents muscle cramps and spasms, and leads to healthy bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D also plays a role in reducing inflammation, immune function, and glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does vitamin D give you energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of research backs the idea that vitamin D may help put some pep in your step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207540/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the results of two groups with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency—one of which was given vitamin D supplements, the other a placebo. In just four weeks, the group given vitamin D experienced significant improvements in energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a small &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2013/04/vitamindproventoboostenergyfromwithinthecells.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study out of the U.K.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study out of the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; found vitamin D vital for making our muscles work efficiently and boosting energy levels.

It’s important to identify the underlying cause accurately to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts caution that a supplement is unlikely to help if you're not deficient in a nutrient. Still, notes a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/supplements-a-scorecard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s very hard to get the vitamin D you need from your diet; oily fish and fortified dairy products are the only important sources."

So supplements likely make sense for most adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vitamin D supplements are determined to be appropriate, exercise caution when making your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be wary of supplements that are far cheaper than the rest or look like a good deal,” &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jolene Brighten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jolene Brighten&lt;/a&gt;, naturopathic endocrinologist and author of &lt;em&gt;Is This Normal?&lt;/em&gt;, previously &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/best-supplements-boost-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt; “Often these are using poor quality ingredients, and in some cases … they won’t actually have what the label lists.” (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates supplements, but doesn't approve them for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers may want to consult the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements];elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements]&lt;/a&gt; as well as subscription-based sources, such as &lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Consumer Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Consumer Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which looks into issues ranging from possible contaminants to making sure a supplement contains what it claims to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommended daily intake for adults up to age 70 is 600 IU and 800 IU for adults over 70, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. Brighten adds, "It is also important to be getting enough sunlight.” She also underscores the importance of testing D levels to help determine what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't overdo it on supplements, caution experts.

In a delightful twist on a classic dinner date, an orange cat named Ginger has captured the hearts of viewers after a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFn2UpSyIQm/?igsh=MWpocnh3NXl1ajU2Mg==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; featuring her waiting patiently for her date at a candle-lit table went viral on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cat waits patiently at a dinner date in viral video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Instagram video — shared by user @heyitsgingerandpepper — captures Ginger as she sits poised at a miniature table adorned with red roses, flickering candles, and even a bottle of Champagne. The setting, complete with rose petals scattered on the floor, sets the perfect scene for a romantic rendezvous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger’s owner, Kim, humorously explained to &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ginger-cat-sat-candle-lit-table-ready-her-date-waiting-you-1777552" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; that the feline decided to mimic her “hoomans” by organizing a date night of her own. The feline feast featured cat wine and chicken cat food, followed by a cozy cuddle session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video’s charm has not gone unnoticed. It has quickly become a sensation among cat lovers on Instagram, amassing over 3 million likes and 7,480 comments as of Thursday. Comments from users express admiration for the cat’s demeanor and the overall scene. One user wrote, “Who would need a man when you have Ginger.” Another said, “Cutest Valentine!!!! Whomever spends Valentine’s Day with this cutie tomorrow, is one LUCKY individual!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters also speculated about Ginger’s intentions, with one predicting a proposal and another joking that they’d rather be on this date than any they could find on dating apps. Others were moved by the cat’s apparent happiness and cuteness, suggesting they’d arrive “2 hours early just to have extra time” with Ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that cats do form attachments similar to those seen between children and their parents, which perhaps explains why so many people find such joy in Ginger’s video. Despite their &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/features/50660-are-cats-domesticated-science" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:independent nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;independent nature&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown that cats feel comforted by their owners’ presence and can even experience distress when separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/news/59928-video-cat-waiting-for-date-viral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://cattime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CatTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CatTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:54:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSlRDai1GQ2pVaVRKeHVpLTJHUjdERHhKdFM1UXVyT3U5MUI1TWsxV015S05ya25jVmRlcG9uMi1XVFM4Q1UzaU9BZ1A4QzE5dUMtaGNTT3o1Qi1QdkFSWVpURU5laG5BZ0U5aURYN3lVY3VDaVJhejBDbFltTTY3VTVfZw</guid></item><item><title>This Painful Syndrome Is Sending Cannabis Users to the ER – Are You at Risk?

			&lt;p&gt;Disposable plastic containers could be leaching dangerous chemicals into your takeaway food, potentially increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on rats, researchers in China have found evidence that drinking water exposed to the various chemical additives that seep from heated plastic packaging causes changes to the body, that begin with altered gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodents that ingested this cocktail of plastic contaminants for just three months showed broken or misaligned fibers, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mitochondrial swelling in their heart tissue. They also showed bleeding between myocardial cells, as marked by the black pentagrams in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Health" class="size-medium wp-image-152637" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-490x415.jpg 490w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-768x650.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-1536x1300.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-2048x1734.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heart tissue of rodents in group A, B, C, and D, with D being the control group. The black arrow represents inflammatory cell infiltration, and the black pentagram represents intercardiomyocyte bleeding. (Wu et al., &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the same occurs in the human body is unknown, but the findings suggest that heated plastic containers may not be a safe vehicle for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wait for more research, the authors of the study at Ningxia Medical University in China &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, "It is essential to avoid using plastic containers for high-temperature food".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments on rats were prompted by a survey of 3,179 older adults in China. Those who reported higher exposure to plastic on a questionnaire were more likely to suffer congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-blood-clots-in-heart-brain-and-legs"&gt;concerning research&lt;/a&gt; has found microplastics accumulating in blood clots within the human brain, heart, and legs, so epidemiologist Yueping Wu and their colleagues decided to investigate the cardiovascular effects further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three months, they fed 24 rodents the chemicals that are leached from plastic containers when they are heated by boiling tap water, which include compounds such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;BPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-shocked-at-daily-level-of-plasticizers-in-californias-air"&gt;plasticizers&lt;/a&gt;. These 'leachates' were produced by placing plastic containers in hot tap water for durations of 1, 5, and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, rodents that drank the contaminated water had an altered intestinal microenvironment compared to the eight control rodents that did not. Their gut microbiomes had altered significantly after exposure to plastic and its chemicals, including changes to flora associated with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood of these exposed animals also showed a spike in inflammatory immune messengers, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes might be linked to plastic product leachates disrupting microbiota and inflammatory factors, which then trigger inflammation and myocardial damage," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Tissue " class="size-medium wp-image-152639" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-726x415.jpg 726w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-600x343.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Myocardial tissue of rats exposed to plastic contaminants.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that microwaving plastic food containers can release microplastics and nanoplastics into the meal, even if the containers claim to be microwave-safe. As few as three minutes can release billions of tiny plastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg" alt="Microwave Plastic" class="size-full wp-image-152625" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic-600x186.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microwaving releases microplastics.

It's also a mystery as to how long the fragments stick around for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-in-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; on clogged arteries in human patients have found tiny fragments of plastic accumulating in more than 50 percent of plaques. Within roughly 34 months of surgery, those with plastics in their arteries were 4.5 times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those where no plastic was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the body is exposed to plastic contaminants, researchers suspect there's a chance the additives can reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes and trigger the body's inflammatory reaction, leaving it exposed to cardiovascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png" alt="Plastics Microscopy" class="size-medium wp-image-152629" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-898x415.png 898w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-768x355.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-600x277.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy.png 1286w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jagged plastic particles were seen inside macrophages and deposits of fatty tissue, removed from clogged arteries.

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132800"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;, scientists discovered that when people put hot, disposable plastic cutlery in their mouths, it reduces their diversity of intestinal microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you order takeaway, you might want to think about the heat of the food and the material of the packaging it might come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It means eating lots of saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol, registered dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The patient said he lost weight, had more energy and experienced improved mental clarity, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828915" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:case report in JAMA Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;case report in JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;.

Once they appear, they generally don’t go away, but can be removed by a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In this patient’s case, the bumps indicated “an amazing amount of cholesterol in his bloodstream,” the cardiologist notes.

The lack of carbohydrates forces the body to burn fat for energy rather than glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other benefits include eliminating sugar, refined grains and ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes, Kirkpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The carnivore diet provides nutrients including riboflavin, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, selenium and vitamin A; but it falls short on magnesium, calcium, vitamin C and fiber, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722875/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People can experience nutrient deficiencies because they're cutting out plant-based foods, which are high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, Kirkpatrick notes. Not eating enough vegetables can lead to poor gut health and constipation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, patients who follow such extreme diets are at much higher risk of having abnormal cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Jeremy London, a Georgia heart surgeon who was not involved in the case report, says the carnivore diet may work for some, but most people will be healthiest when eating a balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our bodies are made to run on proteins, fats and carbohydrates,” London tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Anything in the extreme is rarely going to be beneficial. … In general, if you are focusing on whole foods where you’re eating lean meats, leafy greens, vegetables and fruits and fiber, you’re going to do fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is the healthiest, both doctors say, pointing to studies that show benefits for the heart and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are still interested in following the carnivore diet should keep an eye on their cholesterol profile with blood work and consult with a dietitian or a physician who can monitor the effects of eating only animal products, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-cholesterol-hands-rcna192565" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 02:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQZnlVczg5RGNHYi1mNXQzaVdoV2NEZWE4WTU3em1XdkF0dU0xeG1YaG1vTGxyT3hBUUFrd3kxSlVzaVVaNTItX1dSSEh4M0xKOW5IRksxMWFFdHB3M3JyV3o5R01YWmtSdjdaZExKbTd1SkxPS293SEpKdDQ4d2doWksxbnREQQ</guid></item><item><title>Silent garden killer claims four lives in 'unprecedented' Aussie outbreak - Yahoo News Australia</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNM19sUy04aGFPempkVDBNaWR3OERfUHhxNGZmVi1pamxmNGFfdm5ySkgxT1lXNVlETV90bzZ2ajR4dWQzUUpCam5JSFBOajVpdElZdHBXdUxIR2RyNGJxNV9xOWpQMnFmMUJtUmtoVXVLaUMyd1k5WnkzcGFvRWlTbFhwNUtPQ1ZsQUdkclhReENmSkVjaDdIRk1fMGliYjlUZV9zc0NpSXRCenU1X180MGdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING — GRAPHIC IMAGES: &lt;/strong&gt;An Aussie city is grappling with an “unprecedented” number of residents contracting a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/silent-garden-killer-puts-aussies-on-high-alert-after-claiming-five-lives-065107584.html" data-ylk="slk:silent yet potentially fatal disease;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;silent yet potentially fatal disease&lt;/a&gt; that has claimed the lives of four people this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since January, 41 cases of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/aussie-dads-warning-after-invisible-killer-pops-up-during-garden-renovation-three-people-died-073327313.html" data-ylk="slk:melioidosis;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;melioidosis&lt;/a&gt; — a serious illness caused by bacteria found lurking in tropical North Australian &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/gardens/" data-ylk="slk:soils;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;soils&lt;/a&gt; and water — have been recorded in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/" data-ylk="slk:Cairns;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding hinterland region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/health/" data-ylk="slk:health;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; authorities revealed last week that an investigation was underway after two people had tragically died from the disease, which is commonly associated with heavy rainfall events.

However, the most serious cases, which can lead to pneumonia and sepsis, occur during severe weather events when people breathe it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mark was forced to have a toe on each foot and part of a finger amputated.

Then the water just takes the organism wherever the course can lead and when we get floods, and those get breached, then the organism gets seeded into the environment more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that environment is suitable for the organism to replicate in, it will effectively get planted there and then potentially establish a new focus, which could increase threat to humans in places that it wasn’t previously known to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;How to protect yourself from contracting melioidosis.

The team is also recruiting past or current patients and their families so they can study their immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we do all of those things, we’re going to develop risk assessment maps for North Queensland,” he added. They will include areas where people are not yet residing but may move in the future, and will aid &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/councils/" data-ylk="slk:councils;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;councils&lt;/a&gt; when they consider approving new housing developments or road works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This ultimately is going to hopefully help us predict where it currently is and where the disease might be…and therefore the relative risk of people acquiring the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have contracted melioidosis and want to participate in Warner’s grant project, you can contact him at Jeffrey.warner@jcu.edu.au.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a story tip?

Tragically, he lost both his mother and brother shortly after birth. Left all alone, the tiny lamb was rejected by the other ewes on the farm, leaving everyone devastated, fearing he wouldn’t survive on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That is until his savior came in the form of a sweet Yellow Labrador dog named Digby, who accepted the little lamb and has been helping to care for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The beautiful video was uploaded to the TikTok account for @Harryemmel, and everyone is so touched that the Yellow Labrador dog named Digby stepped up to care for little Simon, the lamb, when no other creature would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One person commented, "You’re telling me the cutest creature to ever exist was rejected?

Everyone needs a Digby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The adorable clip shows Digby leading a flock of ducklings around the farm, patting some small turkeys on the head, running around with some beautiful horses, hanging out with some chickens, a dog, some goats and even a turtle!

		&lt;p&gt;EVERETT — Influenza has killed 15 people across Snohomish County during the latest respiratory virus season, the county health department announced on Wednesday, making the 2024-2025 flu season the deadliest in three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu activity is “concerning,” the Snohomish County Health Department said in a release, especially for older people or those with underlying health conditions. In Janurary, the department announced that the flu had killed two people in the county. The 2023-2024 flu season killed 10 people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen of the people killed by the flu this season were over 50 years old, the department said. One was between 35 and 49 and another was between 20 and 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 7% of emergency department visits in the past week were related to flu symptoms, the county said. It’s a decrease from the two weeks prior, where flu-related emergency visits hovered around 8%, but still significantly higher than last year’s numbers. Last year peaked at 4%, the department said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, 44 people in the county were hospitalized for flu-related illnesses. Last year’s peak was only 13 people. Between 2022 and 2023, the peak was 24 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-34-47221513" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-34-47221513" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“After the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw alarmingly high levels of flu activity in 2022-2023. Now, we are witnessing similar, if not greater, levels of viral transmission. This serves as a clear reminder that everyone in our community should take proactive steps to prevent the spread of illness,” said the Health Officer at the Snohomish County Health Department, James Lewis, in a press release. “One of the most effective measures is vaccination.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are recommended for everybody six months and older. Vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccinesafety.htm" target="_blank"&gt;which research has proven to be extremely safe&lt;/a&gt;, can help prevent severe illness or complications from the flu.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county health department also recommends masking when sick and staying home if you get the flu. People who get the flu should not return to school or work until it has been more than 24 hours since they had a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-35-29963866" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-35-29963866" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the number of people who were killed by the flu during the 2023-2024 season. Ten people died, not seven. It has also been updated to clarify a season peak of 4% of flu-related emergency room visits in the 2023-2024 season.&lt;/em&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The humble mushroom is a fungi with plenty of potential. Previous research has shown mushrooms can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-locate-a-link-between-eating-mushrooms-and-a-lower-risk-of-depression"&gt;reduce depression risk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mushroom-extract-shown-to-dramatically-improve-brain-cell-growth-in-the-lab"&gt;improve brain cell growth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mushroom-extract-shows-promising-effects-against-prostate-cancer"&gt;guard against cancer&lt;/a&gt; – and a new study shows they may protect against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="152480" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from McGill University in Canada found that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan fibers&lt;/a&gt; found in all types of mushrooms could act as a sort of barrier to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="152480" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, limiting inflammation in the lungs of mice exposed to infection after a dose of beta-glucan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the mice given the fibers showed improved lung function and a lower risk of serious illness and death when hit with the flu. Human trials will tell us more, but this is already a promising avenue for researchers to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152483" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152483" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans.jpg" alt="Lung scans" class="wp-image-152483 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans-600x346.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152483" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mice given beta-glucan showed less lung damage from flu infections. (Khan et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta-glucan is found in the cell walls of all fungi, including some that live in and on our bodies as part of the human microbiome," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Maziar Divangahi, immunologist at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is tempting to hypothesize that the levels and composition of fungi in an individual could influence how their immune system responds to infections, in part because of beta-glucan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta-glucan is already known to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30587-8"&gt;boost immunity&lt;/a&gt;, but here the researchers wanted to test its capabilities in terms of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerance_to_infections"&gt;disease tolerance&lt;/a&gt; – essentially reducing the impact of the viral attack on the body, rather than killing off the attacking pathogens, as conventional antiviral treatments do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes beta-glucan even more special is that it seems to reprogram immune cells to better cope against the flu. Treated mice had more immune cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil"&gt;neutrophils&lt;/a&gt;, but they were behaving in a more controlled manner than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that reprogramming was crucial, limiting the risk of neutrophils going into overdrive to fight off infection – and leading to the lung inflammation that so often causes complications and serious health issues (like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;) after a flu infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neutrophils are traditionally known for causing inflammation, but beta-glucan has the ability to shift their role to reduce it," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Kim Tran, from McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smarter, savvier neutrophils stuck around for up to a month as well, hinting that a treatment based on beta-glucan could offer long-lasting protection – though we're still in the very early stages of understanding its potential in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know the benefits of disease tolerance – and how it can save lives – there's a lot we don't know about how it works behind the scenes. This research adds a host of useful insights, and could well be applied to other similar &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/still-short-of-breath-here-are-3-ways-covid-19-can-damage-lungs-long-term"&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/a&gt; in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is remarkable how beta-glucan can reprogram certain immune cells, such as neutrophils, to control excessive inflammation in the lung," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Nargis Khan, who is now at the University of Calgary in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-024-02041-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They're her favorite snack in the whole world. But when Mom takes the excited girl to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; drive-thru where pup cups don't exist, Chloe's epic meltdown ensues, and it's like a toddler who didn't get her way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fact that dogs not only know when you're pulling up to their spot but also come to expect a tasty treat every time they get into the car is diabolical.

Watch as Chloe gives the sobfest of a lifetime over this drive-thru mix-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mom Grace Marie (@geemariee__) is probably used to these little tantrums by now, and based on other clips (like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@geemariee__/video/7042739130509315334" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this one;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), Chloe's a big fan of barking what's on her mind. She may be small, but she has a lot to say when it comes to her beloved whipped topping treat. Her little whimper, complete with a dramatic huffing and puffing, is adorable!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This video blew up fast with thousands of people begging that Mom take this poor &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/tag/pugs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt; baby for a Starbies run STAT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Go and get that dog a pup cup now!" one person wrote. "Go to Starbucks and give her that pup cup NOW!" another added, and many more comments stated the same with the majority petitioning "Justice for Chloe!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though the suspense was high, everyone who became invested in the Pug's pup cup status will be relieved to know Mom did take her after the fact.

It's everything a pup could want: sweet, cold, flavorful and most of all—it's not an everyday thing so getting one makes them feel a little more special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Sploot Veterinary Care, &lt;a href="https://www.splootvets.com/post/whats-in-a-pup-cup-famous-pup-cups" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pup cups are fine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pup cups are fine&lt;/a&gt; in moderation and in conjunction with an already healthy diet. Just like with humans, this high-sugar snack should be consumed once in awhile and not an every day event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But that's what makes the lightly flavored whipped topping so exciting! And, though it's not officially a menu iten, in most locations it's free, making it splurge-worthy without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And obviously, if your dog has a sensitive stomach, this wouldn't be the best option. Frozen fruit or a little peanut butter in a Kong would be just as yummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though Starbucks is known for crafting the OG "Puppuccino," many places offer something similar, whether it's a little whipped cream in a cup or even vanilla ice cream. Based on Chloe's utter devastation after realizing she wasn't in line for her coveted treat, pup cups are king.

So we have to assume — based on the history of this patient — that those lesions were directly caused by the high cholesterol, which was directly caused by the type of diet that he was (eating).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The patient developed yellow lumps in the creases of his palms — deposits of excess cholesterol under his skin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For eight months, the man had been following the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-meal-plan-rcna127366" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carnivore diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carnivore diet&lt;/a&gt; — a high-protein, no-carb plan that focuses on eating only animal products, especially meat, eggs and some dairy; and excludes fruits, vegetables and grains. It means eating lots of saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol, registered dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient said he lost weight, had more energy and experienced improved mental clarity, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828915" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:case report in JAMA Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;case report in JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;. But his primary care doctor noticed the fatty yellow bumps on his hands and referred him to Marmagkiolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning sign of high cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yellow deposits under the skin are a red flag for cardiologists to check cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that is a way of the body to eliminate the additional cholesterol from the bloodstream whenever it cannot process it,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bumps appear on eyelids, the most common location, they’re called xanthelasmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This file image shows xanthelasma on the eyelid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whey they show up on other parts of the body, including hands, elbows and soles of feet, they’re called xanthomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 1% of patients with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/eating-lower-cholesterol-rcna48052" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; will develop these lumps, with a genetic predisposition playing a role, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yellow deposits themselves are completely painless and harmless — they’re simply a visual signal of a possible metabolic disorder, he adds. Once they appear, they generally don’t go away, but can be removed by a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this patient’s case, the bumps indicated “an amazing amount of cholesterol in his bloodstream,” the cardiologist notes. In general, such extreme levels are an urgent condition that needs immediate medical attention, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This patient had a total blood cholesterol of more than 1,000, about five times the healthy level for adults.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol leads to plaque buildup in the arteries, raising the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol/living-with" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors advised the patient to immediately switch to a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/heart-healthy-foods-rcna122367" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; and take medications to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a carnivore diet healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are interested in the carnivore diet and other &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-keto-everything-know-about-ketogenic-diet-t217117" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keto diets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;keto diets&lt;/a&gt; because they feel full while losing weight, Marmagkiolis says. The lack of carbohydrates forces the body to burn fat for energy rather than glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits include eliminating sugar, refined grains and ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes, Kirkpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carnivore diet provides nutrients including riboflavin, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, selenium and vitamin A; but it falls short on magnesium, calcium, vitamin C and fiber, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722875/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can experience nutrient deficiencies because they're cutting out plant-based foods, which are high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, Kirkpatrick notes. Not eating enough vegetables can lead to poor gut health and constipation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, patients who follow such extreme diets are at much higher risk of having abnormal cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy London, a Georgia heart surgeon who was not involved in the case report, says the carnivore diet may work for some, but most people will be healthiest when eating a balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are made to run on proteins, fats and carbohydrates,” London tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything in the extreme is rarely going to be beneficial. … In general, if you are focusing on whole foods where you’re eating lean meats, leafy greens, vegetables and fruits and fiber, you’re going to do fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is the healthiest, both doctors say, pointing to studies that show benefits for the heart and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are still interested in following the carnivore diet should keep an eye on their cholesterol profile with blood work and consult with a dietitian or a physician who can monitor the effects of eating only animal products, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-cholesterol-hands-rcna192565" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1uMl94MkJValJHcTVRNEZSRkxEa2xRWE9vMXJVQThRa2cyQWd2WVpockFWZ3VCM2xiN0dBTVdvNTEwcWR4THNSMUlKOExXSXNKX19FaDhYcDFhMVJXZmxEd1RfUzNiTGFSN3RRZHBreUJDZHJ6d1E</guid></item><item><title>Trump administration yanks CDC flu vaccine campaign - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOVGxWYWw5NWQ2NjYwdXo4NkFxZDN2Tm1icFJPNjRNQlZjVFQwbG1QRXFtZGZFaV9SX2lTM1cwZ1ZDRnVVRl9uN3hub3Y4NkEtUEtOVmdXdTNXemt1dFZZZlliWkJnRzFlS1kzU2tKUkVRZ01lbWIxemE0SkN5LVhDY0lMLUx0aUc4Y2hVRXpjRWFLUlhXTVlscGc5czdKZmRhY3RnRnJPQkRBT0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stopping a successful flu vaccination campaign that &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;juxtaposed images of wild animals&lt;/a&gt;, such as a lion, with cute counterparts, like a kitten, as an analogy for how immunization can help tame the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The news was shared with staff during a meeting on Wednesday, according to two CDC staffers who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, and a recording reviewed by NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During the meeting, leadership at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told&lt;/a&gt; CDC staff the Department of Health and Human Services had reviewed the campaign and advised that it would not continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move comes during Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first full week on the job as head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The "Wild to Mild" flu vaccination campaign sought to encourage people to get the flu vaccine. In particular, the campaign aimed to communicate that flu vaccination can lessen symptoms and the chance of getting severely ill, even if it doesn't prevent someone from catching the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's decision to pull the campaign comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-05.html" target="_blank"&gt;midst of a brutal flu season&lt;/a&gt; that's still raging. More than 50,000 patients were admitted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitals for influenza&lt;/a&gt; during the week ending Feb. 8, the highest level in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Paid media for the ad campaign was ending on Wednesday, according to the current CDC staff member who spoke to NPR. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the "Wild to Mild" vaccination campaign is already offline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Requests for comment to the CDC and HHS were not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The campaign sought to "reset public expectations around what a flu vaccine can do in the event that it does not entirely prevent illness," &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC's webpage describing the launch of the campaign in 2023. It was renewed for the current flu season.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We found that it was very successful—people understood the message, [and] they were swayed by the message," Erin Burns, associate director for communications in the CDC's influenza division, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/cdc-unleashes-wild-mild-campaign-again-ramp-flu-vaccine-rates" target="_blank"&gt;told the trade website&lt;/a&gt; Fierce Pharma in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The campaign was a response to falling flu vaccination rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and targeted groups at higher risk, the CDC's launch webpages said, "especially pregnant women and children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The CDC campaign is a creative and effective way of conveying an extremely important public health message about 'partial protection' vs. 'complete prevention' of disease," Marla Dalton, executive director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told NPR in an email.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it was primarily digital, the campaign also found a home in public transit over the fall. "Wild to Mild" branding was wrapped around trains in four major cities and ads were featured at mass transit stations. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.izsummitpartners.org/content/uploads/CDC-NCIRD_Flu-Campaign_NIVW-Slides.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;presentation from CDC&lt;/a&gt; in November, those ads reached more than 30 million riders and generated another 30 million digital impressions by the end of October last year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear how much time was left in the campaign, but it would have at least gone through the end of this flu season and the materials would have stayed on the agency's website, one of the CDC staffers told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes at federal health agencies?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 740,000 suicides are reported annually: that's one death on average every 43 seconds, one of the many disturbing findings in the latest and most comprehensive analysis &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00006-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine in Seattle conducted a deep dive of the Global Burden of Disease data by region, country, year, age, sex, and suicide by firearms from 1990 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last three decades, the global age-standardized mortality rate for suicide declined by nearly 40%, from about 15 deaths per 100,000 to 9 deaths per 100,000, indicating that intervention and prevention are working. For females, the rate declined by more than 50%, while it declined by almost 34% for males. Regionally, East Asia recorded the largest decline of 66% with China reporting the largest decline in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the progress is encouraging, it's not universal. Four regions reported increases in the suicide rate for both sexes combined during the same period. Central Latin America had the highest jump at 39%, with Mexico at the top of the region's list with a 123% increase for females alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andean Latin America had the second highest increase of 13%, with Ecuador recording the largest rise for both sexes combined in the region. Tropical Latin America was third with a 9% increase, and Paraguay was at the top of the region's list for both sexes combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-income North America registered a 7% increase, with the U.S. at the top of the region's list with a 23% jump for females alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 2021 global causes of death, suicide was ranked 21st (higher than HIV/AIDS) for both sexes combined. Regionally, the highest mortality rates from suicide were in Eastern Europe, Southern sub-Saharan Africa, and Central sub-Saharan Africa. For males, suicide was the 19th-leading cause of death globally, with Eastern Europe recording the highest death rate. For females, suicide was ranked 27th globally, with South Asia having the highest rate for females.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"While the progress made in declining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicide+rates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicide rates&lt;/a&gt; is encouraging, it is clear that suicide continues to impact some countries and populations more than others. Removing suicide stigma and barriers to access mental health support systems remain critical measures, particularly among people with mental and substance abuse disorders," said senior author Dr. Mohsen Naghavi with IHME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies found that victims of violence, sexual assault, and childhood trauma are observed to be at increased risk for suicide. Research has consistently shown that access to lethal means, such as guns and pesticide, is associated with higher rates of suicides. Prior evidence suggests that poverty and social deprivation are also associated with suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers also underscore a grim difference between males and females globally, regionally, and nationally. Males were more than twice as likely to die from suicide than females, but females were 49% more likely to attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, every minute, four men and six women needed inpatient treatment due to suicide attempts. Overall, the mortality rate for suicide was 12.8 per 100,000 population for males and 5.4 per 100,000 population for females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicide+attempts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicide attempts&lt;/a&gt; requiring &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical care&lt;/a&gt; that did not result in death was three times higher for females compared to males. This difference was highest in high-income North America, with one in 30.7 attempts resulting in death for females and one in 6.3 attempts resulting in death for males.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Globally, males were more than three times as likely to die by suicide using firearms than females: 10% of suicides by males were with guns, while 3% of suicides by females were with guns. The U.S. had the highest firearm-related suicides in the world: nearly 22,000 or 55% of suicides by males were with guns, while more than 3,000 or nearly 31% of suicides by females were with guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Men tend to choose more violent and lethal methods of suicide such as guns, while women are more likely to choose less fatal means such as poisoning and overdosing, which have a higher survival rate," said Emily Rosenblad, the study's second author and project officer at IHME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both males and females globally are dying by suicide later in life. In 1990, the average age at death for males was 43 years, and for females it was almost 42 years. By 2021, the average age at death had climbed to 47 for males and nearly 47 for females. The highest mean age was about 58 years for males and 60 years for females, both in East Asia. Conversely, the youngest average age at suicide was found in Oceania, where it was 36 years for males and 34 years for females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study identifies the existing patterns and trends to develop more effective suicide prevention methods around the world, which can help policymakers and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+workers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; develop better-customized strategies and approaches for specific locations and populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suicide prevention is most effective when communities work together through awareness, intervention, and support systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The spending likely reflects populations who are proactive about seeking medical care when they’re feeling ill and have the insurance or money to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CNCEFMZPCNHJHD7GUPYA42QM6E"&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2024.26790" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; on U.S. health care spending released last week by researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830568?guestAccessKey=783582d7-4e27-4a8c-8b5a-ecebb4c21894&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=021425" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830568?guestAccessKey=783582d7-4e27-4a8c-8b5a-ecebb4c21894&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=021425"&gt;published in the Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from over 3,000 counties in the U.S., tallying variations in spending and the different types of people accessed from coast to coast between 2010 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5MBQYHFYZEVPKRRAR4LXNKVMQ"&gt;The research tracked payments for 148 health conditions by examining more than 40 billion insurance claims — from Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans — and 1 billion facility records to produce what they say is the most comprehensive study on U.S. health care spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3JCGTIKWKJDNTH2ICKOJ7MTUGY"&gt;The UW studies emerge at a time when consumers are grappling with increasing medical costs. A recent report by &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;consulting firm PwC&lt;/a&gt; projects that consumers this year will see the highest increase in health care costs in 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AD7AYFZZGVFTRLNRRFNBA7YUUA"&gt;The University of Washington report found Oregon spent $30.3 billion on health care in 2019, roughly $7 billion more than in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HO7L274TUZGQJIDVHFKA2DSTVI"&gt;The total includes spending from all sources — patients, insurance and government programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rawhtml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LGN5WIUBERCQTJS6WBKJXJQPQ4"&gt;On a per-person basis, health care spending in Oregon rose from $5,888 in 2010 to $7,205 in 2019, a 22% increase. This growth outpaced the national growth rate of 16% during the same period. However, despite the faster growth, Oregon still spent less on health care per person by the dollar amount than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Health care spending varies across Oregon counties&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I63XWAXR2NATRLLHBQXQUWB5XA"&gt;The study revealed significant disparities in health care spending at the county level. Even after adjusting for factors like age and health conditions, people in some Oregon counties spent considerably more than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUHGEMSIJZEMLOHRYPKI23R57M"&gt;According to researchers, this suggests that differences in health care costs aren’t just due to populations being older or sicker but may also stem from factors like how often people use health services, local pricing and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PRCMLUAZDNHKFO6KMG5OHDWGH4"&gt;The counties with the highest health care spending per capita were likely linked to more residents being proactive about their health and seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P72YIXMUAJAVDHR6GMIAGPHN34"&gt;For instance, Clackamas and Deschutes counties led the state in ambulatory care visits, which include primary care, outpatient specialty services, urgent care, and rehabilitation programs. Not only did residents in these counties seek medical care more often, but they also had the highest per-person spending on physician and outpatient services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UOOMX3MOSZFCJEJFVTJJJUFJ64"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Wheeler and Umatilla counties spent the least on health care per person in 2019 — $5,455 and $5,959, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOXFIUHWMNAKZGJGPGF2M7TX3U"&gt;Neither ranks among Oregon’s wealthiest regions. Wheeler County has a median household income of $40,926 — making it the state’s third-poorest county — and also has one of Oregon’s oldest populations, with a median age of 59. Despite this, residents of Wheeler County visited the doctor less often than any other county in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTPQKZACTZDKLOX3B2CJUOAVQY"&gt;Meanwhile, Umatilla County has a median household income of $56,700, below the statewide median of $62,818. With a median age of 36.5 years, Umatilla is one of Oregon’s youngest counties, which may help explain why residents generally used fewer health care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXH4WJZM55DRXF4SI4AJ5JJFS4"&gt;“Just because some counties in Oregon spend more than other counties in the state does not mean that there’s fundamentally a problem,” said Dr. Joseph Dieleman, an associate professor at the University of Washington and lead author of the study. He said there are a number of reasons why people in some counties are spending more on health care than in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ILUOQ4X55HCFMYEH75LV7KB5A"&gt;One major factor is the cost of living. Dieleman said health care services tend to be more expensive in areas where general living expenses are higher. The age and the overall health of a county’s population play a role in spending patterns, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:MXIJQI3R7BEBLNUY5YM7V4CTFQ" data-fusion-component="MXIJQI3R7BEBLNUY5YM7V4CTFQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:MXIJQI3R7BEBLNUY5YM7V4CTFQ" data-fusion-component="MXIJQI3R7BEBLNUY5YM7V4CTFQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IHSWR6HKXJE7NNHKSKD5Q2PNDU"&gt;Dieleman and his colleagues also found that counties with older populations generally require more medical care, while areas with higher rates of chronic illness also tend to have greater health expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WYYYWYVWXFG5TN36GBDG5LHYKQ"&gt;“There’s some places with older populations, and we know we spend more on older populations and less on younger populations,” he added. “Finally, some places are sicker than others. So some of the variation can be explained by disease prevalence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RFUF5H2NEZFCDFETRHPG6ZWOBU"&gt;But the key factor driving the disparities in health spending was utilization. Some counties see higher rates of doctor visits and hospitalizations, even when their populations are not significantly older or sicker than others, Dieleman said. He noted that about 65% of spending variation in the study was linked to how often people sought medical care, rather than differences in treatment costs, age or disease prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P7SQEGQSOZD7XMGLR3YAO5E53A"&gt;“That means people are going to the doctor for an illness, much more so than in other places,” Dieleman said. “Or they’re seeking more intense treatments at the hospital or going to the emergency department instead of going to a primary care provider or outpatient clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4GGPGPOSXBAV5L4N2THWVYHNGQ"&gt;The report attributed much of the variation in health spending to how often people sought care at doctors’ offices, urgent care and any outpatient clinical settings. The counties with the highest spending overall — such as Clackamas, Deschutes and Lane counties — also spent more on doctor visits or outpatient clinical services, as well as on prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Health spending by payer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="55R4QKNMGZHSXA7JVE55PEYKZQ"&gt;The study also examined how different types of health insurance contribute to spending variations across Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BCSE6YIMPNEBZGJ3E6C33TPIWI"&gt;Clackamas County led the state in private insurance spending per patient and had the highest out-of-pocket costs per person. Deschutes County had the highest Medicare spending per beneficiary, while Union County recorded the highest Medicaid spending per beneficiary at $7,357.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HAWB3PEN3BEALKS42RBYBOPGSA"&gt;Insurance coverage plays a significant role in spending patterns. The study found that counties with higher incomes and higher rates of private insurance enrollment generally used health care services more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Are health care dollars going where they’re needed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XR36AK66JFHHXIYBPNO45XZ2VE"&gt;One key question the study did not address is whether higher spending leads to better health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKWTKJGZW5CWVERENMRIUEVFLY"&gt;Some counties with high spending saw more frequent doctor visits and medical procedures. But the study didn’t investigate whether higher spending and more frequent trips to the doctor produce better health outcomes for their residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UKBWHRP5S5CLDM2AVWR5UOGTMY"&gt;The study also explored which health conditions are associated with the highest spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:ZLWT6LL4NZG4JLE4LJMD6EEZPU" data-fusion-component="ZLWT6LL4NZG4JLE4LJMD6EEZPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:ZLWT6LL4NZG4JLE4LJMD6EEZPU" data-fusion-component="ZLWT6LL4NZG4JLE4LJMD6EEZPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T5NMP7CMABCNLCREPVETUSA4LE"&gt;Data revealed that oral disorders, such as cavities and uneven teeth, drove the most spending in the state. But there were significant disparities in dental care spending across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QORD6JZFFRAZTDF6VSX4IHAIR4"&gt;For example, Multnomah County had the highest per-person dental care spending in Oregon at $694, which was nearly four times the amount spent in Gilliam and Sherman counties, where dental costs per person were about $175. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A4UTL4GFWRFDXGH65L3HKP7K5U"&gt;Dieleman said that counties with greater access to dentists and higher rates of dental insurance tend to spend more on oral health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NMULJUXYPRHKZC3E56WKIBRQSI"&gt;“What’s super interesting is that more than half of the spending for oral care and treatments from dental offices come from out of pocket because a lot of people don’t have dental insurance,” he said. “That’s a really big deal because it means people are essentially shelling out resources to pay for that, and it has such a direct impact on people’s household budgets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LFXRZMAETFD3DILI5VU32KYCOM"&gt;Data from the study suggests that spending priorities may not always align with the most pressing health concerns. In Oregon, the leading causes of poor health in 2019 included ischemic heart disease, low back pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Yet, data shows that the bulk of the state’s health care dollars that year went toward treating oral disorders, musculoskeletal disorders and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T7FTUS2AWVEU7GSAQWK6THEUQE"&gt;While this does not necessarily mean that too much is being spent on dental care, the findings raise questions about whether overall health care spending is closely aligned with the population’s greatest medical needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="US3SZLSECJB6HN6DT4QLWIWXJY"&gt;“Some of the variation in spending is really unexplained and kind of mysterious,” he said. “It raises more questions and warrants further analysis to find out why that exists. There’s so much variation in utilization—it suggests that some places may not be getting enough care, while others might be getting more than they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XVTR7BKP5ZF5XIJCDPIXWF7NIA"&gt;--&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/staff/kristinedeleon/posts.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Kristine de Leon&lt;/a&gt; covers consumer health, small business and data enterprise stories.

&lt;p&gt;Deaths of millions of laying hens imperil President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring down everyday costs, as grocery stores ration supplies and restaurants raise prices for egg dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments to the U.S. from Turkey began this month and will continue until July, said Ibrahim Afyon, chairman of the Egg Producers Central Union in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The export will take place through our member companies with the required authorizations, while two firms will coordinate the process,” Afyon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A total of 15,000 tonnes of eggs — equivalent to 700 containers — will be shipped,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has been working to contain bird flu, which was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas last March and has since spread to more than 970 herds in 17 states. The virus has infected nearly 70 people since April, primarily farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cattle. One person who was infected died.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in poultry began in 2022 and has wiped out about 162 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, according to U.S. data. A surge in recent infections is fuelling egg shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We support the temporary import of egg products to help ease the strain on the U.S. egg supply,” said Chad Gregory, CEO of United Egg Producers, a cooperative that represents U.S. egg farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with supply constraints, U.S. companies have sought alternative import markets, leading to negotiations with Turkish producers, Afyon said. The deal is expected to generate around $26 million in export revenue, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey ranks among the world’s top 10 egg exporters, Afyon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture had no comment on imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is rebuilding a stockpile of bird flu vaccines for poultry and granted a conditional license to animal health company Zoetis for a vaccine for chickens. USDA has not yet authorized the use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

USDA regulators must give a final OK to the vaccine before poultry farmers can start administering it.  (More &lt;a href="/tag/14230/1/h5n1.html"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; stories.)

This process, called the Attention, Arousal, and Release Spiral, creates a cycle where focused attention leads to joy, making concentration effortless and deepening the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gathered firsthand accounts from meditation retreats and worship services, analyzing the micro-moments of attention and emotional shifts. Preliminary brain activity findings suggest both practices involve a cognitive shift that enhances immersion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this shared mechanism could help more people access profound states of focus and tranquility. The next phase of research will use brain imaging to explore the physiological changes behind this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Both jhāna meditation and speaking in tongues follow a self-reinforcing cycle of attention, joy, and surrender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Early findings suggest both practices induce a mental shift that enhances deep focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain imaging will help map the physiological changes behind this experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two seemingly opposite spiritual practices – Buddhist jhāna meditation and the Christian practice of speaking in tongues – have more in common than previously thought, a new study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one is quiet and deeply focused, and the other emotionally charged and expressive, both appear to harness the same cognitive feedback loop to create profound states of joy and surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107894"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people surrounded by an orange light" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/spiritual-belief-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This joy makes attention feel effortless, leading to a feeling of surrender, which deepens the experience. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-led by Michael Lifshitz, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at McGill University and Investigator at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, with collaborators from Monash University and the University of Toronto, identified a phenomenon they call the Attention, Arousal and Release Spiral – a mental cycle that deepens both meditative and energized states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Human Biology,&lt;/em&gt; offers new insights into how humans can cultivate deep states of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can understand this process better, we may be able to help more people access deep states of tranquility and bliss for themselves,” said Lifshitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In another sense, our findings may help to promote a sense of commonality and mutual respect between spiritual traditions. Despite differences in beliefs, we are all sharing a human experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common pathway to bliss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that both jhāna meditators and those speaking in tongues enter a reinforcing cycle: they focus their attention on an object, such as the breath in meditation or God in prayer, which triggers a sense of joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This joy makes attention feel effortless, leading to a feeling of surrender, which deepens the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, this spiralling dynamic leading to increasingly deep and effortless bliss is a novel idea in the psychological sciences,” said Lifshitz. “It’s fascinating that these radically different spiritual traditions seem to have discovered it and made use of it in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover this link, researchers collected firsthand accounts from Buddhist meditation retreats and evangelical Christian worship services in the U.S. They asked participants to describe the subtle micro-moments of their attention and emotional state during their practice. They also recorded the practitioners’ brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While full neurobiological results are still being analyzed, early findings suggest that both practices involve a cognitive shift that allows for a uniquely immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step involves using brain imaging techniques to map the physiological changes that occur as attention, arousal and release unfold in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Spiral of Attention, Arousal, and Release: A Comparative Phenomenology of Jhāna Meditation and Speaking in Tongues” by Josh Brahinsky, Jonas Mago, Mark Miller, Shaila Catherine and Michael Lifshitz&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;was published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Human Biology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Templeton Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotheology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#305b55595c511e545540514055705d5357595c5c1e5351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Balachandran, lead investigator of the trial and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In this small, preliminary trial of 16 patients, half had a strong immune response to the vaccine.

While dramatic headlines fuel unnecessary fear, simple precautions significantly lower the chance of infection." data-app-id-name="post_above_content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/health/woman-30-infected-by-brain-worms-after-trip-to-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Recent media reports&lt;/a&gt; quickly caught our attention, as they may have yours. They highlighted something that’s a genuine health concern in Hawaii—rat lungworm disease. However, these reports took a sensationalized approach, using dramatic headlines that could lead one to believe there is some unavoidable risk for Hawaii visitors. While the disease is rare and has the potential to be severe, its simple prevention is something that we have incorporated into our daily lives; the reality is far less alarming when placed in a good context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-cases-of-rat-lungworm-are-preventable-with-basic-food-safety"&gt;Most cases of rat lungworm are preventable with basic food safety.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Travelers can continue to enjoy Hawaii’s beauty and cuisine without unnecessary concern by understanding how the disease spreads and then taking the simple steps that significantly reduce exposure. That’s what we and other Hawaii residents have done since this first came to our attention years ago. Taking these small steps ensures you can safely enjoy Hawaii’s diverse produce and culinary offerings without much concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thoroughly-inspect-and-wash-produce-thoroughly"&gt;Thoroughly inspect and wash produce thoroughly. &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This simple step removes snails, slugs, and their slime from produce. It’s especially important for locally grown leafy greens like lettuce, basil, and kale, whether bought from farmers’ markets, roadside stands or stores. For residents, this becomes second nature—starting with checking for signs of slug or snail damage. Visitors should adopt the same habit for added safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rat-lungworm-disease-angiostrongyliasis-is-a-parasitic-infection"&gt;Rat lungworm disease (angiostrongyliasis) is a parasitic infection.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The parasite’s life cycle begins in rats, with snails and slugs acting as intermediate hosts. Humans become infected when they accidentally consume raw or undercooked snails, slugs, &lt;span&gt;or perhaps most importantly to visitors, products that have been contaminated with droppings and slime&lt;/span&gt;. The disease is neither transmitted between humans nor linked to ocean waters or casual exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symptoms-of-rat-lungworm-disease-range-from-mild-to-severe"&gt;The symptoms of rat lungworm disease range from mild to severe.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early signs often include nausea, headaches, stomach pain, and fatigue. However, neurological symptoms such as tingling sensations, burning pain, and neck stiffness can develop in rare and severe cases that may lead to meningitis. While there is no direct cure, doctors treat patients by managing symptoms with pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, the disease is rare in Hawaii, with annual cases averaging up to a dozen across all islands. While the condition is monitored closely, officials emphasize that the risk remains low, especially for those who take proper precautions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-hawaii-affected"&gt;Why is Hawaii affected?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s lush, tropical environment creates ideal conditions for hosts like snails and slugs to thrive. This makes the islands well suited to outbreaks compared to more temperate regions. However, even in Hawaii, most cases can be traced back to specific exposures involving unwashed produce or raw food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Island has historically reported the highest number of cases, though instances have also been documented on other islands, including Maui, Kauai, and Oahu. Leafy greens, especially those from home gardens or farmers markets, are sometimes linked to transmission when thorough washing is overlooked. Despite this, people consume fresh produce in Hawaii every year without ever having an issue issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s Department of Health actively monitors rat lungworm disease and keeps the public informed. Thanks to ongoing education efforts and heightened awareness, especially among residents (and now hopefully visitors), cases have remained consistently low relative to the population.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Recent headlines have overstated rat lungworm disease. It is being overhyped as an urgent and widespread threat, which is not the case. This portrayal lacks the understanding of the actual risks. Some stories imply that anyone visiting Hawaii is automatically at risk; this is not true. The disease is not airborne and cannot be contracted from casual contact or activities like swimming, hiking, or enjoying outdoor spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another typical exaggeration is that all foods in Hawaii, especially local produce, are dangerous to eat. This claim is not supported by evidence. While unwashed greens can carry risks, most restaurants, grocery stores, and markets in Hawaii adhere to strict safety standards, making their produce safe for consumption. Visitors who practice basic food hygiene virtually eliminate their exposure to the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports also tend to highlight extreme cases, focusing almost entirely on severe symptoms and long-term complications. While these outcomes are possible, they represent a minority of cases. The majority of infections involve mild symptoms that resolve with appropriate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-suspect-exposure"&gt;What to do if you suspect exposure.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those worried about potential exposure, staying calm and monitoring for symptoms is key. Contacting a medical professional early is vital if symptoms like persistent headaches, tingling sensations, or neck stiffness develop. Hawaii’s healthcare providers are experienced in identifying and treating rat lungworm disease, and they can offer tailored care to address individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though cases are rare, local health systems are prepared to manage the disease effectively. Many cases involve mild symptoms and resolve easily without long-term issues when caught and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-look-at-historical-perspectives"&gt;A look at historical perspectives.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has dealt with rat lungworm disease for decades, yet the highest-reported cases remain in the single digits annually per island. Historical events, such as cluster cases, sparked essential changes in how the community approaches food safety. Increased public health campaigns and inspections of farm produce have become standard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Farmers, retailers, and residents alike have embraced best practices like cleaning produce more thoroughly before it reaches consumers. These efforts ensure that most locally grown produce is entirely safe to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enjoying-hawaii-without-any-unnecessary-worry"&gt;Enjoying Hawaii without any unnecessary worry.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii offers an unmatched experience filled with vibrant farmers markets, unparalleled landscapes, and fresh, local food. With basic precautions, visitors can enjoy these highlights without worrying about rat lungworm disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Washing produce, keeping an eye out for snail damage, droppings and slime, avoiding raw, risky foods, and staying informed are all simple steps to minimize an already low risk further. By focusing on practical safety measures rather than sensationalized fears, travelers can confidently explore the islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease is a rare but real health issue in Hawaii that can be approached with confidence and good practices. While media reports like this may overstate the risks, the danger is small and preventable. Awareness, not fear, is the best way to address this concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We welcome your comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research has suggested that shifting your routine can help you lower your risk—whether that means enjoying &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colorectal-cancer-milk-study-8775172" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a glass of milk&lt;/a&gt; or aiming for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/inflammation-colon-cancer-study-8761229" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods and habits&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have suggested that yogurt, in particular, may offer protection against colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Eating yogurt and the bacteria it contains can improve the health of the gut and the health of the gut lining,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sarah-pflugradt-8655704" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a performance nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://sarahpflugradt.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Pflugradt Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “Adding good bacteria to the gut can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can help lower inflammation and have an antioxidant effect, and this can impact the development of cancer.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of these beneficial bacteria is called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;. If it looks familiar to you, it might be because you’ve seen it listed on your yogurt container. It’s one of the gut-friendly bacteria used to make yogurt and one that researchers believe may help prevent colon cancer.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Brigham and Women’s, a Harvard teaching hospital in Boston, took a closer look at colon tumors in people who have regularly eaten yogurt for many years. Their findings are published in the February 2025 issue of &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what they found.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from two long-term U.S. studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; started in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; started in 1986). For this study, researchers included 87,379 women from the NHS and 44,677 men from the HPFS for a total of 132,056 participants. Baseline data was gathered and updated every two years to collect data on demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history and disease outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For both the NHS and HPFS, dietary information was gathered at baseline and updated about every 4 years. For this study, researchers categorized participants based on their yogurt intake: &amp;lt;1 serving/month, 1-3 servings/month, 1 serving/week and ≥2 servings/week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each participant was followed until 2016, a colon cancer diagnosis or death, whichever came first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those participants with a colon cancer diagnosis, researchers wanted to know how much, if any, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;was found in their cancer tumors, and if there was an association between yogurt consumption and the type of tumors. This meant they were going deeper than just an overall association between yogurt consumption and colon cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There ended up being a total of 3,079 colon cases during the study period. Among those, 346 (31%) were &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium-&lt;/em&gt;positive cases, and 775 (69%) were &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium-&lt;/em&gt;negative cases. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re feeling confused, that’s understandable. After all, if &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;is supposed to help prevent colon cancer, why was it found in 31% of the colon cancer cases? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers don’t have a final answer on that yet, but they surmise that &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;in colon cancer tumors may be there to help fight the cancer. They also say that &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive colon tumors may suggest impaired intestinal barrier function. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leaky gut syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve heard of the intestinal barrier. At its healthiest, your intestinal barrier is a selectively permeable wall that allows your gut to absorb nutrients but keep in bacteria and undigested food particles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If it’s not functioning properly, toxins and other substances may be able to cross the barrier—which could explain how &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;enters the cancer tumor.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-negative tumors appeared twice as often as the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive ones, the study authors propose that yogurt intake may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer when your intestinal barrier is disrupted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this study, participants reporting higher yogurt intake were also more likely to have higher intakes of total folate, calcium and vitamin D, plus they were more regularly screened with colonoscopies, were more physically active and were less likely to smoke or consume processed and red meat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All of these behaviors are linked to a lower risk of colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So not only did they eat plenty of yogurt, but they also tended to engage in overall healthy habits. This stresses the importance of taking a big-picture view of your health habits. While some foods and behaviors help reduce the risk of disease, there is no one magic potion, food or behavior that completely erases the risk of anything. It’s a collaborative effort that involves every area of your life.     
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that higher yogurt intake is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. In particular, it appears to protect against &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive colon cancer tumors. This is likely due to having more beneficial gut bacteria, which help protect the colon. Other fermented foods that add helpful bacteria to your gut include kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since bacteria need to eat to thrive, be sure to also include plenty of high-fiber foods—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. Limit or avoid red meat and processed meats, ultra-processed foods and foods and beverages with a lot of added sugar. And keeping your whole health in mind, move more often, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-6-hours-of-sleep-enough-8692438" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;get plenty of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, manage your stressors and spend quality time with family and friends. In doing so, you’ll not only reduce your risk of disease—including colon cancer—but you’ll also improve your quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;A cold, also known as the common cold, is a viral infection of your nose and throat. It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the symptoms of a cold include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, slight body aches, sneezing, and low-grade fever. These symptoms usually last for about a week to 10 days. However, if your cold symptoms persist for more than two weeks, it could be a sign of a more serious condition like a sinus infection or another respiratory illness, and it’s advisable to consult a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cold-sickness-health-care_l_63d80e3ce4b0c8e3fc7fdd4f"&gt;HuffPost Life&lt;/a&gt;, first test to make sure your cold symptoms are not a sign of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or influenza. These infections spread in similar ways and have common overlapping symptoms. You can use at-home tests to detect these illnesses or go to your healthcare provider for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your cold symptoms seem to be getting worse, this may mean something else is going on. Shortness of breath, wheezing or chest pain aren’t usually associated with a cold and may signal pneumonia, asthma or even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say that while colds are caused by viruses, a lingering illness signals that you may have developed a bacterial infection like sinusitis. Symptoms include a phlegmy cough, facial pain or swelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marwan Azar, an infectious disease expert at Yale Medicine says that ongoing cold symptoms such as a recurring cough or an irritated throat that lasts more than two weeks could also be due to persistent inflammation caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts also warn that if you don’t give your body enough time to rest and recover from your cold, it may linger longer. Make sure you are adequately resting, hydrating and getting enough sleep. If you are treating your cold correctly and symptoms continue after three weeks, seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;

            Protein shakes, pre-workout mixes and other supplements aren’t always just a part of a gym routine. In adolescents and young adults, they could be connected to a body image disorder that exhibits a pathological focus on muscle development and leanness, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00083b6mmy8v4gdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of 6 different dietary supplements intended for muscle building was associated with greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia,” said lead study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto, via email. “This included whey protein powder and creatine, both of which are commonly used among young people trying to gain muscle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00093b6my41c50oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The association was especially strong with supplements for gaining weight or mass, and the symptoms, such as excessive gym time and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;obsessing over food intake, increased as the number of supplements used grew, according to a new study published Wednesday in journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study team analyzed data from 2,731 participants ages 16 to 30 of the &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/canadian-study-of-adolescent-health-behaviors/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to gather information on disordered eating, muscle-building behavior, body image and social health. The researchers analyzed the participants’ reports of supplement use against their symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, which were assessed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6239320/" target="_blank"&gt;the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory&lt;/a&gt;, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000b3b6m7ohuv0tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning it’s hard to say whether the use of supplements increased the symptoms of muscle dysmorphia or if people with more muscle dysmorphia symptoms were more likely to take more supplements, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College. Saltz was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000c3b6muchf6voc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study shows that younger people who may not use &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/health/bodybuilding-steroids-testicular-damage-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, which have been found to be harmful, might still be using other substances to treat their muscle dysmorphia, and the public needs to be more aware, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000d3b6ma8k7k6jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people think supplements are safe because it’s just a supplement,” she said. “But in fact, that is not always the case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000e3b6mzskzpowv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/" target="_blank"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in which an individual is preoccupied with an imagined defect in their appearance, Saltz said. Those with muscle dysmorphia believe their body should be leaner and more muscular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000f3b6mcd5cdslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who experience muscle dysmorphia often have significant challenges in their social lives, and can experience severe emotional distress,” Ganson said. “Not to mention, these individuals may go to extreme lengths to achieve their body ideal, such as using anabolic steroids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000g3b6m8n168aan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it isn’t just a matter of lowered confidence, Saltz said. Even if people with this disorder reach the ideal image they are striving for, it doesn’t fix the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000h3b6m7g1lp4yw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When they look in the mirror, they don’t see what you see when you look at them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000i3b6mp7ackz6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other warning signs include having a rigid exercise routine, experiencing emotional distress, and facing difficulty completing expectations such as school and work, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000j3b6m76ll636f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You might also see people with muscle dysmorphic disorder avoiding socially normal body exposure — such as removing their shirts at the beach — or missing social gatherings because of feelings around their appearance, Saltz added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000k3b6mhl1vi4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using supplements to change a body’s appearance is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While 2.2% of young adult males report using steroids, 36.3% report using protein powders and shakes, while 10.1% said they use other muscle-building substances such as creatine and growth hormones, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101778" target="_blank"&gt;a June 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000m3b6mllgt6myx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most supplements are readily available with little to no regulation, and “studies analyzing these products have found that many are mislabeled and are tainted with harmful substances like anabolic steroids,” said study coauthor Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000n3b6mj1e8cbcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration does monitor adverse health impacts and occasionally inspects manufacturing facilities. However, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the agency does not have jurisdiction to approve dietary supplements before they enter the public marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000o3b6m2ss7xcni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are also few studies on supplements’ safety and efficacy, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000p3b6m0f8dk6nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle-building supplements, which may be legal, can serve as gateway drugs to steroid use,” Nagata said. “We &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235901/" target="_blank"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that young adults using muscle-building substances were three times more likely to start anabolic steroid use seven years later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000q3b6m6o0jagb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pre-workout supplements often contain caffeine — some with the same amount found in several cups of coffee, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000r3b6m13zcnh8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people “dry scoop” before a workout or consume protein powder dry without mixing in water, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000s3b6mt5n6nwnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dry scooping is particularly dangerous practice because it provides a high and potent dose of a product that is meant to be diluted in water,” he said. “Dry scooping provides a pure and highly concentrated burst of a product that can have toxic effects.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000t3b6m6ng9z09j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One important step is to challenge the information and ideals coming out of social media, especially for teens who are undergoing rapid changes and making frequent comparisons with others during puberty, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000u3b6m7gu28ic8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Social media posts about muscle-building supplements and anabolic steroids overwhelmingly demonstrate positive muscle-building effects,” he said. “Social media can exacerbate body comparisons and lead to muscle dissatisfaction and the use of anabolic steroids or other muscle-building drugs and supplements in teens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000v3b6mej4ew30e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This use of social media is especially true for boys, who are more likely to allow for a public following than girls and are more likely to show off muscles online than faces, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000w3b6mz6rz7os8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. The idealized bodies that influencers post may be heavily filtered or the best of hundreds of photos,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000x3b6ma6vgftoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to treating muscle dysmorphia, there are many methods that can be helpful, including different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; that help examine thought patterns and reframe perceptions, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00103b6mcc3f2nmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the imagined defect feels so real to the person experiencing the condition, it can be hard to have insight into the problem, she added. The people around an individual with muscle dysmorphia can help by knowing what to look for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            Protein shakes, pre-workout mixes and other supplements aren’t always just a part of a gym routine. In adolescents and young adults, they could be connected to a body image disorder that exhibits a pathological focus on muscle development and leanness, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00083b6mmy8v4gdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of 6 different dietary supplements intended for muscle building was associated with greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia,” said lead study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto, via email. “This included whey protein powder and creatine, both of which are commonly used among young people trying to gain muscle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00093b6my41c50oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The association was especially strong with supplements for gaining weight or mass, and the symptoms, such as excessive gym time and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;obsessing over food intake, increased as the number of supplements used grew, according to a new study published Wednesday in journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study team analyzed data from 2,731 participants ages 16 to 30 of the &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/canadian-study-of-adolescent-health-behaviors/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to gather information on disordered eating, muscle-building behavior, body image and social health. The researchers analyzed the participants’ reports of supplement use against their symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, which were assessed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6239320/" target="_blank"&gt;the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory&lt;/a&gt;, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000b3b6m7ohuv0tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning it’s hard to say whether the use of supplements increased the symptoms of muscle dysmorphia or if people with more muscle dysmorphia symptoms were more likely to take more supplements, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College. Saltz was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000c3b6muchf6voc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study shows that younger people who may not use &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/health/bodybuilding-steroids-testicular-damage-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, which have been found to be harmful, might still be using other substances to treat their muscle dysmorphia, and the public needs to be more aware, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000d3b6ma8k7k6jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people think supplements are safe because it’s just a supplement,” she said. “But in fact, that is not always the case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000e3b6mzskzpowv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/" target="_blank"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in which an individual is preoccupied with an imagined defect in their appearance, Saltz said. Those with muscle dysmorphia believe their body should be leaner and more muscular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000f3b6mcd5cdslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who experience muscle dysmorphia often have significant challenges in their social lives, and can experience severe emotional distress,” Ganson said. “Not to mention, these individuals may go to extreme lengths to achieve their body ideal, such as using anabolic steroids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000g3b6m8n168aan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it isn’t just a matter of lowered confidence, Saltz said. Even if people with this disorder reach the ideal image they are striving for, it doesn’t fix the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000h3b6m7g1lp4yw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When they look in the mirror, they don’t see what you see when you look at them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00103b6mcc3f2nmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the imagined defect feels so real to the person experiencing the condition, it can be hard to have insight into the problem, she added. The people around an individual with muscle dysmorphia can help by knowing what to look for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

'So unfortunately, a lot of them are made with aspartame - actually rat poison.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Number four was a little more unexpected - coconut water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Out of season, it can be a problem,' she shared with viewers. 'Not only does it have a little bit of sugar, but it does have deuterium and can really deplete your energy over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then shared the fifth and final toxic drink - fruit juice, which she labeled as the 'surprising one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Fruit juice] is very high in fructose can cause that fatty liver,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, Dr. Bowring revealed the bizarre secret to living longer - suggesting that taking fewer breaths may actually be the secret to a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The average adult takes about 15 to 20 breaths per minute, which is actually far too much,' Dr. Bowring claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Multiple analyses of real-world data, along with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00207-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in animals, have suggested that link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could be huge for those with alcohol-use disorder, which is when a person can't stop drinking even when it puts their health and safety at risk. The condition affects almost 30 million people in the U.S., and encompasses what people generally refer to as alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence or alcoholism, &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use accounts for 2.6 million deaths per year, and increases the risk of common diseases such as different cancers, the study authors wrote. There are three medications already approved for alcohol-use disorder, but the authors said only a small share of patients with the condition receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new data adds to growing evidence that GLP-1s, such as Ozempic and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy, can help people manage cravings – and not just for food and alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some preliminary research has suggested the drugs &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/beyond-appetite-suppression" target="_blank"&gt;may dampen cravings&lt;/a&gt; for smoking, opioid use, gambling, and excessive shopping by hampering activation of the brain's reward pathways. GLP-1s mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But larger and longer studies will need to confirm the effect of those drugs on addictive behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited people ages 21 to 65 who reported symptoms of alcohol-use disorder but weren't actively seeking treatment for it. Patients with diabetes and those who have previously used a GLP-1 or other weight loss medications were &lt;a href="https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/psych/0/yoi240094supp2_prod_1737737528.72584.pdf?Expires=1743013860&amp;amp;amp;Signature=bgRsJSW-hEji3glyyTgXe84iWUN2PMgqmobbZm992fBQqn1J9M2AP5v4GVQB7k03pzXo2NdsS0WUaH1Gv3ekPqman2MDK2kcjBzddY0-uIxNqh7PtqOxg0mfB19Nlhz3fsegh35f8qVjkcb0ywiTf4DjwQ82W0CdqHsfVfT5W82FZhhd9FWLbI7diVH9y6wJ~sI486eaLts0DD2oPbNbA5aB8VRIJvEDutyUyM-as~qBOa~wPF1SBqEzUhRsKLkoUgrajmmi1xW~WPC2uAt1bbA2GeQUwslBV06kV9MptmcMtTl~yLBITEuGSVh0HYLGijFI6nF9z6uzH6j4FHqkBQ__&amp;amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" target="_blank"&gt;excluded&lt;/a&gt; from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients spent two hours in a lab room stocked with their preferred alcoholic beverages – once before they started taking any drugs in the study, and once after to see what had changed. Around half of the people took low doses of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and half received placebo shots weekly for nine weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported their drinking habits and desire for alcohol throughout the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that Ozempic injections decreased weekly alcohol cravings, cut the average number of beverages consumed on drinking days and led to greater reductions in heavy drinking days when compared to the placebo. Notably, Ozempic's effect on curbing several drinking outcomes appeared to be greater than what is often seen with existing medications that aim to reduce alcohol cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the second month of the study, people who took Ozempic were drinking 30% less on average on days they consumed alcohol. That compared to an average reduction of about 2% in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40% of people who took Ozempic reported no heavy drinking days in the second month of treatment, compared with 20% in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that they used the two lowest clinical doses of semaglutide in the trial. Higher doses of the drug would "presumably yield greater effects on alcohol reduction," they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder," senior author Klara Klein of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/popular-weight-loss-diabetes-drug-shows-promise-in-reducing-cravings-for-alcohol/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among a small subgroup of people who smoked, those who took Ozempic had significantly greater reductions in average cigarettes per day compared to those in the placebo group. That suggests Ozempic may reduce both alcohol and nicotine use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plans to study whether its weight loss drugs can help treat addictive behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse.

Primary care physicians don't think it's such a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic health startup Omada released &lt;a href="https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/blog/doctors-report-concerns-about-overprescribing-and-continuity-of-care-with-patient-access-to-glp-1-medications-through-third-party-telehealth" target="_blank"&gt;a survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,000 primary care physicians last week that assessed their attitudes toward GLP-1s and various treatment plans. By and large, the doctors said they are concerned about third-party telehealth providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 20% of physicians surveyed said they would be comfortable with patients using third-party telehealth providers to access GLP-1 medications. Two-thirds of respondents said they agree that accessing the prescriptions through a third-party telehealth provider could put patients' health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was alarming, I didn't even think it would be that high," Omada President Wei-Li Shao told CNBC in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omada does not prescribe GLP-1s, but the company offers a companion program that supports patients who are taking the medications. It also aims to help patients maintain their weight loss if they decide to stop taking the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found that primary physicians are mainly worried about third-party telehealth providers for two reasons: overprescribing and continuity of care. In other words, they're concerned patients could access GLP-1s when it is not clinically appropriate, and that they might not receive the support they need through additional touch points like follow-up visits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many of the doctors surveyed are on the fence about the role of compounded GLP-1s, which are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient's needs. Compounded medications can also be produced when brand-name treatments are in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers" target="_blank"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA doesn't review the safety and efficacy of compounded products, but they can serve as alternatives to branded medications for patients who are navigating complex supply hurdles and spotty insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 45% of physicians surveyed said compounded GLP-1s are not going to be a long-term supply strategy, though they agreed that they can be helpful for addressing current shortages. And 30% of respondents said they agreed or strongly agreed that they are comfortable prescribing compounded GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients or people that are searching for solutions are confused," Shao said. "What our position has been is talk to your doctor, talk to your primary care doctor, who knows you, knows your history, knows what you've been on, and knows what your goals are, and has a perspective on what is the right treatment in partnership with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full report &lt;a href="https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/white-papers/survey-report-primary-care-perspectives-on-glp-1-prescriptions" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Health plans grapple with costs of new sickle cell gene therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been just over a year since the FDA approved sickle cell gene therapies. But in some ways the breakthrough drugs are still waiting to launch to treat patients at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than half of sickle cell patients covered by Medicaid, expanding coverage for sickle cell therapies could be difficult. States are already facing high medical costs in the joint program with the federal government, and are bracing for potential funding cuts in Congress.

"This vaccine will be used as part of Canada's contingency planning to protect people who may be at increased risk of being exposed to the virus through animals infected with avian influenza," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arepanrix H5N1 A/American wigeon clade 2.3.4.4b vaccine uses established technology for seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines. Health Canada on February 18 completed its review of GSK's regulatory submission and authorized the change in vaccine strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the general public remains low, PHAC said, adding that 60% of the doses will be equitably distributed to provinces and territories using a risk-based approach, and 40% will be kept in Canada's national stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Initial recommendations from vaccine advisers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) released &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/national-advisory-committee-immunization-summary-rapid-response-preliminary-guidance-human-vaccination-avian-influenza-non-pandemic-december-2024.html"&gt;preliminary guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the use of human vaccines against avian flu in nonpandemic settings. Though the NACI doesn't recommend broad H5N1 vaccine deployment, it outlined situations in which provinces and territories might proactively use it based on higher risk, including for lab workers and people with ongoing contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have stockpiled avian flu vaccine for people, and the United Kingdom recently ordered 5 million doses of H5 vaccine from CSL Seqirus. Finland is already vaccinating people at high risk, including workers at fur farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has reported several H5N1 detections in poultry and wild birds, especially in British Columbia, where in November a severe infection was reported in a teen whose exposure to the virus is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First H5N1 detections in rats &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today added eight more H5N1 avian flu confirmations to its list of &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;detections in mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including rats for the first time. Officials have previously confirmed the virus in mice found on affected farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the eight detections, four involved black rats that were sampled in late January in Riverside County, California, where two recent poultry outbreaks were reported, one of them involving layer pullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other infected mammals include a harbor seal in Massachusetts, a fox in North Dakota, a bobcat in Washington state, and a domestic cat in Oregon that likely relates to a recent report of two pets from Multnomah County that were sickened after eating raw pet food contaminated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APHIS hasn't posted any new poultry or dairy cattle confirmations since February 14, but today it did add three more H5N1 confirmations in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds"&gt;wild birds&lt;/a&gt;, including an agency-harvested raven in California's Riverside County, an agency-harvested duck in New Mexico (Socorro County), and a hunter-harvested duck in Alabama (Marshall County).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reversing USDA firings of avian flu response employees&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following terminations over the weekend of USDA employees who are working on the avian flu response, the agency is working quickly to restore the positions, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reported yesterday, citing a statement from a USDA spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson added that USDA Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) frontline positions are considered public safety positions and that the agency is continuing to hire the workforce needed to protect the nation's food supply according to its statutory mission. The official added that several positions were already exempted from cuts and that the USDA continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Measles is caused by the morvillivirus, which can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. "If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-does-measles-spread"&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks.

Common symptoms of measles include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;About three days after these first symptoms start, tiny white spots might appear inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three to five days after the initial symptoms begin, an infected person will develop a red, blotchy rash that often starts from the head and moves down the body. The rash can last about seven to 10 days, according to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="when-are-people-most-contagious"&gt;When are people most contagious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People infected with measles can spread the virus to other people four days before the rash appears until four days after it goes away, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/measles-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Health;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-are-the-complications-from-measles-and-who-is-at-risk"&gt;What are the complications from measles and who is at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Common complications from the virus include ear infections and diarrhea.

The CDC recommends children get their first dose at 12 to 15 months old, with the second and final dose at 4 or 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regardless of age, Hotez says, "It's never too late to go ahead and vaccinate." He cautions Americans to make sure children are vaccinated. "It was causing half a million deaths annually in the 1980s and 1970s," Hotez says. "It was the leading killer of children globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:09:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQX3FhVmpDM21GNWdCZ0tCUlJTS1hnbmZDQzMxczl2RTRzRmhJZTdFM3NFZnBWUzdRZDlzQm8zT25fcEV5VWdrSUtzMU9hN1l3SDdVdDFtMDNGTlE1OFVPdmRna2pxVF9rS3NCV2h4bDZWTVZTR1ZHSjlkcmJuc3RTR0lCVW9peE1MZk1oZS1mTmdmQTJOMjNQRGFvNWJHQlplR1l4NWdkdm1LZkdSdUlOOGhKTFpfdm43TWNrSThOTW9qd1cxVzBQRDJR</guid></item><item><title>Man unexpectedly dies during brain scan.

At first, these harsh truths may dampen our spirits and make us feel that the world is a bit colder. However, understanding some of &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/17-life-lessons-rp" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;life's hard lessons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opens us up to greater possibilities and can help us overcome the obstacles holding us back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh truths help us realize when relationships aren’t as great as they can be. They also prevent us from having too much faith in people and institutions that will ultimately disappoint us. Knowing dark truths can also help us appreciate the things that are truly beautiful, honest, and good. A Redditor named Rare_Can_5418 asked the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ew56dj/what_difficult_truths_the_sooner_you_accept_them/?" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AskReddit forum,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “What difficult truths, the sooner you accept them, the better your life will be?” and received over 6,500 responses. Many of them were centered around harsh truths about relationships and the fact that even if we do our best in life, we can still end up with the short end of the stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to keep going and never let failure get you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 15 of the “difficult truths” that made people’s lives a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stop comparing yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"There will always be someone better looking, better educated, younger, more experienced, more intelligent or wealthier than you. Do your best, live without regret, have empathy and kindness, give when you can, expecting nothing in return. Focus on your heart value more than what others have."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Comparison is the thief of joy."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Some people won't like you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can be sweetest, juiciest peach on the tree. But some people don't like peaches."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"In Spanish, there's a saying: 'Nadie es moneda de oro para que lo quiera todo el mundo,' which translates to something like nobody is a gold coin to be liked/wanted by everyone else."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Things are just things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"They don’t have feelings. They don’t care if you give them away or sell them or throw them out. If a thing is useful, keep it. If not, get rid of it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists refer to perceiving that inanimate objects have feelings as anthropomorphizing. &lt;em&gt;Psych Central&lt;/em&gt; says that humans project feelings onto objects to relate to them more deeply. "People generally anthropomorphize to make sense of events and behaviors they experience. Further, attributing emotions, attitudes, mental states, faces, and values to non-human things can help you feel connected to something," Sarah Barkley writes in a&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/why-do-we-anthropomorphize" target="_blank"&gt; PhD-reviewed article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not all friendships last&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Surprisingly though, the ones that last are not necessarily the best (or even good) ones."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Most friendships are based on convenience, I've found. Unless two people are willing to put in a lot of effort, time and distance will do more to end a friendship than any disagreement."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You may be the bad guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can do your best with someone and still be the villain in their story."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"One of my current favourite memes is: I don't care if I'm the villain in your story, you're the clown in mine."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. You can't change people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can only help people who actually want it. If they’re not ready to change or put in the effort, there’s not much you can do. Realizing this can save you a lot of frustration and help you focus on people who actually appreciate your help."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It’s always tough having those friends who are constantly complaining but doing nothing to address what they are complaining about. But as an adult, you just have to sit there and listen. No point in offering help to someone who isn’t asking for it. Kinda like how it’s really tough to teach someone who isn’t interested in being taught."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. How we judge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We judge ourselves by our intentions. We judge others by their actions."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In psychology, this is called fundamental attribution error."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fundamental Attribution Error is &lt;a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error" target="_blank"&gt;a psychological phenomenon &lt;/a&gt;where we assume someone's actions reflect their personality without considering the situation. It's like when we blame someone's driving skills for being in an accident instead of the curvy road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Depending on people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Once you're an adult, there really isn't anyone you can 100% depend on except yourself. There will still be people in your life to lean on, but everyone has their limits in how they can help you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Nice doesn't equal good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Nice people aren't always good people."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"One of my bosses doesn't greet/make small talk and is known for being quite firm. He's been the most helpful throughout my most difficult period dealing with tragedy. Some people with that personality type simply get things done when you need them done without the chattering."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Everything is temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can suddenly lose anything and anyone at any time...and maybe all at once or in quick succession without so much warning."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Nobody is thinking about you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In general, people in the real world are oblivious to you. You're not even a blip on their radar. If you're insecure about something you wear or how you look, remember: nobody cares."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. No one is coming to save you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No one is coming to save you, so you have to do it all yourself."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"And once you internalize this and do it, your self-esteem will be through the roof."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Nobody knows what they're doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Before i graduated high school I thought, thank god, I finally won’t have to deal with annoying obnoxious kids and I’ll be treated like an adult, I come to find out 95% of adults are worse then the actual kids, nobody knows what they’re actually doing and life is actually a big joke."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Love is reciprocal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If a romantic interest is not giving you the same attention/respect you give them, they don't really care about or want you, and you're in for a world of hurt if you keep telling yourself otherwise."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Who's good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People who are good for you will make you feel happy, joyful, accepted, cared for, and filled with fun times, despite any differences. People who are not good for you will make you feel anxious, sad, down, slighted, judged, and never check in on you if you're not okay, and won't even bother noticing when you're not okay. Genuine people will never let you suffer in silence or watch you suffer. Stay away from those who make you feel negative emotions and thoughts."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Upworthy</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNOHFZamRhR004TXFLZXJ4R3lXal9wVHBjd0hpXzBlejEteHlVYm9OQzkyQV9Xb1BzLXJYLVNVeXBEcERUbF9JRUZUN2E3SFZ6ZHhKT1pqZUlDcnQ0NjA2ZHY4SlpmVWc2aktFWWFZWXhOeXZjX1JTOEFjVGRXdkZYWDF4ZXpCdW1CNTllcGVEUnhvRlRFTjBhc1hKZkRBZkx6OV8tenBNR2ZjdkxrczhEQnk5RQ</guid></item><item><title>Autopsy reveals new details in man’s death after being in Knox County custody - WATE 6 On Your Side</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Many people don’t realize how crucial it is for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-may-slow-memory-decline-and-support-brain-health/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific magnesium form appears especially helpful when it comes to protecting memory and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to neurologist &lt;a href="https://www.congresodepacientesonline.com/dr-alejandro-guillermo-andersson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alejandro Andersson&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.neurologiainba.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology Institute of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium threonate stands out for anyone seeking to support thinking skills and recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described it as promising for treating neurodegenerative diseases and preventing neurological deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-and-brain-health"&gt;Magnesium and brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks associate magnesium solely with its role in muscle cramps or energy loss. However, low levels of this mineral can disrupt more than just athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/neurotoxin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurotoxins&lt;/a&gt; and other challenges can strain our nerves when magnesium is in short supply. Keeping magnesium levels steady may protect the parts of the brain linked to reasoning and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tsinghua University&lt;/a&gt; showed that boosting magnesium levels in the brain could improve short- and long-term memory in animal models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggested that this mineral increases the number of functional connections between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-better-neural-connections"&gt;Building better neural connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced amount of &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/what-glutamate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt; can support healthy communication between nerve cells. Too much of this chemical messenger might lead to overstimulation, so magnesium helps keep it in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the mineral interacts with gamma-aminobutyric acid (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;), known for its role in calming neural circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By managing these signals, magnesium threonate may promote the creation of new pathways that strengthen learning capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-linked-to-better-brain-power"&gt;Magnesium linked to better brain power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; classifies magnesium as “&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/78/17/1337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;probably effective&lt;/a&gt;” in reducing the frequency of migraines for those who get them regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stance comes from observed benefits in preventing attacks or reducing their duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38213402/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2018 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the link between adequate magnesium intake and fewer signs of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reported that people who kept their magnesium levels up showed noticeable improvements in overall mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cautions-and-usage"&gt;Cautions and usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andersson warns that individuals have their own ideal levels and it is important to clarify that magnesium is not a form of treatment but rather a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also notes that you should not self-prescribe because it can have unwanted interactions with antibiotics or other medications and, therefore, can reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorption and effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend talking with a healthcare provider before trying any new form of magnesium. They may suggest blood tests or dietary strategies to figure out an ideal plan for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, magnesium is naturally available in nuts, legumes, and leafy green vegetables. Some individuals, though, may still need specialized forms like magnesium threonate to address specific neurological or cognitive concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that healthy adults typically require around 310 to 420 milligrams of magnesium daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual needs, however, can vary depending on age, gender, and existing medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-magnesium-threonate-is-better"&gt;Why magnesium threonate is better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium threonate sets itself apart by slipping through the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519556/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; more easily than other forms of the mineral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quality seems to be the main reason for its potential advantages when supporting concentration and clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady supply of this form could help neurons fire efficiently, possibly leading to sharper focus and improved recollection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers speculate that it influences both the architecture and chemistry of brain cells in ways that other magnesium supplements might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of magnesium threonate believe it can bolster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-compensate-aging-dementia-recruiting-other-brain-regions-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain functions as people age&lt;/a&gt;. They point to its capacity for maintaining neural connections and keeping memory intact over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals see it as a smart addition when combined with good nutrition and adequate sleep. Ongoing studies continue to look at how it might help preserve cognitive well-being in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-the-brain-and-healthy-habits"&gt;Magnesium, the brain, and healthy habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting magnesium levels doesn’t mean skipping standard advice for staying mentally sharp. Eating a balanced diet, moving regularly, and managing stress still form the backbone of any plan for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/playing-instrument-lifelong-music-engagement-better-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;better brain performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone concerned about deficiency should seek guidance from a qualified professional. Simple blood work or dietary evaluations can offer insight into whether supplementation is necessary or desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with magnesium’s benefits for the brain, moderation remains key. Too little can have negative effects, and too much might be just as troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to recommended guidelines and reputable products helps ensure safety. In the end, paying closer attention to minerals like magnesium might be a game-changer for those aiming to stay mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20152124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:27:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOOXJ3OGhfaHRJb1lvT01xY1pSVFd6MzE5Q1NwTVFra1VoYlZMRGlSSVZGYVJqWEhqaFVTVW9WS3JySjVUVkFRaEp2WnIwb3E3cjN1WUpkdm9uYnd1MEk4ck5Wak5KU1AyY0kzOHl6TU9COWQtbjhKRUpNaHlGTWl6RmttUEkzcnREX1g2Z3dqREtIdG4yQXlwQTJBOFJEckxSU0hoSzBRSFZJZWEtTGpF</guid></item><item><title>Minnesota to start testing raw cow milk for bird flu - Bring Me The News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNU3FkSjFacnpCTE90YVptTG1TRV8tM1VmVTZVaWtuMEtjdkV6Xzk4MmtsaURNSWpvUnVnTHFPZ1puX3BqcV95TE90VmJSV1ZpRGNyb09yVmtNZlpvdEN6dkpBWVJqYVZiM19LaTZxZ3FmSDI2M1BLTG5ObzdWNjZ3UGlDbVl0bmFGV2hXdlJRWE5IWnB6bXpudmNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:05:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNU3FkSjFacnpCTE90YVptTG1TRV8tM1VmVTZVaWtuMEtjdkV6Xzk4MmtsaURNSWpvUnVnTHFPZ1puX3BqcV95TE90VmJSV1ZpRGNyb09yVmtNZlpvdEN6dkpBWVJqYVZiM19LaTZxZ3FmSDI2M1BLTG5ObzdWNjZ3UGlDbVl0bmFGV2hXdlJRWE5IWnB6bXpudmNB</guid></item><item><title>Ebola outbreak: Uganda discharges patients after recovery - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBObUY3NGVkc3lvUlZ3N3k2QzRWcHMzanFHcmlIQ0dCWGtfekFURmVERTRhOFVxTWZpV3dtbmI2SllqNENjODcxcUYzdXlfc05PbmZhYUZxOW1Bd9IBX0FVX3lxTE4zVnV5MDRkOGZQdHVLMWFaMjZCTjJYUG5RdjZ4dnYzN1dmMWpSVEU5QkZINVEzSEpXOTdJb2dKNWdYVk14Q1Y5WXdZaVEzZ3BmMWxEVnBiT19MNjBiNUw4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Uganda has discharged eight patients who have recovered from the Sudan strain of Ebola after they tested negative twice, health officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The disease has killed one person and infected eight others since an outbreak was reported last month, but 265 people, who were listed for monitoring, remain in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues.

But the role the factors play and how much they influence disease development and premature death might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Socioeconomics and lifestyle have more to do with healthy aging than genetics, according to a big new international study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" target="_blank" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that says both lifestyle choices and living conditions are significantly more important than genetics to living a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the study, of 25 independent exposures associated with premature death, age-related diseases and healthy aging, “We find that the major drivers or premature death and aging in our sample are smoking, socioeconomic status and deprivation, ethnicity, physical activity, living with a partner, sleep and mental and physical wellness including tiredness, as well as early life exposures including health and body size at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They note that many factors combine to form the “environmental architecture of mortality and aging,” and each may play a very small role, but adding them up creates a “substantial amount of variation for premature mortality, far exceeding” that posed by genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Your income, postcode and background shouldn’t determine your chances of living a long and healthy life,” Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said in a news release. “But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Study-nuts-and-bolts" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Study nuts and bolts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the departments of psychiatry and anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier. They also got technical help from the China Kadoorie Biobank team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The data researchers used included extensive genetic and phenotype information on 502,505 people who were participants in UK Biobank research and data collection. They looked at 164 environmental facts and genetic risk scores for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A key part of the research was an “aging clock” that used blood protein levels to see how fast people aged. “This enabled them to link environmental exposures that predict early mortality with biological aging,” the team said in background material on the study. The measure has also been validated in large studies in China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cornelia van Dujin, St. Cross professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and the paper’s senior author, noted that instead of focusing on individual exposures and hypotheses, they used a hypothesis-free, lifetime exposure approach to see what drives disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Genes-vs.-lifestyle" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Genes vs. lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the death risk variation, while genetic predisposition “as we understand it at present” explained just 2%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 environmental factors, those with the most impact on healthy or unhealthy aging were smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity and living conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking was linked to 21 diseases, while socioeconomic factors like household income, employment and home ownership were linked to 19 diseases. Physical activity impacted 17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the factors, 23 could be changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including whether your mother smoked around the time of your birth and your body weight at 10 years old, influenced aging and risk of death decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposure had greater effect on lung, heart and liver disease, while genetic risk was stronger for dementias and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity. While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally,” said van Dujin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She added, “The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the approach they used made the research the “most comprehensive to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death. These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:39:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOcHdmMzdRVHJ1Ml96TVZpenREamRULXJvcndTWFJUZGhlUHZTeXFzckJmZWl2WG9rcG8zTTZCWk81bGhsVXU3Wk5JSmpQR2FnektnaTlPT1FkVjNyRFdIU1JGaTdxd0V5MkRtSVhHQ1BwSmI0dFVIN1hxeGdlcU5qaVQ0dGNYcUlCZHM3X1lScUw</guid></item><item><title>Government of Canada purchases avian influenza vaccine to protect individuals most at risk - Canada.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxPd2lwei1MenlsVmtwWFAtNl9xZmczcUg1bmpMVE1uWkw1T0JZRDJId1VQb2p2SzdjMzV0a2JjdGpfX19iZmZsaThrOU92LWlram11RnNNbm1qcVl1YkhMMXJ6dUtfQXhlT1F5VFdoTnpDb3RoRkMyemdGSmlmTVhuR3NaM3U3LVV3Mks3ZkZ1dEx2d2Z1cENfV0NVTGlac3VHMGRrdUlSYUZ4NTIxSG4yRXN5WFVhRWV4MUN5ekhzak9qU0I1R2ZmalZTLWl3RTFGNUYybnV2cFAwQVlvRTFqUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cmp-text"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;February 19, 2025 | Ottawa, ON | Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and its partners are focused on keeping people and animals in Canada safe and ensuring Canada is ready for any potential health threats. This includes taking proactive measures to protect the health of people in Canada by authorizing and securing the supply of a human vaccine against avian influenza as part of our readiness and potential use, as needed, based on risk conditions. Leveraging an existing agreement, PHAC has secured an initial supply of 500,000 doses of GSK’s human vaccine against avian influenza – ArepanrixTM H5N1 A/American wigeon clade 2.3.4.4b. This vaccine will be used as part of Canada’s contingency planning to protect people who may be at increased risk of being exposed to the virus through animals infected with avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the current risk to the public remains low, individuals with higher-level exposure to infected animals are at increased risk and should take appropriate precautions. Canada reported its first domestically acquired human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) on November 9, 2024, and continued vigilance will help prevent additional human cases. To date, there has been no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of the virus in any of the cases identified globally. However, avian influenza has the potential to cause serious illness in people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PHAC will provide vaccines to provinces and territories based on an equitable and risk-based approach, with 60% of available doses going to provinces and territories and 40% kept in a federal stockpile for national preparedness. Provinces and territories will make decisions on the potential use and administration of their respective vaccination programs in the context of local risk conditions, with PHAC supporting program monitoring and evaluation to adjust national efforts as needed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has also released preliminary &lt;a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/national-advisory-committee-immunization-summary-rapid-response-preliminary-guidance-human-vaccination-avian-influenza-non-pandemic-december-2024.html"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the use of human vaccines against avian influenza in a non-pandemic context. Based on the evolving epidemiological situation in Canada and the United States, broad vaccine deployment is not recommended at this time but the guidance provides recommendations for the possible use of this vaccine by provincial and territorial public health authorities in current and potential future scenarios to protect the health of individuals at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PHAC continues to work closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, provincial and territorial public health authorities, animal health leaders and experts, industry groups, and international organizations to prepare for and manage the global risks of avian influenza. We remain committed to protecting Canadians by continuously strengthening our preparedness for emerging issues, such as avian influenza, through proactive measures including risk assessments, lab capacity and testing, monitoring and surveillance, science coordination and expert engagement, as well as guidance for professionals and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            As a measles outbreak causes dozens of illnesses in West Texas, it’s important to know how to identify signs of the illness – especially in young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8e00043b6mpgrfqj2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles, one of the world’s most contagious infectious diseases, can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause serious complications&lt;/a&gt; – such as blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain – and even turn deadly, especially in children younger than 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00053b6mz55w2i3o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the US with measles will be hospitalized, and as many as 1 in 20 children with measles will get pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death from measles in young children,” Dr. Melissa Stockwell, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00063b6mi97omsea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, she said, it’s estimated that up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=1%20to%203%20out%20of,Behavioral%20and%20intellectual%20deterioration." target="_blank"&gt;3 out of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00073b6mdtmww55b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If a family has concerns, I urge them to please reach out to their child’s health care provider so they can talk with them and get the facts about measles and measles vaccination,” Stockwell wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00083b6mg4gp27ny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The best protection against measles is vaccination against the virus. But a &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations last school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00093b6mkse437mo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000a3b6mwv1868d1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the US has fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000b3b6mctw61y7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases in the current outbreak in West Texas are centered in Gaines County, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low: Nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000d3b6mya0a321u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early on, measles can cause symptoms that may appear similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000e3b6mll4keh6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With early measles, it’s very difficult to differentiate measles from other common respiratory illnesses. There are three signs that run together: cough; conjunctivitis, or red eyes; and coryza, which is a term for a very congested or stuffy nose,” said Dr. Glenn Fennelly, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and assistant vice president for global health at Texas Tech Health El Paso.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000f3b6m5cxexn1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you see all three of those together, that’s reason to be concerned,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000g3b6msgljts9e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other key symptoms of measles include a high fever that may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, a red blotchy measles rash and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt;, which are tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000h3b6mx9ntzh81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While some of the symptoms of measles in its early phase can overlap with other respiratory viruses like runny nose, cough and fever, typical measles cases have a hallmark rash,” which usually begins three to five days after the other symptoms start, Stockwell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000i3b6mhzjhr1pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone develops any of those symptoms, it’s important to have a conversation with their physician or medical care team before taking them to the doctor’s office, urgent care center or hospital, Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000j3b6mimcnps1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles is highly contagious. It’s best that the staff has a heads up,” he said, because the person should be “immediately isolated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000k3b6mcjqkyj8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Calling ahead allows the health care provider to make accommodations and provide guidance on how to safely see the patient while reducing the risk of measles spreading in a busy waiting room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000m3b6meshglwnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles#:~:text=Measles%20is%20one%20of%20the,for%20up%20to%20two%20hours." target="_blank"&gt;measles virus spreads&lt;/a&gt; through coughing, sneezing and breathing the same air that was breathed by someone infected with measles. The virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours – even after the infected person has left the room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000n3b6mxrxmbo4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that one person infected by measles can infect 9 out of 10 of their close contacts, if those contacts are unvaccinated. Measles is so contagious partly because an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;infected person can spread the virus&lt;/a&gt; to others even before knowing they have it – from four days before through four days after the rash appears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000o3b6mvzsuepre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The best protection is for all parents to get their children immunized at the time the immunization is recommended, and that’s starting at a year of age, with a second dose recommended around 4 to 6 years of age,” Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000q3b6me6kl56c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; has been found to be safe and effective, Fennelly said. One dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000r3b6m290azma0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials’ guidance says children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine: the first between 12 and 15 months and the second around age 4, before starting school. These two doses usually protect people against measles for life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000s3b6m0regfi9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the vaccine is not 100% effective, the more measles spreads, the higher the risk that a vaccinated person may be infected if they’re exposed to the virus. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;, and they are also less likely to spread it to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000t3b6mcgylpiwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=People%20who%20have%20documentation%20of,two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;CDC guidance &lt;/a&gt;also indicates that if someone is exposed to measles, getting the MMR vaccine within 72 hours could induce some protection or result in less serious illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000u3b6mnbv3t0oh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older children or adults can get vaccinated if they didn’t get the vaccine as a child. However, people born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected and thus already have immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20people%20born,two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you got&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the first version of the measles vaccine - a killed-virus vaccine used between 1963 and 1968 - or don’t know which type of vaccine you received, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends getting at least one dose of MMR.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000w3b6m8jslkn3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;1963,&lt;/a&gt; the virus would claim an estimated 2.6 million lives each year worldwide. In 2023, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 107,500 measles deaths, largely in countries with low vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b6ihtv00013b6m3g5cly87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, there have been recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10224336/?c" target="_blank"&gt;declines in some parents getting their children vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, driven largely by the spread of misinformation, including the misconception that vaccination may be tied to autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000x3b6mcaxrrqnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles vaccines are safe and effective. There is no validated study showing any link with autism,” Fennelly said. “That measles vaccines are safe has been demonstrated by the millions of children that have received them without complications. What parents should fear, in the case of measles in particular, is not the vaccine but the illness, which can be devastating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000z3b6mm4nsr6dq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles, but some of the complications associated with the illness can be treated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00103b6m8qaodyb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is unfortunately no treatment for measles,” Stockwell wrote in the email.

            “Sometimes measles can result in a secondary infection such as an ear infection or pneumonia that needs antibiotic treatment,” she added. “Finally, vitamin A can be an important adjunctive therapy for measles that can help protect against severe disease and some of the adverse effects of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Fennelly noted that measles is a “strongly immunosuppressive” virus, meaning it weakens the infected person’s immune system, and bacterial infections like bacterial pneumonia are a major cause of measles-related&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Children may have bacterial infections in the respiratory tract that require antibiotic treatment,” Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Additionally, “any child that’s sick enough to get hospitalized will probably get high-dose vitamin A,” he said. “Vitamin A has been shown to have a very strong impact during acute measles, and for children that are very ill, it can lead to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=In%20Asia%2C%20measles%20was%20found,Vijayaraghavan%201990;%20West%201991)." target="_blank"&gt;50% reduction in mortality&lt;/a&gt;.”

            People whose doctors say they should stay home can be treated with fever-reducing medications, rest and lots of hydration.

            “It’s important to isolate the child during the period where the child might be contagious and to stay in close contact with the pediatrician,” Fennelly said. “If a child begins behaving excessively sleepy or very irritable, those would be reasons to get back in touch with the pediatrician.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man whose genetics almost guaranteed that he would develop Alzheimer's disease by his 50s has somehow made it to his mid-70s with nary a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The now-75-year-old man, Doug Whitney, is one of only three people known to have escaped their genetic fate, sidestepping a rare form of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/alzheimers-dementia" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/alzheimers-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Caused by several gene mutations, DIAD makes up less than 1% of all Alzheimer's cases, and its symptoms typically set in between ages 35 and 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, published Feb. 10 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_9029759685897802227&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03494-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falzheimers-dementia%2Fman-nearly-guaranteed-to-get-early-alzheimers-is-still-disease-free-in-his-70s-how" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03494-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falzheimers-dementia%2Fman-nearly-guaranteed-to-get-early-alzheimers-is-still-disease-free-in-his-70s-how" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, details Whitney's case and pinpoints potential factors that may have shielded him from the neurodegenerative disorder thus far. One hypothesis is that his exposure to very high heat as a shipboard mechanic could have somehow contributed to this resilience, co-lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/jorge-llibre-guerra" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/jorge-llibre-guerra" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jorge Llibre-Guerra&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and co-first author of the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report adds to the handful of cases that are "potentially, a critical source for understanding molecular mechanisms that can slow or stave off Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-greicius" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-greicius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Michael Greicius&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher at Stanford University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/a-mans-rare-gene-variant-may-have-shielded-him-from-devastating-form-of-early-alzheimers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/a-mans-rare-gene-variant-may-have-shielded-him-from-devastating-form-of-early-alzheimers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A man's rare gene variant may have shielded him from devastating form of early Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-shocking-surprise-3"&gt;A "shocking" surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney told the research team that he thought he was one of the few who had escaped the mutations that had caused so much DIAD in his family. At age 61 — when Whitney first approached the researchers about enrolling in a large trial about DIAD — he showed no signs of Alzheimer's disease, whereas his mother and 11 of her 13 siblings had developed the condition by the time they were in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIAD is caused by mutations in three genes: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) or presenilin-2 (PSEN2). The overwhelming majority of people with DIAD only carry one of these mutations, although Llibre-Guerra said he's come across a few who carried more than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you inherit some of these mutations, you have like a 99.99% chance of developing the disease," Llibre-Guerra said. That's why Whitney was "shocked" to discover that he carried a mutation in the PSEN2 gene that should have led to early-onset Alzheimer's, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, at 75, Whitney still hasn't developed symptoms of the condition, which makes him one of three people known to have escaped near-certain DIAD, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand Whitney's apparent protection, Llibre and his colleagues used brain scans to look for the telltale signs of Alzheimer's — namely, abnormal protein clumps called amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques is an early step in the development of Alzheimer's disease, followed by an accumulation of "tangles" of tau protein. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evidence suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the interplay between these two proteins is potentially what leads to cognitive decline, although these &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/10/3969/7162122?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/10/3969/7162122?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may not be the only factors at play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney's brain turned out to be flooded with amyloid, but unlike in other DIAD patients, the tau had stayed contained within a small section of the brain. These tangles were at the back of his skull, in his left occipital lobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern adds weight to the idea that "if we prevent the downstream effects of amyloid-beta, we might delay the onset of the disease," Llibre-Guerra said. In other words, it seems like the chain reaction between amyloid and tau was somehow broken in Whitney's brain. "The question that we have is, what is preventing tau spread in this particular case?" he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation echoes what had previously been seen in another DIAD "escapee" who also had a mutation in the PSEN1 gene, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alzforum.org/member-directory/jean-charles-lambert" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alzforum.org/member-directory/jean-charles-lambert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jean-Charles Lambert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher from the Inserm Institute at the University of Lille who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="could-extreme-heat-have-been-protective-3"&gt;Could extreme heat have been protective? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few gene variants are known to protect against Alzheimer's. One example is the so-called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896199/#:~:text=APOE%20E2%20is%20associated%20with,protective%20effect%20of%20APOE%20E2." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896199/#:~:text=APOE%20E2%20is%20associated%20with,protective%20effect%20of%20APOE%20E2." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;E2 allele of the APOE gene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is associated with a very low risk of developing the disease, Lambert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the team did not find any of these known variants in Whitney's genetic makeup. Instead, they pinpointed several other variants that could be interesting to study in the context of Alzheimer's. These include one variant spotted in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56261" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56261" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPCPD1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gene recently linked to Alzheimer's resilience. Another variant, found in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/945" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/945" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CD33 gene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could warrant further research, Llibre-Guerra said, as it's involved in immune responses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also found higher-than-normal levels of "heat-shock proteins" in Whitney's cerebral spinal fluid, the liquid that cushions the brain and spinal cord. Heat-shock proteins help protect the body from environmental stresses, such as extreme heat, and could be linked to Whitney's time working as a shipboard mechanic in boiling engine rooms, the team suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that these proteins are involved in preventing misfolding proteins in the brain," Llibre-Guerra said. Like origami, proteins must be folded in a particular way to work, and Alzheimer's is a disease in which this folding goes awry. "Maybe it's preventing more tau from being misfolded and spreading," Llibre-Guerra suggested, adding that this is "just a hypothesis" at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lambert, this explanation is "highly speculative," as the evidence to support it is still very tentative. Greicius added that there are "countless other possible explanations" for Whitney's resilience against Alzheimer's, although this is an "interesting and plausible hypothesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's genetic investigation was a "reasonable first analysis," but it could have left "thousands of potentially protective variants unexamined on the cutting-room floor," Greicius added. And because this was a case study of only one person, it's challenging to identify a genetic variant or environmental exposure that may have helped him, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Greicius said, studies like this one are "useful for generating novel hypotheses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk-tfBMgzqycTCCMYqrZwMHZCN4j2ZhRmfS" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk-tfBMgzqycTCCMYqrZwMHZCN4j2ZhRmfS slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

found signs that DMT could be responsible for vivid hallucinations during near-death experiences (NDEs), which can occur when someone is close to dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14252869/paramedic-dead-11-minutes-reveals-state-absolute-tranquility.html"&gt;survivors of NDEs report these inexplicable visions&lt;/a&gt;, such as encountering a deceased loved one, seeing heaven or hearing the voice of God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team determined that NDEs share similarities with the experiences of people who have taken DMT recreationally, suggesting the brain might flood itself with this psychedelic neurochemical in the moments before death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David Luke, associate professor of psychology at the University of Greenwich in London, said there also is some evidence that DMT is released in greater quantities at the point of death in the human brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A growing body research suggests DMT may play an important role in helping the consciousness transition from life to death, causing vivid visual and auditory hallucinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luke said the only evidence of the brain releasing DMT at the moment of death has been observed in animals, but from this, experts  'can infer that this also happens [in humans].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, studies in rats have shown that their brains are capable of producing this psychoactive neurochemical, and release a flood of it just before death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a strong indication that it could be happening in humans, as cognitive phenomena in rats often translate to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But '[Animals] can have distinctly different ways of producing neurotransmitters and metabolizing compounds,' Amy Reichelt, a neuroscientist and an expert in neurodegenerative disease, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a63831340/dmt-near-death-experience/"&gt;Popular Mechanics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether the hallucinations people experience in the moments before death are actually linked to DMT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overlap between DMT trips and NDEs, however, suggests this could be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers at Imperial College London tested the similarities between the DMT state and NDEs by administering DMT and a placebo to 13 participants who then completed a validated and widely used measure of NDEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, revealed 'a striking similarity between these states that warrants further investigation,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2023 study compared the experiences of a person who had both an NDE and a trip on 5-MeO-DMT, finding striking similarities between the two events . Pictured is a model of DMT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, Luke co-authored a study that sought to learn more about this potential link by comparing the experiences of a person who had both an NDE and a trip on 5-MeO-DMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This molecule is very similar to DMT, but its psychedelic effects are not quite as long-lasting and tend to be slightly less intense, according to the Utah Patients Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luke and his colleagues interviewed this person to look for similarities between his NDE and his 5-MeO-DMT-induced psychedelic trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a very high level of comparability between the original NDE and psychedelic experiences in general, including shared characteristics such as entering other worlds, meeting menacing or benevolent entities, experiencing synesthesia, perinatal regression, and lucid dreamlike properties,' the study reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Much comparability was also identified with the 5MeO-DMT experience, in particular the major mystical experiential domains, such as ego dissolution, but especially transcendence of time and space.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers note, however, there were a few unique themes that emerged during the NDE that did not occur during the 5MeO-DMT trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those included encountering the deceased, experiencing a life review (seeing your life flash before your eyes) and seeing 'the threshold,' which can appear as a white light or gateway that represents the point of no return between life and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests these themes may be unique to NDEs. Because of these key differences, the study participant ultimately said his NDE hallucinations could not be definitively linked to psychedelics produced in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers published their findings in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1083361/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology &lt;/a&gt;in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this study challenges the idea that DMT could explain all aspects of NDEs, it still might be part of the puzzle, according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the point of death, the brain undergoes a cascade of neurochemical changes, he explained. That includes surges of serotonin and noradrenaline, which regulate mood, emotions and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DMT may be involved in these neurochemical changes too. Research has shown that this chemical naturally exists in human blood, urine and spinal fluid, so scientists believe it's possible that it could also exist in our brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers will continue to probe this neurochemical to determine whether it truly does help shepherd us toward death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I would teach them how to not be afraid to put their face in the water and because you have to be able to get to a child quickly, you have to be able to go under water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had my contacts in and I would take my goggles off and show them how to go underwater and how fun it was. My eye started to bother me pretty quickly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within two weeks I went to an eye doctor and said I was having problems and they said it was a cornea laceration and I had a crack on my cornea and they gave me some drops to take.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acanthamoeba keratitis is an infection caused by an amoeba - a single-celled organism that is found in freshwater, saltwater, soil and man-made water systems such as pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wearing lenses while swimming, using a hot tub, or shower may entrap the amoeba between the lens and cornea. The parasite can then enter the eye through a scratch or abrasion in the cornea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It starts by affecting the outermost layer of your cornea and as it worsens, the infection extends deeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said: 'I had my contacts in and I would take my goggles off and show them how to go underwater and how fun it was. My eye started to bother me pretty quickly'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her life-changing diagnosis, Cronin was hospitalized at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York on August 7 for 48 days before undergoing a cornea transplant in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped front layer of the eye that covers the iris and pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a transplant, the damaged part of the cornea is replaced with healthy donor's cornea using tiny stiches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her eye rejected the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now almost completely blind in her right eye and waiting to undergo a second cornea transplant to restore some of her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disturbing pictures show her once light blue eye now cloudy and with an enlarged pupil caused by the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cronin said of her diagnosis: 'I'm blind now in this eye with everything so it is very upsetting, it's isolating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't want to meet any new people, it gives me anxiety and I worry about what people think when they see my eye. I now have a fear of being near any kind of water. I shower with my goggles on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing her first transplant surgery on September 23, Cronin revealed that doctors also found 'high levels of parasitic activity' in her cornea that had to be immediately removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a result, she is now almost completely blind in her right eye and is waiting to undergo a second cornea transplant to restore some of her vision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cronin has worn contact lenses for nearly 20 years and claims she was never told to not wear them in the pool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cronin claims to have worn contact lenses for nearly 20 years and was never told not to wear them in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now raising awareness about her AK diagnosis in a bid to warn others about wearing lenses around water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am hopeful but fearful at the same time [about the next cornea transplant]. I'm afraid it won't take. It feels like it's never ending and I'm nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'AK is not well known and it is often misdiagnosed. I would say anyone who wears contact lenses shouldn't wear them near any body of water. Don't even wear them when it rains.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:46:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNbFo5YXlOZ0hIX2o5RUVfSk11RWl6MnpTWktwbmpES0xXaVNNV1c3azdvTFJwYlM4aGdORDlHcVhkeTNqU2t2cmZzanJ2bTJxc3RmYmpRVGhyODdmd0dRNVg3M29UQjAxX3VrYnh1cFRFbHRKQkV1X2VROV9udGNJSXNRbXFLQmRZOVJRQkZSSGxDeTZpTjhoS0tONV9UYm5pOWVwV0d4cWpodzh1dzFv0gG0AUFVX3lxTE84VFlFbFh1NlJMWWFaZFN2VXlmZ2ZWV05ZSUswaEJxcDEzNUYzSWhyaHY5T2V4a3ZTb1NFOTFZYkZGVXlXaWJ4TzVwSzQxYlNfam83V21na01jMTMyZWV2OTR4M0JOZjdHUDdjR0FDMzNmYU1Qb1VpT0dCRFY3NXVwN2ZKS1dWakp5ZTI4WGl1WHVfY2U1X2p4UmlTbUdkNGtlczlCTHBDeEpGNzU3NDBmMzNzdw</guid></item><item><title>I Lost a Pregnancy.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryv001h3b73jhj6dcwz@published"&gt;I had a pregnancy that ended in a tough miscarriage. It took many months to get over (to the extent that anyone truly gets over a miscarriage). But now, I’m pregnant again, and it’s at the point where I’m starting to tell friends.  I’m so excited to have good news to share and delight in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001i3b73jlsp5tui@published"&gt;The problem is this: one of my friends who has been a huge support to me on this journey recently shared with me that &lt;em&gt;yet another &lt;/em&gt;round of IVF had failed for her and her partner. I feel terrible, and have no idea how to tell her I’m pregnant. She’s been trying longer than I have, and I know from experience how tough it can be to hear someone’s good news when you’re struggling with your own baby journey. (That it can be “tough” feels like a huge understatement, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001j3b73gp7ht3g2@published"&gt;I can put it off for a while. We don’t text a lot, and I’m not showing yet. This is a friend I see every month or so for a big catch-up session, and the last time we hung out I simply didn’t say anything about where I was with pregnancy, and kept the conversation on other things in my life, and on what she’s going through with IVF.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001k3b73xn5rlues@published"&gt;But I can’t keep it a secret forever! I don’t want to suddenly show up with a giant baby bump at one of our hangs. But I have no idea how to share the news without potentially making her sad, which I deeply do not want to do. I’ve been through a lot, but she’s been through so much more, and I feel like if things were “fair” she’d be pregnant first!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001n3b73itpse4c2@published"&gt;As someone who has been the long-trying IVF person whose friend gets pregnant, I’m sorry to say, she is going to be sad. And that’s okay! The thing about dealing with infertility is, you know other people are going to have kids. It’s kind of unavoidable. You’re going to see adorable children in the grocery store and cry in your car. You’re going to be asked by random people when you’re going to have children (side note to all readers never, ever, ask anyone this question. It’s none of your business). And you’re for sure going to know people who get pregnant while you are trying to have a baby. It’s extremely hard and it really sucks. But what people who are going through infertility &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;want is to be left out of good things because of our infertility. That just makes us feel even more ostracized than we already do.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001o3b73mf2ebpxz@published"&gt;When this happened to me, my friend—who had also been having trouble conceiving—called me up and said, “I love you, I know this might be hard to hear, but I’m pregnant.” You need to do this with your friend. Either on the phone or in person, if you are telling people, you need to tell her. Now. It will be so much worse if she hears it first from someone else, or finds out super late in your pregnancy and realizes you’ve been keeping it from her.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001p3b739xf5k0b0@published"&gt;So yes, your friend will probably be sad, and maybe she’ll cry later, but she will also be so SO happy for you! It’s not a contest about who can get pregnant first and it doesn’t matter who has struggled more with getting pregnant. How this stuff unfolds is to some extent just random. What matters now is that you don’t expel your friend from this really happy moment in your life, just because she’s not there yet. She will probably be happy for you! And any sad feelings she has aren’t really about you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001q3b73ocyuh8js@published"&gt;One thing you can do is before you send out baby shower invitations, just give her a heads up for what is coming in her mailbox. It would also be great if you let her know that if she would rather the two of you just do a little something to celebrate, rather than have her come to a big baby party, that that would be okay. Honestly, those parties are kinda the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

It was our second pregnancy (we have an 11-month-old) and we hadn’t told anyone but my mother-in-law, who saw an ultrasound at our house by mistake. We were waiting to tell everyone after our anatomy scan at 20 weeks. The pregnancy was unplanned, but very welcome. I’m devastated, as is my husband. I was so glad we’d only told his mother, as it means not having to tell everyone about the loss. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/12/miscarriage-loss-privacy-mother-in-law-support.html"&gt;The problem is that my mother-in-law is very public with her feelings and issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, in part, because around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6396775/#:~:text=Pancreatic%20cancer%20is%20mostly%20diagnosed,several%20reasons%20because%20this%20occurs." target="_blank"&gt;90% of cases&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed when the disease is already advanced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pancreatic cancer cells also spread to other parts of the body much earlier on than in other cancers, which typically spread only when the original tumors are large. The disease typically doesn’t cause symptoms until later stages and there isn’t a routine screening for this cancer, such as a mammogram or colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once it’s detected, there are few effective treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Although we have made significant progress in improving outcomes in many of the other cancers with newer waves of cancer treatments, these have not had much of an impact in pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Vinod Balachandran, director of the Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who led the trial. “Survival rate has remained about 10% despite our best current treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That highlights the desperate need for more options, he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before mRNA vaccines became widely used for Covid, researchers had already been developing the technology for cancer treatment. This version of the vaccines teaches a person’s immune system to recognize and attack tumors, turning the immune system into a cancer-fighting machine. mRNA technology is currently being explored for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-reduces-relapse-therapy-trial-shows-rcna79543" target="_blank"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccines-frontier-cancer-treatment-rcna8886" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other solid tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To be effective, mRNA cancer vaccines have to produce a lot of T cells, a type of immune cell that protects the body against invaders. These T cells also need to last a long time in cancer patients and retain their ability to detect and fight off cancer cells. While this is a relatively straightforward feat when it comes to viruses, teaching a person’s T cells to fight nonforeign cells that their body itself made is much more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For pancreatic cancer, the task is monumental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For a vaccine to teach the body to recognize tumors, there have to be targets on those tumor cells that are unique, meaning they don’t appear elsewhere in the body. Since tumors are created from mutations, these mutations, expressed as proteins on the surface of cancer cells, serve as the targets. Pancreatic cancers typically do not have many targets to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s been a widespread belief that this lack of mutations, which serve as targets for an mRNA cancer vaccine, would make pancreatic cancer a poor choice for the therapy. But the new study showed that assumption may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial was a longer follow-up to an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06063-y" target="_blank"&gt;initial 2023 trial&lt;/a&gt; that first tested the efficacy of the vaccines in a subset of people with pancreatic cancer. Phase 1 clinical trials are very early stages of research and are meant to determine whether a certain treatment is safe and shows promise of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial included 16 patients with receptacle pancreatic cancer, meaning a surgeon can remove the tumors. This is a relatively rare occurrence in pancreatic cancer — &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-treatment.html#:~:text=Surgery%20is%20the%20only%20treatment,it%20may%20provide%20clinical%20benefit." target="_blank"&gt;only about 20%&lt;/a&gt; of pancreatic cancers are operable, which is the only treatment that can stop this type of cancer. Chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapies can shrink tumors or keep them from growing, but are not considered cures. In an even smaller percentage of people, surgery is possible without first shrinking the tumors with chemotherapy, Wolpin said. The cancer returns about half of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Balachandran and his team followed the 16 patients in the trial for up to four years. The participants first had their tumors removed sometime between 2019 and 2021. Then, the team used genetic material from each person’s tumors to design personalized mRNA vaccines they hoped would teach the patients’ immune systems to attack their cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to the vaccine, all 16 people were also treated with the current standard of care — surgery, chemotherapy and an immunotherapy drug called atezolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Half of the people in the study — eight of the participants — responded to the vaccine, producing T cells that targeted their tumors. The other half didn’t respond to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most important aspects of using a person’s immune system to fight their cancer is ensuring their response —in this case, the cancer-fighting T cells — have longevity. That way, they stay in the body, fighting off cancer cells that pop up, rather than only working for a short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the people in the trial who did mount a response, the vaccine would give their cancer-fighting T cells an average lifespan of nearly eight years, the researchers estimated. They believe that about 20% of the T cells could potentially survive and function for decades.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The longer the T cells survive, the better to protect against the cancer’s return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early trials are meant to test whether or not a treatment is feasible — in this case, if an mRNA vaccine for pancreatic cancer could produce durable T cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings suggest that it can. However, it’s still unknown whether these T cells will extend a person’s life and if so, by how much –– that is a task for the next phases of trials. Just two of the patients who had a response to the vaccine had their cancer return during the three-year follow- up, compared to seven of the eight who did not respond to the vaccine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You have to take this with a little perspective, this is not treating hundreds of thousands of people,” said Dr. Brian Wolpin, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “The fact that they were able to use a vaccine to generate a response to new mutations that come up in the tumors, and then were able to show that this subsists, is promising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because pancreatic cancer cells are adept at spreading early on, some organs may be harboring undetectable cancer cells that don’t show up on scans, meaning these tumors aren’t treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With vaccines, the immune system may be able to kill these cancer cells, as well as new ones that pop up, said Dr. Shubham Pant, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Very early on in pancreatic cancer development, “cells can escape and set up shop somewhere else –– in the liver or in the lungs. They may be quietly sitting in those other organs and then come back,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite the caveat of being a small group of patients and a very early trial, Pant said, the results are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other research teams, including scientists at MD Anderson, are working on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02760-3" target="_blank"&gt;off-the-shelf mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pancreatic cancer, meaning the vaccines have a target that is common in all pancreatic cancer tumors, rather than a personalized target based on a person’s individual tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 90% of pancreatic cancer cases include a mutation called KRAS, meaning nonpersonalized vaccines, which could be produced in bulk and would not require a piece of a person’s tumor to create, could potentially be another option down the road. (These vaccines are also currently in very early stages of research). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This gives us a little more confidence that once you get a T cell response, that it could be durable, it’s not a shock response,” Pant said. “If we can see this response stand up in bigger trials, that’s really significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:22:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQV0JKOWtfVndITnlPTVgzbkU0Nm0tV21HZWNqc0NYLWJacVBGdENyakdaby1HXzNzRlRLaEFJUTRNdklvN2xYSUNsZmtlOFQ2RUlfTHNRMVllUG9OVHFNN2dDcEdkY2FoaUY5WmtYM0FpNXdSWk5WU1VLbWUzZDNMQTdHZkh4b2x4TUhYZzFOM0tvalpWS0xjQm40TdIBVkFVX3lxTE0wRXBpdmQyMHNfYnNEdVVhMWg4LXA0ODlxbVN4ZDRIenBUd0l6Q05XNUNtOTlMM090N2VNQ0JucE9QUXVJTU80ZVB3V0xaN0JLa1BkMWFR</guid></item><item><title>Why Am I so Tired All the Time?

&lt;p&gt;Not to toot my own horn, but I like to think I live a pretty healthy, balanced lifestyle for a &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/what-to-know-about-perimenopause-in-20s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gal in her early 20s&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, I get McDonald’s delivered at the end of a night out most weekends, and sometimes I skip Pilates and pay the no-show fee to binge-watch old seasons of &lt;em&gt;RuPaul’s Drag Race &lt;/em&gt;instead. But in general, I do my best to stick to a sleep schedule, eat well, and work out a few times a week. Despite all that effort, I’m still always exhausted. I’ve lived with chronic fatigue for years, brushing it off as normal—even when I could fall asleep at a party or standing up like a horse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m 23 and have come to realize I shouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/coffee-nap-for-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the energy levels&lt;/a&gt; of an 80-year-old. So, I turned to &lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; for answers. Their micronutrient test measures three vitamins (vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folate) and three minerals (magnesium, iodine, and zinc) in the blood. Micronutrients can impact energy levels, and results from this blood test can help guide lifestyle changes. Was this finally going to clue me in on the causes of my chronic fatigue? It was time to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-chronic-fatigue"&gt;What is chronic fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from being able to fall asleep anytime, anywhere, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;other symptoms of chronic fatigue&lt;/a&gt; have crept their way into my life. I’ve also experienced brain fog, frequent dizziness, unrefreshing sleep (regardless of my trusty melatonin and white noise machine), and my muscles becoming sore very quickly. It’s important to note that everyone is different, and chronic fatigue doesn’t have just one cause. It can stem from factors like nutrient deficiencies, hormone imbalances, stress, poor sleep, or other underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on my symptoms, possible causes, and lifestyle choices, I decided the Labcorp OnDemand Micronutrient Test could provide some insight on what might be behind my daily exhaustion. The test provides detailed levels of key micronutrients I might not be getting enough of. With that in mind, I decided to give Labcorp OnDemand a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-labcorp-ondemand"&gt;What is Labcorp OnDemand?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; allows you to purchase lab testing without the hassle of needing a doctor’s appointment, so you can get insights into your health on your own time. I know I’m not the only one who’s had to wait months just to get in with my doctor for a routine check-up, so this is a major game-changer. &lt;strong&gt;However, remember that a Labcorp OnDemand test is not a substitute for consulting a provider, and you should always speak with a healthcare professional regarding your results.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re focused on improving your energy like me, optimizing nutrition, or reaching fitness milestones, Labcorp OnDemand can offer health tests designed to give you insights that will help you make this year your healthiest yet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With over 70 tests available, including hormonal, nutritional, and more, you can find a test fit for your needs and concerns. Scheduling an appointment for bloodwork is insanely easy, too—choose whatever test is best for you and purchase online, walk in, or make an appointment at one of Labcorp’s 2,000+ patient service centers nationwide for a sample collection, and get notified via email once your results are ready. And as if the ease wasn’t incentive enough, you can &lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use code EVERYGIRL to get 20% off your first test purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-my-experience-with-labcorp-ondemand-s-micronutrient-test"&gt;My experience with Labcorp OnDemand’s Micronutrient Test&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: My experience with Labcorp OnDemand was seamless and genuinely insightful (thank God). I purchased my micronutrient test online, got an appointment for a few days later at a Labcorp location that was a 15-minute walk from my apartment, was in and out of my sample collection within 20 minutes, and was notified that my results were ready via email three days later. I’m quite the busy bee, so having access to a service that took barely any time at all was a huge win. It is, without a doubt, the easiest healthcare experience I’ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the best part of it all? I actually gained helpful information from my micronutrient test. In fact, I learned I have a prominent iodine deficiency. Upon doing some research as to what this meant, I was met with the answers I’d been looking for: &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/services/conditions/iodine-deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Common symptoms of iodine deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include fatigue, muscle weakness, and memory difficulties (AKA brain fog). I also resonated with other symptoms of iodine deficiency not directly correlated with my exhaustion concerns, such as heavy/irregular periods and hair thinning. Now that I have this information, I can visit my primary care physician and learn about my options for increasing my iodine levels. This was my first step in addressing my chronic fatigue, and it’s super relieving to know there are potential answers with solutions on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-results-from-labcorp-ondemand"&gt;More results from Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For both moral support and my own curiosity, I convinced a few coworkers to take the micronutrient test with me. Here’s what they found:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steph-alleva-cornell-branded-content-editor"&gt;Steph Alleva Cornell, Branded Content Editor&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only veggies I eat come from my abuela’s sofrito, so I expected alarming results. Turns out, my only issue was low vitamin D, likely from lack of sun. Prolonged deficiency can lead to bone and muscle weakness, so I’ve added more vitamin D-rich foods—and yes, some extra veggies—just to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t usually struggle with fatigue, but as winter rolled in and the days got darker, I noticed a dip in my energy, mood, and even some hair loss. It wasn’t surprising when my Labcorp OnDemand results showed a vitamin D deficiency. Since sunny days are rare during a Wisconsin winter, I’ve started eating more vitamin D-rich foods and taking a high-quality supplement recommended by my doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been trying to conceive for two years and taking prenatal vitamins almost daily, so I didn’t think my fatigue could be from a deficiency. I was shocked when my test results showed my vitamin D levels were in the red zone. Low vitamin D can contribute to fatigue and low mood, both of which I’ve felt. I’m excited to add a new vitamin to my routine and see if it helps!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-labcorp-ondemand-tests-i-want-to-try-next"&gt;The Labcorp OnDemand tests I want to try next&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a successful first trial, there are a few more Labcorp OnDemand tests I would love to take in order to gain insight into some more of my health and nutrition woes. After moseying through their test selection, here are a few that caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://labcorp.sjv.io/DyQW7y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Women’s Health Test&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;This comprehensive test offers insights into overall wellness, helping identify if you might be at risk for common concerns like diabetes, heart disease, hormone imbalances, thyroid dysfunction, and more. As a woman, this feels like an essential next step.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/zx2gke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Heart Health Test:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An expanded heart health test measures key indicators of cardiovascular and metabolic health to help you understand your risk of cardiovascular disease and developing Type 2 diabetes.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/RG10ey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Standard Thyroid Test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; After learning my iodine deficiency might be linked to thyroid dysfunction, this test feels like a natural next move. It screens for conditions like hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which are common concerns for women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-i-m-recommending-labcorp-ondemand-to-everyone-i-know"&gt;Why I’m recommending Labcorp OnDemand to everyone I know&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I went several years too long doing absolutely zilch for my chronic fatigue. But thanks to Labcorp OnDemand being so efficient (seriously, I cannot emphasize enough how easy the whole process was) and insightful, I’m confidently headed in the right direction of feeling how a healthy, functional 20-something is supposed to. No more unwarranted yawning at pregames in 2025! Woo!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me and want to really tackle adulting by taking control of your health concerns and curiosities, I can’t recommend Labcorp OnDemand enough. You deserve to feel your best, girl! Let this be the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s just something very pure about their affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is particularly true of rescue dogs. These sweet canine companions have had to go through some difficult things in life, so when they find a loving, caring owner who gives them a forever home, they are particularly grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can absolutely feel it in this video, where an adorable rescue puppy named Cactus hugs his dad like he is a little human. We are warning you: this video is so precious that it will make your heart melt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;OMG! Cactus is such a sweet, loving boy! We are so happy to see that he has such a loving dad. It’s just so heartwarming to see him giving this type of affection to his human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though we are sure Cactus is a very affectionate pup, trying to express those feelings isn’t always easy. In the video, he made multiple attempts to hug his human dad before landing the perfect hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Cactus’ first attempt to hug his dad, he aimed a little low, and his paw landed on his dad’s lap. It was a good first attempt, but it didn’t quite communicate the love and gratitude that Cactus likely intended it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rescue-dog-finds-soulmate-pharmacy-014500699.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Rescue Dog Finds Soulmate in Pharmacy and Proves True Love Can Strike Anywhere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Rescue Dog Finds Soulmate in Pharmacy and Proves True Love Can Strike Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His second attempt was a success. Cactus managed to get his paw high enough to land around his dad’s arms as he rested his head on his chest. As this adorable boy nuzzled into his father’s chest, his human expressed his own loving gratitude for this affection and return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Aww… Are you giving me a hug,” his human dad asked. Upon realizing that’s exactly what cactus was doing, he added, “Oh, your sweet boy.” Yes, he certainly is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Internet was completely smitten with Cactus and his loving little hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people, such as TikTok user Melanie CA, were so overcome with emotion upon seeing this video that we could practically hear them weeping through their keyboard. They wrote, “Cactus is everything that is good and pure in this world!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other people, like TikTok user GDiddy1981, comment on how much Cactus loved his human dad when they wrote, “He sure loves his dad. Isn’t that the best feeling?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Bonding With a Rescue Dog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rescue dogs can be uncomfortable and distant with their new humans at first. While every rescue dog will be different, &lt;a href="https://www.rescuedogs101.com/how-to-bond-with-your-dog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forming a strong bond;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;forming a strong bond&lt;/a&gt; with them will take time. Keep in mind that these dogs often come from unstable backgrounds and that humans have not always been kind to them. It is only natural that they will be hesitant to trust their new family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That is why it is important to earn your dog’s trust. You can do this by giving them plenty of space so that they do not feel pressured by you. Part of this also means learning to understand their body language so that you know how comfortable they are at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking them for walks, offering them plenty of &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/dogs/top-10-homemade-dog-treat-recipes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tasty treats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tasty treats&lt;/a&gt;, and playing fun games with them will help you build a strong, loving bond with your dog over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, may also help people wean themselves off cocaine. A new case paper this week details a man whose cravings for cocaine significantly declined after he started taking semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctor Vincenzo Maria Romeo wrote about the case, &lt;a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05049-w"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Romeo’s patient, a 54-year-old man living in Italy, suffered from cocaine use disorder and obesity, both of which were treated successfully once he began taking semaglutide. The findings further bolster the idea that this class of medication can also be used to reduce people’s unhealthy dependence on drugs like cocaine and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other newer GLP-1 drugs are known to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;be far more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight or treating their type 2 diabetes than diet and exercise alone. Since their arrival, some doctors have begun to notice another possible but positive side effect of GLP-1 therapy: some of their patients have reported a declining urge to abuse recreational drugs or indulge in other potentially harmful compulsive behaviors like gambling or binge drinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies of this phenomenon have largely focused on alcohol and opioids. But when Romeo’s patient visited him with a history of cocaine abuse and obesity, he and his clinical team saw an ideal opportunity to see whether semaglutide could alleviate both conditions at once. With his patient’s consent, Romeo started him on a 12-week course of the GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By the end of the 12 weeks, the man had lost around 12% of his body weight, in line with typical results (10% to 15% average weight loss in trials). But he also experienced a 59% reduction in his symptoms of cocaine craving, based on a commonly used &lt;a href="https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/instrument/cocaine-craving-questionnaire-brief"&gt;survey measurement&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, the man reported improved physical health, including feeling more energetic and having less joint pain, with only mild adverse effects like gastrointestinal symptoms early on in treatment (a common occurrence with GLP-1 drugs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is, of course, only a single case study. Overall, the research looking into GLP-1 therapy for substance use disorders is also very preliminary. Researchers aren’t exactly sure how GLP-1 drugs reduce cravings for substances and compulsive behaviors, though it’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272#:~:text=As%20it%20turns,like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s."&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; that GLP-1 receptors in the brain help regulate our response to potentially addictive stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But the evidence for this unintended effect being genuine is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-case-for-ozempic-as-a-addiction-treatment-keeps-getting-better-2000513096"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/health/ozempic-alcohol-use-disorder-trial/index.html"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; findings from the first controlled clinical trial testing semaglutide for alcohol dependence; it found that people with moderate alcohol use disorder taking low-dose semaglutide experienced a significantly greater drop in cravings and drinks consumed than those on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will take more time and research to confirm the value of GLP-1 therapy for drug dependence, including studies looking directly at cocaine abuse. But for people like Romeo’s patient, experiencing obesity and a substance use disorder at the same time, semaglutide could very well be established as a potent treatment for both conditions in the near future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that semaglutide may be a promising therapeutic option for the management of substance abuse in patients with comorbid obesity,” Romeo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From diet soda to zero-sugar ice cream, artificial sweeteners have been touted as a guilt-free way to indulge our sweet tooth. However, new research &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00006-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt; shows that aspartame, one of the most common sugar substitutes, may impact vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The team of cardiovascular health experts and clinicians found that aspartame triggers increased &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin levels&lt;/a&gt; in animals, which in turn contributes to atherosclerosis—buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which can lead to higher levels of inflammation and an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was inspired by a can of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diet+soda/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt; during a project meeting. "One of my students was sipping on this sugar-free drink, and I said, 'Why don't you look into that?'" recalls senior author Yihai Cao, who studies &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; related to blood vessel disorders at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has linked consumption of sugar substitutes to increased chronic disorders like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, the mechanisms involved were previously unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers fed mice daily doses of food containing 0.15% aspartame for 12 weeks—an amount that corresponds to consuming about three cans of diet soda each day for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to mice without a sweetener-infused diet, aspartame-fed mice developed larger and more fatty plaques in their arteries and exhibited higher levels of inflammation, both of which are hallmarks of compromised cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;When the team analyzed the mice's blood, they found a surge in insulin levels after aspartame entered their system. The team noted that this wasn't a surprising result, given that our mouths, intestines, and other tissues are lined with sweetness-detecting receptors that help guide insulin release. But aspartame, 200 times sweeter than sugar, seemed to trick the receptors into releasing more insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then demonstrated that the mice's elevated insulin levels fueled the growth of fatty plaques in the mice's arteries, suggesting that insulin may be the key link between aspartame and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they investigated how exactly elevated insulin levels lead to arterial plaque buildup and identified an immune signal called CX3CL1 that is especially active under insulin stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because blood flow through the artery is strong and robust, most chemicals would be quickly washed away as the heart pumps," says Cao. "Surprisingly, not CX3CL1. It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels. There, it acts like a bait, catching immune cells as they pass by."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these trapped immune cells are known to stoke blood vessel inflammation. However, when researchers eliminated CX3CL1 receptors from one of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; in aspartame-fed mice, the harmful plaque buildup didn't occur. These results point to CX3CL1's role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/aspartame/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt;'s effects on the arteries, says Cao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Cao and his team plan to verify their findings in humans. Cao also foresees CX3CL1 as a potential target for chronic conditions beyond cardiovascular disease, given that blood vessel inflammation is involved in stroke, arthritis, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artificial sweeteners have penetrated almost all kinds of food, so we have to know the long-term health impact," says Cao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all artificial sweeteners are created &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073617?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A new study out of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; reports that one of the most popular sugar substitutes — found in diet drinks, chewing gum and low-sugar yogurt — increases insulin levels in animals, potentially elevating their risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/health/61-of-us-adults-will-have-cardiovascular-disease-by-2050-report/"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/health/how-to-prevent-a-stroke-stroke-association-issues-new-advice/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of my students was sipping on this sugar-free drink, and I said, ‘Why don’t you look into that?’” recalled senior study author Yihai Cao, who studies chronic diseases related to blood vessel disorders at the Karolinska Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some research has suggested that long-term use of artificial sweeteners may heighten the risk of stroke, heart disease and even death. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;lovelyday12 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/blog/2022/09/sugar-substitutes-may-boost-heart-disease-stroke-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some research has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that long-term use of artificial sweeteners may heighten &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/erythritol-sweetener-linked-to-increased-heart-attack-risk/"&gt;the risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and even premature death. Cao’s team wanted to explore exactly how the sugar substitute &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/29/diet-coke-sweetener-aspartame-is-possible-carcinogen-leaked-report/"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt; might cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aspartame, which is about &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;200 times sweeter than sugar&lt;/a&gt;, is sold under the brand names Nutrasweet, Equal and Sugar Twin.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Aspartame, which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, is sold under the brand names Nutrasweet, Equal and Sugar Twin. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2023-aspartame-hazard-and-risk-assessment-results-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;classified aspartame&lt;/a&gt; as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the new study, mice were fed food containing 0.15% aspartame every day for 12 weeks — that’s the equivalent of humans drinking about three daily cans of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/14/lifestyle/diet-coke-or-coke-zero-dietitian-reveals-healthiest-option/"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aspartame-fed mice developed larger and more fatty plaques in their arteries and experienced higher levels of inflammation, a major contributor to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cao’s team blamed elevated insulin levels for the arterial plaque buildup, also known as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/health/mini-health-condition-is-more-serious-than-doctors-thought/"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These photos from the study show that aspartame-fed mice (right) developed larger and more plaques (red) in their arteries (pink) compared to mice that didn’t consume the sweetener. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Wu et al., Cell Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that the immune signal CX3CL1 is especially active under insulin stimulation.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because blood flow through the artery is strong and robust, most chemicals would be quickly washed away as the heart pumps,” Cao explained. “Surprisingly, not CX3CL1. It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels. There, it acts like a bait, catching immune cells as they pass by.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cao said many of these trapped immune cells are known to fuel blood vessel inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the researchers removed CX3CL1 receptors from one of the immune cells in aspartame-fed mice, the plaque accumulation didn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00006-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Wednesday in the journal Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Cao’s team plans to verify these results in humans and further target CX3CL1 since blood vessel inflammation can lead to stroke, arthritis and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Artificial sweeteners have penetrated almost all kinds of food, so we have to know the long-term health impact,” Cao said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/health/the-healthiest-thanksgiving-foods-according-to-a-dietitian-nutritionist/"&gt;Stephanie Schiff&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Huntington Hospital, recommends cutting artificial sweeteners and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/health/cut-sugar-from-your-diet-to-lower-your-biological-age-study/"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are diabetic and find you have trouble avoiding sugary beverages, consider the sweeteners allulose, monk fruit and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/07/13/stevia-is-the-best-treatment-for-lyme-disease-researchers-say/"&gt;stevia&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/erythritol-sweetener-linked-to-increased-heart-attack-risk/"&gt;erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, a commonly used artificial sweetener that has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, try sweetening your food with fruit — or get used to consuming foods and drinks that are less sweet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen a single study that concluded that increasing sugar or artificial sweetener intake was healthy,” Schiff told The Post. “It’s worth making changes in your diet to stay healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — The latest statewide report on influenza shows Missouri has joined much of the country with very high levels of the virus as states battle one of the worst flu seasons in the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu season started a bit late, with cases increasing around the end of December, then appearing to drop, &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/influenza/dashboard.php" target="_blank"&gt;data shows&lt;/a&gt;. But around mid-January, cases began to dramatically increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It looked like it might have been possible it was going to be a mild flu season, but flu had something else in mind,” said Dr. Steven Lawrence, a Washington University infectious disease specialist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. “It really came back with a vengeance and has somewhat exploded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three weeks, reported cases of influenza tripled in Missouri from 5,086 reported the week ending Jan. 11, to 15,360 the week ending Feb. 1, data shows. The week ending Feb. 8, the latest data available, shows just a slight dip to 14,272 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of emergency department visits due to influenza-like illnesses is still on the rise across Missouri, going from 2% a few weeks ago to 4.6% the week ending Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://it.stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-departments/public-health/health-data-and-statistics/communicable-disease-reports/influenza-reports/influenza-weekly-report" target="_blank"&gt;The St. Louis County Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; said between 51 and 90 people a day sought care in emergency departments across the county for influenza-like illnesses — at times more than 5% of emergency visits — during the week ending Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the state, more than one in every three tests for flu in Missouri (35%) came back positive that week. BJC HealthCare hospitals across the St. Louis area &lt;a href="https://diorama.wustl.edu/weekly-report" target="_blank"&gt;also report&lt;/a&gt; a similar positivity rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools in mid-Missouri &lt;a href="https://www.komu.com/news/midmissourinews/flu-like-illness-shuts-down-some-schools-in-columbia/article_1bcdf140-e4cd-11ef-b700-872525228fb9.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported having to cancel classes&lt;/a&gt; the first week of February, and the St. Louis County health department reported a flu outbreak at a small private school where “control measures have been implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this season, 97 deaths from influenza have been reported in Missouri, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really to the point now where it’s the busiest, most aggressive, bad flu season since the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic,” Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there have been at least 29 million illnesses, 370,000 hospitalizations, and 16,000 deaths from flu so far this season. A total of 68 of those deaths were among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu has landed more people in the hospital in a week this season than at any time since the 2010-2011 season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. This flu season is now classified as a “high severity season” for all age groups — the first since 2017-2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some signs show a slight drop in transmission in the virus, Lawrence said experts need to see several weeks of dropping numbers before knowing if the worst is behind us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a little early to know if it’s peaked yet,” he said. “We have to be careful not to jump the gun and declare that the peak is passed because, like what happened at the beginning of the year, it fooled us. We thought it was going back down, and it just popped right back up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the peak has passed, cases will take several weeks to return to low levels, Lawrence said. It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Experts recommend that everyone aged 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no question that we’re still going to have a lot of flu transmission and potential exposures to flu over the next month at least,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at higher risk — such as pregnant women, and those over age 65 or with chronic health conditions — are urged to seek care within a couple days of experiencing flu symptoms in order to get prescription antiviral drugs that can help prevent severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint why some flu seasons are worse than others, Lawrence said. Many factors come into play, such as the weather, vaccination rates and how well-matched the circulating strains of the flu are to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccination rates drop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence said the flu vaccine is not a good match this year, and vaccination rates have also dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic in Missouri and across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data shows&lt;/a&gt; that so far this season, 42.5% of Missouri children received their flu vaccine. That is compared to 57.2% in 2019-2020. Similar trends were seen nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults ages 18 and older in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;data shows&lt;/a&gt; 43.7% received their flu vaccine this season, compared to 47.1% last season, the only previous season available. Lawrence said numbers were usually over 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah George, professor of infectious diseases at St. Louis University, said people who do not see a doctor regularly tend to miss out on getting a flu shot. The focus has also been on vaccinating against COVID-19, which was killing more people than flu until just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think vaccination rates may be down slightly just because people are, if you will, ‘shotted out’ after COVID and all the boosters and what not,” George said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed flu data from the St. Louis County health department shows that the hardest-hit age group is between ages 0 to 9, with the number of cases reported in that group nearly double that of those in next hardest-hit demographic — those in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is typical, since children tend to spend lots of time in close contact with others in day care and classrooms, Lawrence said. “They’re very much the reservoir for which it maintains transmission in the community, and then the source of the infection for many others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;George urged people to stay home from work if sick, and don’t send a sick child to school or day care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that’s not always easy to do when parents have to work,” she said. “But try and interrupt the chain of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-video  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-video tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;p class="tnt-video-container" data-provider="field59" data-projection=""&gt;&lt;video crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none" playsinline controls="controls" poster="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/4d/d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba/67956410c4c6c.image.jpg" id="video-player-d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba" class="tnt-video video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered vjs-16-9" data-uuid="d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba" data-title="US Faces 'Quad-Demic' as Flu, COVID, RSV, and Norovirus Surge, Straining Hospitals" data-provider="field59" data-duration="58" data-visible="false" data-premium="1" data-vast-url="https://tv.springserve.com/vast/850323?w=640&amp;amp;h=480&amp;amp;cb=%%timestamp%%&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmetro%2Fvideo_d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba.html&amp;amp;dnt=0"&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.m3u8" type="application/vnd.apple.mpegurl"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=" multimedia-inline-figcaption"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to nine years of data from the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01247324"&gt;OPERA I (NCT01247324)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01412333"&gt;OPERA II (NCT01412333)&lt;/a&gt; Phase 3 trials, where participants were first assigned to Ocrevus or &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/rebif/"&gt;Rebif&lt;/a&gt; (interferon beta-1a) for two years, and then they all received Ocrevus in the trials’ open-label extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on patients who’d never received any &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; (DMT) before enrolling in the OPERA studies. After nine years, nearly half of those always on Ocrevus achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3), meaning they were free of relapses, MRI activity, and confirmed disability worsening, nearly twice the rate observed in patients who first started on Rebif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These data support the use of the high-efficacy therapy [Ocrevus] as a first-line therapy in patients diagnosed with early-stage [relapsing MS], for improved long-term clinical outcomes with a favorable safety profile, similar to what was observed in the overall [Ocrevus]-treated population,” the researchers wrote. The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210142"&gt;Long-Term Treatment With Ocrelizumab in Patients With Early-Stage Relapsing MS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is an antibody-based therapy that targets the CD20 protein at the surface of B-cells, immune cells that contribute to MS-driving inflammation. By promoting the cells’ death, the therapy should ease inflammation and reduce MS activity and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy was approved for relapsing &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;forms of MS&lt;/a&gt; based on data from the OPERA trials, which showed it was superior to Rebif at reducing relapse rates and MRI lesions, and at slowing disability progression. These differences continued for more than a decade in the open-label extensions, even after the Rebif group had switched to Ocrevus, for up to nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While accumulating evidence suggests that starting a high-efficacy DMT such as Ocrevus as early as possible is better at reducing the risk of disability accumulation in the long term, there’s limited data about whether that also applies to people who are relatively early in their disease course and haven’t yet received a DMT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of first-line Ocrevus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Ocrevus’ developer &lt;a href="https://www.gene.com/"&gt;Genentech&lt;/a&gt;, and their colleagues examined data from a subgroup from the OPERA trials who were treatment-naive and had been diagnosed up to two years before enrolling in the studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 757 patients across both trials, 382 of whom were initially assigned to Ocrevus and 375 to Rebif. About two-thirds of them (67%) entered the open-label extensions and received Ocrevus until their nine-year follow-up assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observed in the main OPERA analyses, treatment-naive patients with early relapsing MS also benefited more from Ocrevus in the main trials than from Rebif. Ocrevus-treated patients were about 3.5 times more likely to achieve NEDA after two years (72.5% vs. 43.8%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were also consistently less likely to have any of the individual components of NEDA, including relapses, active inflammatory lesions and new or enlarging lesions, and 24-week confirmed disability progression, which is defined as an increase in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-prognosis-life-expectancy/#MS_Progression"&gt;Expanded Disability Status Scale&lt;/a&gt; (EDSS) scores sustained for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of starting Ocrevus as the first-line therapy were sustained throughout the open-label periods, the researchers found. For example, 48.2% of the patients who started Ocrevus maintained their NEDA-3 status for the whole nine years compared with 25.7% of those who switched to Ocrevus in the extensions. This meant that people who started Ocrevus early had a 2.7 greater likelihood of maintaining NEDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comparing disability progression, relapse rates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rates of disability progression became similar between the two groups after Rebif patients switched to Ocrevus, the benefits in the first two years were sustained through nine years, meaning the Rebif group had greater disability levels after nine years because their disease had progressed faster on Rebif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relapse rates were also significantly lower among Ocrevus patients for the whole nine years (0.05 vs. 0.09) because those on Rebif had seen a higher rate of relapses in the main trials. Similar observations were made for brain volume loss, a measure of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that the higher disability accrual and average brain volume loss observed during the [two] years on [Rebif] treatment were not recovered, even after switching to [Ocrevus], indicating that initiating treatment with [Ocrevus] earlier in the disease course is beneficial to patients,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall safety profile was similar between both groups, with no new safety signals observed during the open-label extension phase. The most reported side effects were infections, but rates of them remained low and stable over nine years of continuous Ocrevus treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results “further reinforce the use of an initial high-efficacy therapy, which can provide beneficial short-term and long-term effects on disease progression as compared with an escalation approach for patients with MS,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:46:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPY2Y1OXZmNDFobnliOWlGYjl3aDFLcW1XbHNQTU9sN1E3bnRWNmhGT2ZTZ3BXX3ZxVVd2cW5vUktKRU5NV3YybUdZblcxblVpdmZzS2UwSGoyaTlmOXpRTE8yeGlKdHczQlFEaEh0MXNJVUY4QWtfa3dDQkk0RTZCR0d4LXVDTjQ2dUhlZEdXcUh0b29fcWtjRmNWV1Mzd0h3QnhUR3Q1X3VudU9ReEpQZFVhMFVhc05SYXRFWm1TNGpKZ0RR</guid></item><item><title>People living to 100 all have the same drink 'multiple times a day' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbUpQVVpwMTFtR3dSdEVJZUN6NjhFcmNPMm13eUNFT25ocUNQcVhTamJXOWs0Y05mYUZMUUltbjBYenVfa2JIQ1dIWWdLRTRYWi1nZ0FOd1RsQUxLMWwwZ2V1elVBMVl4N180aHpSX21TSjFqRk0tNFB4NTRmaVE0NTl3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have found that individuals who live to be 100 years old often consume a popular hot beverage "multiple times a day".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers studying blue zones, regions where a significant number of people live beyond 100, are trying to uncover the secrets to longevity. They've discovered that lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, rest, and social relationships, in addition to genetics, can contribute to a longer life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Krzysztof J Filipiak, a cardiologist at the International Society of Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy, it's common for those living in blue zones to regularly enjoy cups of coffee.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctor says the drink contains polyphenols, a known antioxidant. Polyphenols also reportedly have anti-inflammatory effects and potential cardiovascular health benefits, and their presence is often associated with a reduced risk of various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8705407/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20our%20findings%20suggest%20that,release%20compounds%20with%20higher%20bioactivity." rel="nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; revealed the health benefits of coffee, as it noted: "Coffee contains human health-related molecules, namely polyphenols that possess a wide range of pharmacological functions, and their intake is associated with reduced colon cancer risk." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research went further, finding after testing responses to numerous cups of coffee to human enzymes: "Coffee was demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In fact, coffee samples inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory pathways, thus exerting potential protective effects against cancer transformation on human colon cells."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Coffee an antioxidant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)27781-3/fulltext" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, coffee ranks at sixth in a list of 50 foods rich in antioxidants. Only blackberries, walnuts, strawberries, artichokes, and blueberries ranked more highly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The journal stated: "Of the 50 food products highest in antioxidant concentrations, 13 were spices, eight were in the fruit and vegetables category, five were berries, five were chocolate-based, five were breakfast cereals, and four were nuts or seeds."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;"On the basis of typical serving sizes, blackberries, walnuts, strawberries, artichokes, cranberries, brewed coffee, raspberries, pecans, blueberries, ground cloves, grape juice, and unsweetened baking chocolate were at the top of the ranked list."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Filipiak has suggested that the impact of coffee on heart health can vary based on consumption levels. Occasional coffee drinkers may experience a brief rise in blood pressure, whereas habitual consumers might adjust to such effects, eventually managing them better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can coffee lower the risk of developing diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; Coffee is also said to improve insulin sensitivity, reducing the risks of developing type two diabetes. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066601/#sec8-nutrients-13-01144" rel="nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; says this is because it helps "liver fat oxidation". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It said: "One major site of coffee actions appears to be the liver, causing improved fat oxidation and lower risk of steatosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Another major effect of coffee intake is preservation of functional beta cell mass via enhanced mitochondrial function, lower endoplasmic reticulum stress and prevention or clearance of aggregates of misfolded proinsulin or amylin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Long-term preservation of proper liver and beta cell function may account for the association of habitual coffee drinking with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, rather than acute improvement of metabolic control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbUpQVVpwMTFtR3dSdEVJZUN6NjhFcmNPMm13eUNFT25ocUNQcVhTamJXOWs0Y05mYUZMUUltbjBYenVfa2JIQ1dIWWdLRTRYWi1nZ0FOd1RsQUxLMWwwZ2V1elVBMVl4N180aHpSX21TSjFqRk0tNFB4NTRmaVE0NTl3Zw</guid></item><item><title>Counties issue declaration of emergency support amid ongoing bird flu outbreak - WHIO</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 fQmwWk article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;MIAMI VALLEY — As the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak continues to affect Ohio farmers, two local counties have made a declaration of emergency story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[DOWNLOAD: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whio.com/mobile-apps/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free WHIO-TV News app for alerts as news breaks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Feb. 18, The Board of Commissioners in both Mercer and Darke County passed an emergency declaration of government support due to the ongoing bird flu outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRENDING STORIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Darke County experienced its first case of HPAI on Dec. 24, 2024, while Mercer County had its first case on Jan. 10, 2025, according to the resolution documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Both counties stated that the HPAI poses “a severe risk to the economic stability of the agricultural sector,” of their respective communities, creating a “ripple of effects” and impacting employment, supply chain demands, price inflation, and stability of small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Both counties also stated that the affected poultry farms are “vital to the local economy and provide essential food products to the region, state, and nation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;According to the declarations, both counties are requesting the following support from the State and Federal Governments to assist “assist in the containment, eradication, and recovery efforts related to the disease’: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to perform more testing on bars that have tested positive but aren’t showing any symptoms;

What’s more, her feline sibling has a pretty funny reaction to it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Notice how her &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cat-warming-kitty-sibling-definition-143000116.html" data-ylk="slk:kitty sibling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;kitty sibling&lt;/a&gt; averts their eyes when she begins lapping the water off of her dripping fur. They then look towards the camera, and presumably their human mom, as if to say, “I don’t know why she does this either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We would be remiss if we didn’t also point out the look that this ragdoll kitty gives the camera at the start of the video. It’s almost as if she is saying, “I know what you’re doing. Don’t judge me. I’m just trying to live my best life. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go drink water from my dripping fur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hey, we’re not judging. We were simply pointing out that this is a very interesting and hilarious quirk for a cat to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/funny-cat-joins-little-girls-180000994.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Funny Cat Joins Little Girls' Tea Party &amp;amp; He's 'Clearly in Heaven';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Funny Cat Joins Little Girls' Tea Party &amp;amp; He's 'Clearly in Heaven'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Internet had some opinions to share about this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some feline parents, such as TikTok user J, totally related to this video because they have seen their fur baby do something similar at home when they wrote, “My cat will dip her front paws in her freshly refilled fountain and splash the water around, and if she knocks it over in the middle of the night she cries until I fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other people in the comments section, like TikTok user [mod] jackie, were completely taken aback by the attitude this ragdoll cat displayed with her side eye before she dunked her head in the bowl when they wrote, “The face she makes beforehand is taking me out LOL!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, there were other people in the comments section who had a different take on the matter. TikTok user ‼PUBLIC ENEMY #1!! was of the opinion that this ragdoll cat dunked her head in the bowl because felines often struggle with depth perception. They wrote, “I've heard some cats have trouble with depth perception when their water is in clear bowls! Might be the cause, or maybe she's just silly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Do Cats Struggle With Depth Perception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Did you know that cats only have &lt;a href="https://vetexplainspets.com/what-does-cat-vision-look-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two types of color receptors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;two types of color receptors&lt;/a&gt;? They can see blue and green. Whereas humans can see red, green, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because of this, our feline companions view the world in a more limited and muted range of colors compared to us. They are much more adept at perceiving things in low light conditions thanks to having a high number of rod cells in their eyes. However, this also reduces their depth perception and makes it harder for them to notice fine details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

However, some individuals have reported chronic symptoms that developed soon after receiving a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccine. This little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;), remains unrecognized by medical authorities, and little is known about its biological underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Yale researchers have taken initial steps to characterize this condition, uncovering potential immunological patterns that differentiate those with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; from others. The findings are early and require further confirmation but may eventually guide strategies to help affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/akiko-iwasaki/"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YSM&lt;/span&gt;) and co-senior author of the study &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1"&gt;published Feb. 19 as a preprint on MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common chronic symptoms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; include &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/12/19/study-helps-explain-post-covid-exercise-intolerance"&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, excessive fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, and dizziness. They develop shortly after vaccination, within a day or two, can become more severe in the days that follow, and persist over time. More studies are needed to understand the prevalence of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/harlan-krumholz/"&gt;Harlan Krumholz&lt;/a&gt;, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YSM&lt;/span&gt; and co-senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for the study came from Yale’s &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/listen-study/"&gt;Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISTEN&lt;/span&gt;) Study&lt;/a&gt;, through which researchers aim to better understand long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. For the new study, researchers included data from 42 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISTEN&lt;/span&gt; participants who reported symptoms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; and 22 individuals who did not report any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; symptoms after receiving a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From participants’ blood samples, the researchers looked for immune features that were different between the two groups. They found several differences in immune cell populations; those with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; had lower levels of effector &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD4&lt;/span&gt;+ T cells and higher levels of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNF&lt;/span&gt;-alpha+ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD8&lt;/span&gt; T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also differences in the levels of antibodies that the body uses to target &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2. Participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; who had never contracted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2 spike protein than control participants, likely because they tended to have fewer vaccine doses than individuals without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. Fewer vaccine doses and no viral infection means the body’s immune system has had little opportunity to develop a defense to the virus, said the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers measured levels of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2 spike protein — the part of the virus that enables it to penetrate and infect host cells and what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccines use to trigger immune responses against the virus — they found that some individuals with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;, even those without evidence for infection, had higher levels of spike protein than controls. Typically spike protein can be detected for a few days after vaccination, but some participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; had detectable levels more than 700 days after their last vaccination. Persistent spike protein has been associated with long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point,” said Iwasaki. “We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz explained that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; might be similar to how different infections can cause chronic symptoms through distinct biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation,” he said. “We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers want to further validate these findings in a larger group of people “This is far from a final answer on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;,” said Iwasaki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also investigating several possible drivers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. Along with spike protein persistence, the researchers are assessing the contributions of autoimmunity, tissue damage, and Epstein-Barr Virus (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBV&lt;/span&gt;) reactivation. In the study, individuals with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; were more likely than those without the syndrome to have evidence of reactivated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBV&lt;/span&gt;, which is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also known as “mono.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeper understanding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; and its drivers could lead to better vaccines that have fewer side effects, effective methods for diagnosing the syndrome, and targets for treatment, said the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; symptoms,” said Iwasaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iwasaki is also a professor of dermatology and of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only just starting to make headway in understanding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;,” said Krumholz. “Every medical intervention carries some risk, and it’s important to acknowledge that adverse events can occur with vaccines. Our focus must remain on understanding what these people are experiencing through rigorous science and addressing the needs of those affected with compassion and an open mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts say the work highlights the importance of the “exposome” – the host of environmental exposures we encounter in life, from our living conditions to whether we smoke – for health, including how we age and why we develop age-related chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Austin Argentieri, the first author of the research at Harvard and the Broad Institute, said: “For a lot of these diseases, it’s really the environment and exposome that’s driving a lot of our risk for these outcomes, and investments in understanding and modifying our environments are likely going to have a profound impact on improving health for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Argentieri and colleagues at Oxford Population &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and other institutions report how they analysed whether 164 environmental exposures, from salt intake to living with a partner, were associated with the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7a74e936-2c07-4e17-8a10-c7e6bd243988"

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;After excluding, for example, exposures related to existing diseases, or that might simply reflect another underlying factor, the team were left with 85 environment exposures associated with the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They then carried out a further analysis, based on proteins in the blood, to identify which of these exposures were also associated with how rapidly people were ageing biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The resulting 25 environmental exposures included childhood factors such as maternal smoking around birth and whether participants were relatively short at age 10, as well as more recent factors such as whether participants were employed and their household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Alcohol intake and other aspects of diet were not among the exposures, possibly, the researchers say, because of difficulties in investigating these factors through questionnaires and inconsistencies in their associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team report that many of the 25 exposures showed associations with particular age-related diseases and biomarkers of ageing, which, Argentieri said, sheds light on the various ways they could influence early mortality. Crucially, the team stress, 23 of these exposures can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a further analysis, the team found age and sex together explained about half of the variation in risk of premature death, while the 25 environmental exposures together explained an additional 17% of the variation. By contrast, genetic predisposition for 22 major diseases explained less than 2% of additional variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The environmental exposures were also more important than genes in explaining why some people have a higher risk of developing diseases of the lungs, heart and liver in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

                    &lt;p&gt;Lupus can do irreversible harm to a person’s organs, damaging the lungs, kidneys, heart, liver and other vital organs through inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a newer lupus drug appears to protect patients from much of this organ damage, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/anifrolumab.html"&gt;Anifrolumab&lt;/a&gt; (brand name Saphnelo) reduced the risk of long-term organ damage progression by about 60% in patients with moderately to severely active lupus, researchers reported in a new study published this month in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003496725000810?via%3Dihub"&gt;Annals of the Rheumatic Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003496725000810?via%3Dihub"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anifrolumab plus standard of care (SOC) is effective at reducing organ damage accumulation and prolonging time to organ damage progression compared to SOC alone over 4 years,” a team led by &lt;a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/faculty/zahi-touma"&gt;Dr. Zahi Touma&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with lupus are typically treated using a combination of inflammation-quelling meds like steroids, antimalarials, immunosuppressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, researchers said in background notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these drugs don't stop organ damage from lupus, and in some cases might even contribute to it, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decided to see if a newer drug, anifrolumab, might better help prevent organ damage if added to the existing brew used to treat lupus patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anifrolumab in 2021 for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, the most common form of lupus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anifolumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking the receptors for type 1 interferon, a biochemical that plays a key role in promoting inflammation, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s given once a month via an IV drip, according to Drugs.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the trial, researchers compared 354 patients prescribed anifrolumab against 561 patients who received the usual care for lupus. All of these patients participated in the clinical trials that led to anifrolumab’s approval in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that people taking anifrolumab scored about 0.43 points lower on an index tracking organ damage caused by lupus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1-point increase in that index has previously been associated with a 34% increase in a lupus patient’s risk of premature death, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anifrolumab patients also had a 61% lower risk of having their organ damage get worse, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was paid for by AstraZeneca, which manufactures Saphnelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But in a small number of people, the shots may have led to a constellation of side effects that includes fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus and dizziness, together referred to as “post-vaccination syndrome,” according to a small new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some people with this syndrome &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;appear to show distinct biological changes&lt;/a&gt;, the research found — among them differences in immune cells, reawakening of a dormant virus called Epstein-Barr, and the persistence of a coronavirus protein in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study was posted online Wednesday and has not yet been published in a scientific journal. “I want to emphasize that this is still a work in progress,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s not like this study determined what’s making people sick,” she said, “but it’s the first kind of glimpse at what may be going on within these people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Independent experts noted that the findings were not conclusive on their own. Yet the results, from a scientific team known for rigorous work, suggest that post-vaccination syndrome deserves further scrutiny, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“One of the most important things is that we get some attention to really shine a light on this and try to understand exactly what it is,” said John Wherry,&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers from Oxford Population Health has shown that a range of environmental factors, including lifestyle (smoking and physical activity), and living conditions, have a greater impact on health and premature death than our genes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from nearly half a million UK Biobank participants to assess the influence of 164 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+scores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk scores&lt;/a&gt; for 22 major diseases on aging, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/age-related+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;age-related diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. The study was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the variation in risk of death, compared to less than 2% explained by genetic predisposition (as we understand it at present);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 independent environmental factors identified, smoking, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/socioeconomic+status/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and living conditions had the most impact on mortality and biological aging;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoking was associated with 21 diseases; socioeconomic factors such as household income, home ownership, and employment status, were associated with 19 diseases; and physical activity was associated with 17 diseases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 of the factors identified are modifiable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including body weight at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth, were shown to influence aging and risk of premature death 30–80 years later;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposures had a greater effect on diseases of the lung, heart and liver, while genetic risk dominated for dementias and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Professor Cornelia van Duijn, St Cross Professor of Epidemiology at Oxford Population Heath and senior author of the paper, said "Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors used a unique measure of aging (a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-proteins-blood-insights-aging-age.html"&gt;new "aging clock"&lt;/a&gt;) to monitor how rapidly people are aging using blood protein levels. This enabled them to link &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+exposures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt; that predict early mortality with biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This measure was previously shown to detect age-related changes, not only in the UK Biobank, but also in two other large cohort studies from China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said "Our exposome approach allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of the environment and genetics to aging, providing the most comprehensive overview to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts, and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, added, "Your income, postcode and background shouldn't determine your chances of living a long and healthy life. But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have long known that risk factors such as smoking impact our heart and circulatory health, but this new research emphasizes just how great the opportunity is to influence our chances of developing health problems, including cardiovascular disease, and dying prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need bold action from Government to target the surmountable barriers to good health that too many people in the UK are facing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research shows that while many of the individual exposures identified played a small part in premature death, the combined effect of these multiple exposures together over the life course (referred to as the exposome) explained a large proportion of premature mortality variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights from this study pave the way for integrated strategies to improve the health of aging populations by identifying key combinations of environmental factors that shape the risk of premature death and many common age-related diseases simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Professor van Duijn said "Studies on environmental health have tended to focus on individual exposures based on a specific hypothesis. While this approach has seen many successes, the method has not always yielded reproducible and reliable findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead, we have followed a 'hypothesis free' exposome approach and studied all available exposures to find the major drivers of disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have made a big leap forward in understanding how to provide accurate evidence on the causes and consequences of age-related diseases by combining novel computational methods with clinical and epidemiological knowledge to explore the interplay between multiple exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In an ever-changing environment, it is critical that we combine these techniques with novel advances in smart technology to monitor lifestyle and environment, as well as with biological data, to understand the impact of the environment over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of questions still to be answered related to diet, lifestyle, and exposure to new pathogens (such as bird flu and COVID-19) and chemicals (think of pesticides and plastics), and the impact of environmental and genetic factors in different populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the Departments of Psychiatry and Anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that dream recall is influenced by personality traits, sleep patterns, and even seasonal changes. People who frequently daydream and have a positive attitude toward dreams were more likely to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lighter sleep stages also increased the likelihood of waking up with dream memories, with younger individuals recalling dreams more often than older ones. The findings suggest that dream recall is shaped by cognitive and physiological factors rather than being random. Understanding these mechanisms could offer insights into mental health and the role of dreaming in consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind-Wandering and Attitude Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; People who daydream and value dreams recall them more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Stage Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer periods of light sleep increase dream recall likelihood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age and Seasons Affect Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger individuals remember dreams more, and recall is lower in winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IMT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people wake up vividly recalling their dreams from the night, and can tell precise stories experienced during the night, while others struggle to remember even a single detail. Why does this happen? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, conducted by researchers at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, and published on &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt; explores the factors that influence so called “dream recall”— the ability to remember dreams upon awakening—and uncovers which individual traits and sleep patterns shape this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there is such a difference in recalling dreams remains a mystery. Some studies found that women, young persons, or people with a tendency to daydreaming tend to better recall night dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107878"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person floating in a dream." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dream recall, defined as the probability of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience, showed considerable variability between individuals and was influenced by multiple factors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other studies did not confirm these findings. And other hypotheses, such as that personality traits or cognitive abilities count, received even less support from data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the recent COVID pandemic, the phenomenon of the individual differences in morning dream recall attracted renewed public and scientific attention when an abrupt surge in morning dream recall was reported worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, carried out in collaboration with the University of Camerino, was conducted in the years from 2020 to 2024, and involved over 200 participants, aged 18 to 70, who recorded their dreams daily for 15 days while their sleep and cognitive data were tracked using wearable devices and psychometric tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each study participant was given a voice recorder to report, every day right after the awakening, about the experiences they had during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had to report whether they remembered having dreamed or not, if they had the impression of having dreamed but did not remember anything about the experience, and to describe the content of the dream if they were able to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the duration of the study, participants also wore an actigraph, a sleep monitoring wristwatch that detects sleep duration, efficiency, and disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning and end of the dream recording period, participants were subjected to psychological tests and questionnaires that measure various factors, from anxiety levels to interest in dreams, proneness to mind-wandering (the tendency to frequently shift attention away from the task at hand toward unrelated thoughts, or internal reflections), up to memory and selective attention tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream recall, defined as the probability of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience, showed considerable variability between individuals and was influenced by multiple factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that people with a positive attitude toward dreams and a tendency for mind-wandering were significantly more likely to recall their dreams. Sleep patterns also seemed to play a critical role: individuals who experienced longer periods of light sleep had a greater likelihood of waking with a memory of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger participants showed higher rates of dream recall, while older individuals often experienced “white dreams” (a sensation of having dreamt without recalling any details). This suggests age-related changes in memory processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, seasonal variations emerged, with participants reporting lower dream recall during winter compared to spring, hinting at the potential influence of environmental or circadian factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,” explains lead author Giulio Bernardi, professor in general psychology at the IMT School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Data collected within this project will serve as a reference for future comparisons with clinical populations,” adds Valentina Elce, researcher at the IMT School and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will allow us to move forward the research on the pathological alterations of dreaming and their potential prognostic and diagnostic value”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dreaming and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#690a0100081b0847190805040c1b0007002900041d051c0a0a0847001d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chiara Palmerini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://imtlucca.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chiara Palmerini – IMT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/a&gt;” by Giulio Bernardi et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night. Yet, dream recall shows large interindividual variability. Understanding the factors that influence dream recall is crucial for advancing our knowledge regarding dreams’ origin, significance, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we tackled this issue by prospectively collecting dream reports along with demographic information and psychometric, cognitive, actigraphic, and electroencephalographic measures in 217 healthy adults (18–70 y, 116 female participants, 101 male participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that attitude towards dreaming, proneness to mind wandering, and sleep patterns are associated with the probability of reporting a dream upon morning awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of recalling dream content was predicted by age and vulnerability to interference. Moreover, dream recall appeared to be influenced by night-by-night changes in sleep patterns and showed seasonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results provide an account for previous observations regarding inter- and intra-individual variability in morning dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:26:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1oUXZBa0dtREtTbGlKcXVqTEZRRTN5TW9NWVRSal9JRTVzTUpqS1RfeEJSemxKMWFXOFNZRTE0dWtSWGlpWE1Zd2FtMFFwaDE1Wmt6R3V1emhjT0JrS3ExZng4NDdoSDNNX2NrSlBB</guid></item><item><title>Reduce cholesterol and improve heart health with 'spectacular' oil - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWDBvZG1wNU5pWDlLaFpNOS1KQWNDSVpWdHYwSkNOSXd4VllNbXdOUEZlTkRGMmtMQzNvMUJEMjRXanc3T1gzZTRwUUU2ZmJzdEFpYnNRLWZGSDJGTGlkUnluWXppbVE5anVQM0pweTRyS1h0SnppdWlacGsxZ1NSYWZCcDg2bEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where plaque builds up within the coronary arteries, restricting blood flow to the heart and preventing the heart muscle from receiving sufficient oxygen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition can be chronic, with the coronary artery narrowing over time and reducing the blood supply to the heart muscle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leading a healthy lifestyle that includes good nutrition can play a significant role in avoiding coronary artery disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A heart-healthy diet can help maintain low blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels, possibly preventing a heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2014/november/headline_376522_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Dr Bill Mullen of Glasgow University, fatty oil could be the solution to combat cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Only one type of oil was touted as good for heart health&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that, amongst the cooking oils sampled (including sunflower oil and rapeseed oil), only olive oil had a positive impact on heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr Mullen's study measured minuscule protein fragments in urine levels which, when combined, are indicators – or "biomarkers" – of heart health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteers participated in the study over six weeks and "did not know what oil they were consuming, and analysts processing the samples and the data did not know which oil was being used either", reports &lt;a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/lower-heart-disease-risk-oil-9957751" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Bristol Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mullen remarked: "The results of the study were spectacular. Both extra virgin olive oil and olive oil produced significant changes after only six weeks, a change of 0.3 in the coronary artery disease biomarker score. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Links between diet and good health are notoriously difficult to prove. This latest breakthrough in biomarker technology is finally changing that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further explained that the research proved that "only olive oil has a positive impact on heart health".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mullen emphasised the importance of consuming 20ml (four teaspoons) of olive oil daily in its raw form for its beneficial effects on coronary artery disease (CAD), regardless of whether it's extra virgin olive oil or "refined". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highlighting olive oil's historical significance, Professor Francesco Visioli said olive oil has been a staple of the Mediterranean diet for more than 70 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31037419" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Olive oil is a great salad dressing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Visioli also noted that people who adhered to the Mediterranean diet had lower overall cholesterol levels and higher levels of "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Co-author of a more recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36343558/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Miguel A Martinez Gonzalez, from the University of Navarra in Spain, highlighted the "impressive results" he found when participants replaced fats with olive oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Miguel said: "Extra virgin olive oil in particular prompted a 40 per cent reduction in type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation (BHF) acknowledged that some research on olive oil's health benefits aligns with current heart and circulatory health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, the charity questioned the evidence supporting the superiority of olive oil over other oils like sunflower, rapeseed, or traditional fats such as butter, lard, or ghee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is now widely accepted that olive oil contains compounds associated with health advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BHF advised: "Instead of taking olive oil as a supplement think about adding it to meals, for example as a salad dressing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWDBvZG1wNU5pWDlLaFpNOS1KQWNDSVpWdHYwSkNOSXd4VllNbXdOUEZlTkRGMmtMQzNvMUJEMjRXanc3T1gzZTRwUUU2ZmJzdEFpYnNRLWZGSDJGTGlkUnluWXppbVE5anVQM0pweTRyS1h0SnppdWlacGsxZ1NSYWZCcDg2bEk</guid></item><item><title>Unhealthy Diet Increases Risk for Incontinence - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOE1QTURzRG0zc2o5WktYazhDdWdsRnNxNFBfbWpqS1dTVzh3RnZQNVpBWm5Dbm9TSnBLREg5cW03Yl9ramh2MWx3RlBaVlRnYWNmb2pkRFdvV04yMFdBYXNqZzFBaGE3VzI3TlhwWnNnMTdXbkFJaGVJUVRqdmJMalFvcFFJeHZDN1BFekVGbW5OV1AwQ0t6QtIBngFBVV95cUxQcFptMU9zS2FYXy1QMkJXczdVYTZaWGpHb2VaVmpNbEdVblhOc2V3Y29ibElOVDZCVGJiMTk3d1h6MkZxdmlzckc5M19xMWZxSlNDck14aGlqRjdhTHJFUDhYVGNkVmdsV015WlgtZl9SNFFEX3hqNkFWQmE0cFgteDNsdUlHSDNkUHBwdmhDWWJBRFpXSVlfLUo4Rkd1QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A junk-food lifestyle might contribute to embarrassing little leaks in middle-aged women, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women who often munch fast food or packaged eats appear more likely to develop urinary incontinence, researchers recently reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/17455057241305075"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently eating either processed or fast food is associated with a 50% increased risk of a leaky bladder, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Higher consumption of highly processed ready-made foods and fast food increased the risk for experiencing the symptoms of stress and urgency urinary incontinence,” lead investigator &lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/mari-kuutti"&gt;Mari Kuutti&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral researcher at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, “higher consumption of fruits and overall higher quality diet decreased the risk for stress urinary incontinence,” Kuutti added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many as 45% of women worldwide are affected by urinary incontinence, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women become more likely to develop incontinence as aging affects the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to control urination, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they suspected that a poor diet might also influence the pelvic floor, as key nutrients like protein, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are important for proper muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their study, researchers tracked the health of nearly 1,100 Finnish women 47 to 55 years old. More than half already had symptoms of pelvic floor problems like urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women filled out a questionnaire that included questions related to their eating choices and behaviors, as well as any problems with incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that fast food and processed food significantly increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/which-surgery-for-stress-urinary-incontinence-is-best-for-you"&gt;stress incontinence&lt;/a&gt;, in which urine leaks out when a person coughs, laughs or does something to increase pressure on their bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly processed foods also were associated with a 40% increased risk of urgency incontinence, in which a person feels a sudden, strong urge to urinate even if their bladder isn’t full, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, eating fruit every day reduced the risk of stress incontinence by 20%, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after researchers accounted for other risk factors like the women’s body mass index (BMI), an estimate of body fat based on height and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processed and fast foods might increase the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are associated with urinary incontinence, researchers said. Fruits contain high levels of antioxidants that counteract those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a preventive action, eating behavior of women with the risk of these symptoms should be assessed, and guidance toward healthy eating patterns should be provided,” the research team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists estimate that tens of trillions of viruses live inside of us, though they’ve identified just a fraction of them. A vast majority are benign, and some may even be beneficial. We don’t know for sure, because most of the so-called human virome remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This year, five universities are teaming up for an unprecedented hunt to identify these viruses. They will gather saliva, stool, blood, milk and other samples from thousands of volunteers. The five-year effort, called the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Human Virome Program&lt;/a&gt; and supported by $171 million in federal funding, will inspect the samples with artificial intelligence systems, hoping to learn about how the human virome influences our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I think it will swamp the data that we’ve had up until now,” said Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the program’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5221746/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;first hints&lt;/a&gt; of the human virome emerged over a century ago. Analyzing stool samples, scientists discovered viruses known as phages that could infect bacteria inside the gut. Phages also turned up in the mouth, lungs and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-007-0066-x" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;later found viruses&lt;/a&gt; that infected our own cells without causing any major symptoms.

ROACH: I’m 80 and in very good physical shape. I walk 10-20 miles or more on hiking trails weekly, even though I have a pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SI37BM4D35BFTMIKNXJCRM2D2I"&gt;I fell down our stairs hauling boxes and hurt my knee. I developed a Baker’s cyst on the back of it that is the size of a tennis ball. I have gone to an orthopedic doctor and had an ultrasound and x-rays done, but nothing showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HCP2E7RF5CI5OCGWBHEKABL5I"&gt;As I understand it, a Baker’s cyst comes about because of excess fluid in the knee, but they can’t find the cause of the excess fluid. Is it a torn meniscus, arthritis, or a torn ligament like an ACL? Can I have an MRI done on my knee if I have a pacemaker?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KQSITJ2TBRAHTM4ZGL7VBMYJRY"&gt;Would it be smart to get a second opinion to find the cause and recommended treatment, like surgery? I can only walk to the mailbox, and I’m in a lot of pain. -- J.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4TNNSDGDVG33OP6DMNYENTSJ4"&gt;ANSWER: A Baker’s cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind the knee. In older adults, they are nearly always a result of knee damage. Almost every patient I’ve had with a Baker’s cyst has had osteoarthritis of the knee, but they can occur as a result of an injury, such as the fall you had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HBFZN3KBQNF7JC4SGA7T7OADLI"&gt;Many people with Baker’s cysts have no symptoms, but if they are painful like yours, orthopedic surgeons will usually try an injection.

This direct feedback loop between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus allows the brain to prioritize important sights and sounds almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the slower, previously known pathway, this circuit may help distinguish relevant stimuli from background noise, with implications for conditions like PTSD and autism. The discovery advances understanding of how the brain filters information and may lead to new strategies for treating sensory and memory-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Brain Circuit Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; A direct feedback loop connects the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, prioritizing sensory information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Learning &amp;amp; Memory Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; This pathway enables rapid tagging of stimuli as familiar or important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings could help address PTSD, autism, and memory-related disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU Langone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A newly identified part of a brain circuit mixes sensory information, memories, and emotions to tell whether things are familiar or new, and important or just “background noise.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from NYU Langone Health, the work found that a circuit known to carry messages from a brain region that processes sensory information, the entorhinal cortex (EC), to the memory processing center in the hippocampus (HC) has a previously unrecognized pathway that carries messages directly back to the EC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing online Feb. 18 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the study results show that this direct feedback loop sends signals fast enough to instantly tag sights and sounds linked to certain objects and places as more important by considering them in the context of memories and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ours is the first anatomical and functional analysis of both the new direct hippocampal-cortical feedback loop and the indirect loop found decades ago,” said senior study author Jayeeta Basu, PhD, an assistant professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The differences we found in their wiring, timing, and location suggest that the loops have separate but parallel roles that let them work together to encode even more complex information,” added Basu, faculty in the Institute for Translational Neuroscience at NYU Langone Health and a recent winner of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of the interplay between the two brain regions may yield new solutions to problems within related circuits, researchers say, like those seen in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder who struggle to tell apart past trauma from current loud noises, or in the sensory overload experienced by some children with autism as they try to tell apart objects or interact with people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicate Signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-understood model of the studied circuit posits that the hippocampus (HC) receives sensory information about the outside world from entorhinal cortex (EC) surface layers 2 and 3, but sends back signals to the EC only by indirectly wiring first into a deep EC layer (layer 5), which then routes them into EC surface layers 2 and 3. The indirect route can cause time lags that change the HC feedback signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using modern methods, the current research team found a second loop that directly connects the HC to EC layers 2 and 3, letting memories and emotions stored in the HC quickly add weight to perceived sights and sounds as part of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paradox in the field has been that there is no known direct pathway connecting the hippocampal memory center with the brain’s emotional center, the amygdala. The newfound connections to the EC may serve as a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other results of the study map connections between brain cells based on their ability to pump charged particles through channels, building up charge imbalances (potentials) along their membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the right signal, cells open their channels, enabling the particles to rush out (depolarize) under electrochemical force, with charge flows acting like switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain cells in signaling pathways “fire” as their membrane potential shift, which causes each nerve cell’s extensions (axons) to depolarize until the electric pulse reaches a synapse, a gap between one cell and the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it reaches a gap, the electric pulse is converted into a chemical signal that either turns up (excites) or turns downs (inhibits) the strength of the message passed to the next cell, with their mixture sculpting signals underlying thoughts and memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the current study measured these properties for the first time in both loops. Dr. Basu’s team found the previously known indirect loop to be excitatory, often triggering all-or-nothing signals called action potentials, large depolarizations that encode information based on their frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new direct feedback loop, however, in response to the same range of incoming signal strength, was found to recruit strong inhibition in brain cells (neurons) in EC layers 2 and 3, never eliciting action potentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newfound circuit activity instead sends small depolarizing potentials from the HC to EC layers 2 and 3. The authors say these delicate, repeated signals can combine with messages from other brain regions to make possible more intricate computations, accelerated learning, and greater plasticity, the strengthening of connections between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the research team plans to study how hippocampal output related to emotions and memories shapes decision-making functions in prefrontal cortex or the emotional coding of fear in the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will also examine what happens to their newfound direct circuit over the course of aging and in Alzheimer’s disease in study mice, and its parallels in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Dr. Basu, study authors from the the NYU Langone Institute for Translational Neuroscience were first author Tanvi Butola as well as Melissa Hernandez Frausto, Lulu Peng, Ariel Hairston, Cara Johnson, Margot Elmaleh, Amanda Amilcar, and Fabliha Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also authors were transgenic tool builder Cliff Kentros and his team members – Stefan Blankvoort and Michael Flatset, of the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; along with Claudia Clopath, head of the computational neuroscience laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College in London.

Cortico–hippocampal interactions likely mediate this interplay, but underlying circuit mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the entorhinal cortex-to-hippocampus pathway, we know little about the organization and function of the hippocampus-to-cortex feedback circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report in mice, two functionally distinct parallel hippocampus-to-entorhinal cortex feedback pathways: the canonical disynaptic route via layer 5 and a novel monosynaptic input to layer 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit mapping reveals that hippocampal input predominantly drives excitation in layer 5 but feed-forward inhibition in layer 2/3. Upon repetitive pairing with cortical layer 1 inputs, hippocampal inputs undergo homosynaptic potentiation in layer 5, but induce heterosynaptic plasticity and spike output in layer 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, hippocampal inputs to layer 5 and layer 2/3 support object memory encoding versus recall, respectively. Two-photon imaging during navigation reveals hippocampal suppression reduces spatially tuned cortical axonal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present a model, where hippocampal feedback could iteratively shape ongoing cortical processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:56:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSGdsbWRDcHI0a0oteDJtbUE1MHBuRG03ejVrTWc3NDVPQXNtQUJmRF9MYUJvU09xdndocWM3VGxNdkk5OFNRWWZVS3B0c0Q5MEJpTHpvR2FRYXFHRENFZ1VrR3lIV2JDd1lNVE5jM1ZxWERtTnhqX1Q5c1lIMVhDSnRpMEQ</guid></item><item><title>California hospitals full to the brim as US flu cases spike.

Ten of the cases were linked to influenza A, and, of 6 subtyped samples, 3 were 2009 H1N1 and 3 were the H3N2 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midwest of America has the highest rates of test positivity. Overall test positivity at clinical labs was 31.6% last week, similar to the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the new report, the CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against seasonal flu while noting that antiviral flu drugs are available for treatment and should be started as early as possible. Antiviral treatment is especially important for those at higher risk for flu complications. While general flu cases are high, emergency department (ED) visits for COVID are low and declining - and test positivity remains stable, according to the CDC.

It can sometimes include fat buildup in the arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can make the skin appear lumpy or have nodules, and can make the skin more sensitive to touch or bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a condition that only affects women, and while the NHS doesn’t know exactly how many are affected, Lipoedema UK estimates that up to one in 10 women have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 hUskxA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lipoedema affects the lower body" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-482ou5-1 dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-13844"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Lipoedema affects the lower body&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is quite common, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/"&gt;Lipoedema UK&lt;/a&gt; says there has been little research into the condition since it was first named in the 1940s, including into its causes and treatments. &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What little researchers agree on about the condition is that &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258988v1"&gt;it is very likely a genetic condition,&lt;/a&gt; with many women in the same family often affected by it. It is a hormonal condition and it usually begins to develop around puberty, around pregnancy or during menopause.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258988v1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has Love Island star Shaughna Phillips said about having the condition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Phillips shared a photo of herself on &lt;a href="/topic/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was “such a clear example” of what the condition looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How anyone can accuse sufferers of being lazy/fat is beyond me. It is a medical condition that 1/11 women suffer with, often in silence, often misdiagnosed,” she wrote in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this picture I was struggling with an eating disorder. I was underweight. I was torturing myself in the gym. Yet my legs were getting bigger and bigger. Lipoedema has nothing to do with being overweight. So damaging to continue treating women as if it’s their fault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root" data-component="Twitter" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of Lipoedema?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three stages of lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first stage, the skin can appear smooth but small lumpy nodules can be felt under the skin, which can be sensitive and easy to bruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stage 2, the skin is more visibly pebbly or dimpled, and in stage 3 larger irregular fat deposits can form around thighs and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema can cause joint pain and heaviness in the affected limbs, and in the later stages it can lead to more severe mobility and joint issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body changes caused by lipoedema can also lead to self-esteem issues, and feelings of shame, embarrassment, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dFHvfU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lipoedema can vary in severity" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-482ou5-1 dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-13845"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Lipoedema can vary in severity&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Wikimedia/Borgardottir)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is a condition that affects body fat, because the fat cells in lipoedema are disordered, dieting and exercise do not affect it the same way those measures help with normal fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while lipoedema cannot be cured with diet, it’s still good to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regime as it can help prevent the condition from getting worse, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lipoedema/"&gt;according to the NHS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there is also no cure, but there are some treatments that can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compression garments can help manage the condition for people who feel pain and heaviness from it, and they also help support the joints and can reduce swelling. Manual lymphatic drainage can also relieve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liposuction is also a treatment option, but it is not often available on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema UK says there is also a difference between cosmetic liposuction and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/liposuction/"&gt;non-cosmetic liposuction&lt;/a&gt; used to treat lipoedema, and that the cosmetic version could cause long-term damage to affected areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisation also notes liposuction was rarely a one-off treatment, and some patients would need to wear compression garments long-term following the procedure to maintain the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/liposuction/"&gt;NHS says&lt;/a&gt;: “If you're considering having liposuction for cosmetic reasons, think very carefully before you go ahead. It can be expensive, the results cannot be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. Speak to your GP about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you think you have Lipoedema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema UK says it can also be difficult to get a diagnosis because there is limited medical understanding about the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 survey by the organisation found that while 57 per cent of respondents had experienced symptoms from puberty, only 2 per cent had received a diagnosis. The majority said they didn’t get a diagnosis until after 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this Lipoedema UK says it is important for women to get an early diagnosis so they can begin to manage symptoms in the best way for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people with Lipoedema describe a feeling of relief when they receive their diagnosis, because it acknowledges that their symptoms are not the result of lifestyle choices,” Lipoedema UK says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisation suggests tracking symptoms and gathering as much information as possible about the condition before booking in with your GP, who may then refer you to a specialist service including a lymphoedema clinic - these specialist services can also help people manage lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some private clinics could also help diagnose and support people who believe they have lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNX2RwSXZ3ejcwSnNmeTNUX0w4NklvWjVyRmcwR05Cb2N4TEFTWTlOMGRhcU5kWTdxNEdZTTN2UXpMMWg5WllFeXdINHZ0WFlSb2l1V1F3X3BCUXJVck9CR0pLWjRoMzBCb0UzTTNEdjZRQmJFRjduTGxIQjVySTBQZWRqdVhMQnVJdnJ5UExxeWFDNVJZUWRNZnJScEpXd1FRRU14NWRSemlWN2tvU0hHUVdR</guid></item><item><title>Hard Turn: Getting sober-ish with Katie - KOMO News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;Curious about changing your drinking habits or exploring sobriety?

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to “triggers” that leave you feeling angry, sad or anxious — “glimmers” can swing you in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deb Dana, an author and licensed clinical social worker who specializes in complex trauma, coined the term “glimmers” in her 2018 book &lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPolyvagal-Theory-Therapy-Interpersonal-Neurobiology%2Fdp%2F0393712370%2F%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F19%2Fhealth%2Ftrauma-experts-glimmers-technique-can-help-regulate-mood%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;“The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy”&lt;/a&gt; to describe how small experiences can help shift our nervous system’s response from defense to calm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, she broke down how to recognize them — and what to do when you’ve found one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Glimmers were born from Dana’s work treating complex trauma survivors. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is a glimmer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Glimmers are these tiny moments of OK-ness, joy, excitement, ease, calm, any of those flavors that give you the feeling that you are safe enough in the world to feel present and OK,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you’ve bumped up against a glimmer?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You may feel something happen in your body, a warmth or an openness or breath change, or your eyes might focus on something. It may bring a slight smile. So there’s there’s an embodied response,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain follows suit with its own response, recognizing that something is beautiful or fun or that it likes it: “It’s a body-brain experience, and they work together,” Dana noted.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What do you do when you notice a glimmer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For beginners, Dana says that reflecting at the end of the day can help you recognize cues that moments were or could have been glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Once you know the cues, when you feel something come alive, stop in that moment and then appreciate it. Appreciation is a 10- to 20-second experience,” Dana added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This brevity makes glimmers approachable for those working through complex trauma and anyone who wants to lead a happier, more emotionally regulated life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People want to feel like they’re doing something, and yet they don’t have a lot of energy to &lt;em&gt;be doing&lt;/em&gt;,” Dana noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though they’re short, glimmers can have a mighty, cumulative effect, expanding our biological capacity to avoid fight or flight, disassociation or shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we can stay regulated, we can talk with people, to connect with people, to problem solve, to be with whatever is causing despair or disruption in the world, and find a way to work with it rather than simply be pulled into it,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glimmer: the anti-trigger&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We deal all the time with triggers, the things that disregulate people,” Dana said. “We tend to forget that we also need to actively experience moments of OK-ness in order to fully live a life of well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In effect, glimmers function not as a distraction from suffering but as a building block of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we find glimmers, when we can notice them and soak them in, it builds our capacity for staying in that biological state of regulation,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;#Glimmers has also resonated with the world, with over 27 million posts on TikTok dedicated to the hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deb Dana chose the word “glimmer” to suggest something attention-getting that is not overwhelming. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;YouTube / Sounds True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Teach your brain to feel better&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana chose the word glimmer as it suggests something attention-getting that is not overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing about glimmers is they’re all around us; there is a glimmer happening somewhere all the time, and yet we don’t know to look for them, and so we don’t notice them, and they pass us by,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we begin to understand that it’s just the tiny moment that brings a smile or stops you for a moment, you look and feel something different,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, glimmers are a few seconds of feeling something different. As you find them more and more, you build the practice; you see, stop and appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Deb Dana&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking for glimmers conditions the mind and body to experience similar moments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you find a glimmer and you feel it come alive in your body, your brain makes a story about it. It marks it, it names it. Once that happens, you are organically primed to look for more. So it becomes an easy practice,” Dana added.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She noted that there’s a fair amount of toxic positivity in the clinical world that urges people to count their blessings and eschew the negative. Yet Dana views glimmers as a way to confront difficulties rather than deny them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Glimmers are a way to resource your capacity to look toward what is difficult and distressing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It’s about building the capacity to work with what disregulates us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;See, stop, appreciate, remember and share&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people whose everyday experiences include cues of danger, distress or chaos, the feeling of being regulated and safe can register as unfamiliar, sending a danger cue to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the beginning, glimmers are a few seconds of feeling something different. As you find them more and more, you build the practice; you see, stop and appreciate,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dana views glimmers as a pathway to confront difficulties rather than an escape from them. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“As we do this, those moments of safety and connection become familiar, so they’re not scary. And your system begins to shape toward that sense of safety and connection and reduces the protection pathways. As we build the capacity for safety and connection, we can travel that pathway more easily and often,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana maintains that as we build a glimmer practice, we begin to identify glimmer environments where we are likely to experience them. She has designed the &lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324082071" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“Glimmer Journal”&lt;/a&gt; to help people keep track of and savor their glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She notes that sharing is a crucial component of the power of glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The nervous system loves to be in connection with other nervous systems. We humans are social beings. We want to be with others. And so after we see, stop, appreciate and remember, the next step is share.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;span class="embed-youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Video" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-naiAdVMzk?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&amp;amp;listType=playlist&amp;amp;list=PLyOuAoSmZkKqizFuqHjKiW83ET1uvpycD" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glimmers: Sharing is caring&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In her work with complex trauma survivors, Dana would have clients share their glimmers in myriad ways, including recordings, drawings, photographs and lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She notes that glimmer buddies and groups are lovely ways to encourage the seeking and sharing of glimmers. “There are all sorts of ways to let the nervous system really feel connected and part of a glimmer community.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to Dana, when you share a glimmer, you bring it alive again in your own system and provide an opportunity for another person to experience that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while the goal with trauma is to remember rather than relive the experience, when it comes to glimmers, we should aim for an immersive recollection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That state of feeling that there is regulation and connection, we want to bring it as fully alive as our system can tolerate,” Dana said. “&lt;span&gt;Because the more we do that, the more it &lt;/span&gt;gently and yet powerfully shifts our system towards a new pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Dana, every moment is an opportunity to shape the nervous system and remain open to the positive potential of glimmers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to have, share and remember glimmers, we know they’re shaping our systems toward more regulation, safety and connection. As I am a more regulated human, I am then passing that out into the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana added: “I’m walking through the world, giving other people cues of safety and welcome. I imagine that every time we begin to reshape our system and then pass that on to others, we’re beginning to shape the world in small but powerful ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

The medication, which can only be prescribed by a doctor, helps decrease cholesterol levels and lower the chances of developing heart disease and experiencing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in blood and cells. It's crucial for the body's normal functioning, but having an excess can increase the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol plays a key role in creating protective layers around cell membranes, producing hormones, vitamin D, and compounds that aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is carried through your blood by lipoproteins, particles made of fat and protein. There are two main types of lipoproteins - Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is known as 'bad' cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is sometimes called 'good' cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When cholesterol levels are high, plaque builds up in the arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis, and it can lead to heart problems, including blood clots, angina, coronary artery disease and restricted blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your risk is quite low, you likely won't require a statin unless your LDL levels exceed 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L). However, if your risk is significantly high, such as having experienced a heart attack before, a statin could be beneficial even if your cholesterol levels are not elevated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31036759" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's no magic solution for lowering cholesterol. You can't rely on just one food or meal to make a difference. Some individuals will need medication to control their high cholesterol. In contrast, others may benefit from making lifestyle adjustments which can help reduce high cholesterol and potentially decrease their likelihood of needing medical treatment like statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While statins are commonly used to manage cholesterol levels, various other approaches can effectively lower cholesterol. The most suitable treatment for high cholesterol varies based on multiple factors. When considering a prescription medication, a doctor will evaluate several aspects, including your family medical history, heart disease risk, and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says: "If you're at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).in the near future, your doctor will usually recommend lifestyle changes to reduce this risk before they suggest that you take statins." Lifestyle changes that can reduce your cholesterol level and CVD risk include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;eating a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;limiting the amount of alcohol you drink&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stopping smoking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, statins may be recommended if these measures do not help. Find out more about &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/statins/uses/" rel="nofollow"&gt;when statins may be recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ultimately, maintaining heart health involves regularly choosing heart-friendly foods and focusing on the overall quality of your diet.

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every meal focuses on foods that help lower cholesterol, featuring plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains such as oats and barley, plant-based proteins like beans and chickpeas, and healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and seeds. These ingredients are fibre-rich, heart-friendly fats and various nutrients supporting cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For snacks, avoid processed and packaged foods. Whole foods like fruit, plain yoghurt, nuts, and seeds are better options. You could cut up slices of carrot or cucumber to dip into hummus or roast chickpeas for something with more crunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To maintain healthy levels of 'bad' cholesterol, it's important to boost your consumption of soluble fibre in foods such as oats, beans, apples, and pears. Opt for lean protein options like fish, chicken, and tofu. Be mindful of saturated and trans fats often in processed foods, red meat, and butter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, include healthy fats like avocados and nuts in moderation, and prefer whole grains instead of refined carbs. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days, and consider incorporating strength training to enhance muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important points to remember:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's important to talk to your doctor about your cholesterol levels and any lifestyle adjustments you’re considering to find the best approach for your specific situation. Check your cholesterol regularly to monitor how your lifestyle changes affect your levels. Although some supplements, such as fish oil, might offer benefits, it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any supplement for cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although some supplements, such as fish oil, might offer benefits, it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any supplement for cholesterol management. If you choose to change your diet and lifestyle first, you will need to commit to it until your cholesterol levels drop down, and then you'll need to keep it up or risk medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natural remedies can also help lower cholesterol levels, including psyllium, artichoke extract, oat bran, garlic and barley. However, they should complement lifestyle changes rather than replace them. You can easily incorporate these remedies into your diet with your doctor's consent. Remember to keep taking any medications prescribed by your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQOXFsajJJQVZUbktYSHhKTEp2Y2pEX0JmUTlpbjhEZHNtWDl6YnF1Njh2UVdaRW5IcmhFMkY1SmdOMFdtLVNYNXV6RjdpLTZGbGdYWWpETUFXMHRCYUJmaGhwZmFncVNTckZhZ0lsZnhmY3RHaTMzcXkzRzZHd0U0N0FOaUdpdw</guid></item><item><title>Why do we twitch in our sleep? - Vox.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5EVTV6Q19hckdidlNva3RPZHJVbUQxZXFvckdyNlBULWNZN2JBSHpBU01qdTI5UW1Va0gtd0NNYnJkaVI1dUtlRGwwRmU4SHRzaUFKTktEdTFKa0Qwb0xWR1cyN1BDdlBoOGVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ever wondered what your pets are dreaming about when they suddenly kick their paws in their sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Maybe they’re chasing a mouse, or a cat. Maybe they’re pawing at you for treats. Or, maybe they’re just running around the house, rummaging through the garbage, scratching the couch, jumping on beds — all the things they’re not allowed to do when they’re awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s hard to say. But one thing is for sure: People have been connecting these sudden twitches to dreams in animals, and in humans, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In humans, during the deepest stage of sleep, we have twitches in our limbs but also in our eyes. These are called rapid eye movements, REM for short. And, the science here is pretty certain. REM sleep is when we are likely dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In animals, scientists also believe their twitching limbs is a likely sign of them dreaming as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I mean, we know we have dreams. We know that we are moving around in our dreams to some extent,” says &lt;a href="https://psychology.uiowa.edu/people/mark-blumberg"&gt;Mark Blumberg&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa. “So it just makes sense to think, ‘Oh, movements. Why wouldn’t they be connected?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But then, he observed twitching in really young animals and asked, “A newborn animal has had very little waking risk experiences. What the hell are they dreaming about?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If twitching was really related to dreaming, you’d expect that the older you get and the more experiences you have, the more you’d dream, and the more you’d twitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, to get to the bottom of this mystery, Blumberg began experimenting on newborn rats. In a study, he surgically disconnected the part of the brain responsible for creating dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We found no effect at all on twitches. And so I was like, ‘Okay, what is this about?’” If dreams were responsible for twitching, why did cutting the part of the brain responsible for them have no effect? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Blumberg spoke with &lt;em&gt;Unexplainable&lt;/em&gt; host Noam Hassenfeld about how this seemingly small question — why do we twitch in our sleep? — has fundamentally shifted how we understand the relationship between the brain and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to &lt;em&gt;Unexplainable&lt;/em&gt; wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right, Mark, just to make sure before we dive in here, when I think of sleep twitches, I think of those twitches I get, like, right when I’m falling asleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that part of this? Is that different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a separate phenomenon. It’s more akin to what’s called a startle than a twitch. You’re not in REM sleep when that happens, and there are a lot of theories about it, but the fact is it’s an extremely hard thing to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, if we’re just talking about these REM sleep twitches, then how common are they? Do all kinds of animals and people twitch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve got a website that collects all these different videos, and what you see across different animals is that the parts of the body that the animals really, really rely on for bringing sensory information into their brain are the parts that twitch the most. So for us, you know, rapid eye movements are twitches of the eyes. We also twitch our fingers a lot when we’re adults. With cats, you see their paws moving a lot. Ferrets, you see whisker twitches; rats, you see lots of whisker twitches. They use their whiskers to learn about the world just as well as we use our eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if all of these twitches aren’t just, you know, enacting dreams, how do you start figuring out what they actually are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, you know, the first thing you have to do is try to figure out what parts of the brain are producing this. I mean, how is this all happening? And what we started to see when we were recording brain activity is that the brains of neonates, baby rats, were much more active during sleep and much more active when animals were twitching than when they were awake, It’s one thing to think that sleep has brain activity associated with it. That was a huge finding 80 years ago. It’s another thing entirely to see that the brain activity is greater. And I mean much greater during REM sleep than during waking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I assume it’s reasonable to think that all of that brain activity is connected with these twitches, right? Is there a way to actually test it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, the biggest problem was methodological. How do you record brain activity in a very, very small baby rat, which was the best animal for doing this sort of work. You have to figure out how to get them in a stable situation so you can drop these very fine electrodes into the brain. And so it took years to get the methods going. But what we started to see is that every time the animal twitches, 10 milliseconds later, the part of the brain that’s responsive to sensory input for that limb shows a huge burst of activity. So twitch, activity. Twitch, activity. Not the other way around. This is a sensory signal, right? So this timing here matters. If you have a twitch, and then you get a burst of activity in the brain after that twitch, then you have a pretty good idea that that’s a sensory signal that you’re picking up on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, so like a signal the brain is getting from a nerve or a muscle or something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, the sensory input. So every time you move a limb, you have sensors in your muscle, you have sensors in your skin and your joints. And those sensors, when you have movement, they produce neural signals that flow up into the brain. That’s how we know when our arms are moving or when you touch something. We have sensors all throughout our limbs. And so when the limbs were moving, that’s when we were seeing the brain activity in parts of the brain that are responsive to those types of sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. Okay, so you’re essentially flipping the traditional hypothesis on its head, right? It’s not dreams causing twitches, it’s twitches causing dreams, or it’s twitches causing some impact in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, obviously twitches are not going to be the sole source of all things in the dreaming brain, but that it is at least providing sensory input to the brain during sleep, that we know for a fact. So it does flip it on its head and it completely changes the calculus of what’s happening in a dreaming brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So then why would the twitching be happening to begin with? Like, what’s the point of all of this twitching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, so this is where you have to start to think about what is it that’s special about twitches, right? The first thing that you notice is that the movements are discrete. And it turns out that discreteness is incredibly important. So imagine that you’re standing at a switchboard with hundreds of different switches. Let’s just say they’re neurons, and then all the wires from all of those switches lead to a whole bunch of lights. So every switch controls a different light, okay? And let’s say that those lights are muscles. If you’re sitting at that switchboard and you want to figure out which switches control which lights, you don’t just start throwing all the switches simultaneously, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Because if you did, you’re gaining no information. All you’re seeing is a bunch of lights turn on and you’ve thrown a bunch of switches. The answer is you throw one switch at a time, you see which light comes on, and then you make that connection. And so that’s the difference between wake movements and twitches. You know, I’m sitting here talking to you, and I’m gesturing, and I’m moving all my limbs simultaneously, my posture, my neck, my eyes, everything’s moving simultaneously, right? That’s waking. One of the characteristics of waking movements is that they’re continuous, and they’re simultaneous, and they’re highly complex. But when you’re twitching, one twitch at a time, you ping your body. And the body pings you back. And then you know that the first thing is related to the second thing and that’s the discreteness of twitching. And that explains why these animals are twitching so much. You never grow and develop more than you do when you are young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your theory is that the power goes out and they’re flipping switches in a fuse box to see which switch controls which light because there’s no other stimuli coming in, right? They’re in a controlled environment, so they’re essentially doing sort of an experiment to learn their own body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, exactly. It’s like they’re bootstrapping their system. They’re self-organizing their sensory motor system and it’s done from within. It’s a big mystery as to how we develop things like our sensory motor system. How do you actually learn about your body when you’re a newborn rat or a human and you’re born, you have no idea how your body is formed. You have no idea how it moves, and it’s going to be changing every single day as you grow and figure out new things, right? So how do you figure out how to move that body in real time through the process of development? You can’t prescribe this. You can’t blueprint this. There’s no genetic mechanism that can tell you exactly how you’re going to be on day three versus day five. So you need to have a system that’s highly adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if twitching is about learning, we would assume younger animals would twitch more, is that the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then, I mean, older animals also twitch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would they be twitching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Good question. First, we don’t twitch as much when we’re older. But second, some animals do twitch quite a lot. And the part of the body that twitches matters. And this is just a theory because nobody has really explored it with the level of sophistication that we need. But we have to calibrate our systems, you know, over the day we get tired, we lose control, you know, our vision gets worse and worse through the day. And then you wake up the next day and you’re rejuvenated. I think it’s possible that twitches continue throughout life, for some parts of the body, for that purpose; to calibrate a weary system. And there’s some hints out there in the world that this could be happening, including work that was done in humans. But they’re mostly hints and it needs to be done more systematically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And why do you think the scientific community missed this for so long, missed understanding twitches as a developmental process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Because when you label something as a byproduct of dreams, why would anybody spend their time studying it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like, it’s just closing off further inquiry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, I don’t want to be too flippant about it. Dreams are fascinating, but they’re kind of a red herring when it comes to studying sleep. There is, to my mind, many, many fascinating things about sleep that have nothing to do with dreams, and the focus on dreams is kind of a distraction from what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5EVTV6Q19hckdidlNva3RPZHJVbUQxZXFvckdyNlBULWNZN2JBSHpBU01qdTI5UW1Va0gtd0NNYnJkaVI1dUtlRGwwRmU4SHRzaUFKTktEdTFKa0Qwb0xWR1cyN1BDdlBoOGVn</guid></item><item><title>Drug for diabetes and kidney disease may also lower heart attack, stroke risks - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQbDhQM3hDV3RiME1hMEF2cHFDQmd2VHN3c3FrTXRjY0ZSaE5mSy1CMGF4LVl1WWUzWFcxUHlnTUtOOWdKWUROM2lyT3Q3M2lRaWlKVnB4SGlXWk4xWHVvSWdxTGh3bVBKRnFEejY1X1RCXzdDUC1FLTU2YndsZlJOeHFLWUw4MEx4ejVLSDl0enlJcXc5WFBEUDVBVUFJSWMtOXNfZmRiTDN6ZHg1b2Z0Vg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="An older adult man out in a sports field, looking to the side" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="css-90fpmc icon-hl-pinterest css-by55vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fdrug-diabetes-kidney-disease-may-also-lower-heart-attack-stroke-risks&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F02%2Fsenior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Type%202%20diabetes%20drug%20may%20lower%20heart%20attack%2C%20stroke%20risk%20by%2023%25" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;A drug already used to treat people who have diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease could have added heart disease benefits, too.

Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA&lt;/a&gt;, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and the Dr. Valentin Fuster Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw a significant benefit in terms of fewer &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and adverse kidney events.

This multi-pronged approach could lead to a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk in eligible patients who are treated with this medication.” &lt;br&gt;— Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the next steps for this research, Bhatt said that sotagliflozin should be studied in other populations at high risk for heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those would need to be large, long-term trials, so we would need to find someone to fund such research,” he continued. “In the meantime, smaller basic science experiments are ongoing to examine the biological actions of blocking SGLT1 receptors that may explain sotagliflozin’s unique ability (among the SGLT inhibitor class of drugs) to reduce heart attack and stroke risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/interventional-cardiology/ca/santa-monica/michael-broukhim-1609064880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michael Broukhim, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified interventional cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“SGLT2 inhibitors have become an important part of our treatment of patients with heart failure,” Broukhim said. “If sotagliflozin has the added benefit of reduction in myocardial infarction and stroke, we may wish to use this agent more to treat high risk patients.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with type 2 diabetes or kidney disease have significantly elevated risks for heart attack and stroke despite our available treatments.

Cases in western Texas counties have more than doubled since last week, with 58 confirmed cases and 13 hospitalizations as of yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-49649" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The majority of cases are among school-age children &lt;/strong&gt;and, according to the state health department, most of the patients are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccine status. Measles can be dangerous, &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;especially for babies and children&lt;/a&gt;, Samantha Larned of NPR network station KTTZ tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. In Gaines County, where many cases have been reported, health officials have described the communities as "vaccine hesitant." The vaccination rate there is just under 82%, compared to the state's 90% rate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As President Trump's administration pushes efforts to shrink&lt;/strong&gt; the federal government, some in China see the U.S.' cuts to pro-democracy and human rights groups abroad as an opportunity to gain more power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;NPR's Emily Feng has discovered that people with the Chinese government have approached &lt;/strong&gt;at least two U.S. human rights organizations focused on issues related to China. These individuals have offered to connect the organizations with financial backers based in China. The groups at risk of losing their funding include those that China and other authoritarian governments criticize, such as women's rights organizations and legal aid nonprofits. Some human rights advocates are &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;concerned about a growing alignment between&lt;/a&gt; how the Trump administration discusses democracy work and how authoritarian regimes frame the same topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been charged&lt;/strong&gt; by Brazil's attorney general with attempting to overturn the country's 2022 election. Bolsonaro, the former far-right leader, is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5301208/brazils-former-president-faces-charges-over-alleged-coup-plot" target="_blank"&gt;accused of plotting a coup&lt;/a&gt; to stay in power, inciting violence and hatching a plan to poison the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;Bolsonaro has denied the allegations against him&lt;/strong&gt;, NPR's Carrie Kahn says. He also says the legal fight against him is a &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;similar strategy used against Trump&lt;/a&gt;, which he has pointed out failed. The nearly 900-page long report for the investigation is based on testimonies, phone records and plea deals with close allies of Bolsonaro. Additionally, there are hundreds of cases against rioters who were charged with ransacking the capital on Jan. 8, 2023. If convicted, Kahn says Bolsonaro faces anywhere between 12 years and four decades in prison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Broken heart syndrome is more than just a metaphorical idea. Also known as stress cardiomyopathy, the real condition can bring on a sudden and dramatic weakening of heart muscle. It often strikes after a stressful event and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/17/nx-s1-5292139/health-stress-cardiomyopathy-heart-attack" target="_blank"&gt;can be tricky to diagnose&lt;/a&gt;. Some tests performed in the ER can show the same results as someone having a heart attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 When a person has a heart attack, they have a blockage in one or more of their coronary arteries. This is a key difference from broken heart syndrome, which doesn't involve blocked arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 When the heart is weakened, blood and oxygen can't effectively circulate throughout the body, resulting in the symptoms. It is unclear why some develop this rare condition after a stressful event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 The syndrome is most common in women over the age of 50, though cardiologists have reported seeing the condition in a broad range of patients. Most patients make a full recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The IRS started accepting tax returns on Jan. 27. Within the first week of filing, around 28% of the 11.7 million returns processed resulted in direct deposit refunds. By the April 15 federal deadline, the agency expects to receive over 140 million individual returns.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Cornelia van Duijn, an expert in epidemiology and senior author of the paper, said the research demonstrated the power policy could have other factors that influence our health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate ageing early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that previous work in this field has tended to focus on one specific lifestyle factor, like smoking, rather than a range of factors working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analysed levels of protein in volunteers' blood to assess how people were ageing biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can show a person is ageing faster than their chronological age, the number of birthdays they've had, would suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation said: ‘Your income, postcode and background shouldn’t determine your chances of living a long and healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We urgently need bold action from Government to target the surmountable barriers to good health that too many people in the UK are facing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Felicity Gavins, an expert in pharmacology at Brunel University of London, also welcomed the 'exciting study'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that most of the risk factors identified are modifiable highlights an enormous opportunity for prevention,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By addressing social inequalities, promoting healthy behaviours and reducing harmful exposures, we can really make a meaningful difference in reducing age-related diseases and premature mortality.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stephen Burgess, an expert in biostatistics at the University of Cambridge, added: '(The study) provides further demonstration supporting previous research that, in the majority of cases, our genes do not determine our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are exceptions, including rare conditions that are caused by a single genetic variation, but for the majority of conditions that Western people die from, disease risk is more strongly attributable to modifiable risk factors and our wider environment, as shaped by our upbringing and choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Genetics can load the dice, but it is up to us how we play our hand.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has a number of limitations critically that it was observational meaning it cannot be proven any particular factor influenced an individual's chance of suffering from a condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results come just a day after concerning research suggested bulging waistlines in England have caused the country's&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409773/England-life-expectancy-rankings-calculator-long-live.html"&gt; life expectancy to plunge in the European life expectancy rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After decades of progress, attempts to keep people living longer are beginning to fail, with people in England now living roughly nine months less than they did in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Is This the Tipping Point to Slash Salt in Our Diet - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOM1hrejFVVkNfbFZZdm42eGhPaTJhSWZpM0hwc2M5RHVldHJ2WmZ4Z1RGNGFRV0dGbjhXaC12MjBMNTNOc1BEbTAydXZPQ3h0V3NEcEtSS05QbzdTVVNUZXliZ3JBNGhFRHVCQkNBdWpEcWd3bGhzbktVNzI4MExsUVNnazJhTFJYRFhMVG9YQVlCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teaspoon of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the amount of sodium that US dietary guidelines recommend that people consume a day. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet"&gt;salt consumption&lt;/a&gt; is often higher than the recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression of evidence about the effect of salt on cardiovascular health has marched forward from studies showing a reduction in consumption associated with lower blood pressure to clinical trials confirming cause-and-effect and now, a new incentive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data from a subset of the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2829790"&gt;Salt Substitute and Stroke Study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a salt alternative with 25% potassium reduced the risk for recurrent stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators of the randomized study led by Xiong Ding, MPH, with the School of Public Health at Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, reported that those reductions came with no greater risk for hyperkalemia, which has been a safety concern with salt substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking Double-Digit Percentage Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a 14% reduction in stroke and 12% decrease in death, "The simple intervention of salt substitution could significantly improve secondary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular health on a global scale," the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/salt-substitutes-cut-risk-stroke-recurrence-death-2025a10002w9"&gt;investigators reported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; on February 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that table salt is not the biggest problem, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet"&gt;70% of dietary sodium&lt;/a&gt; comes from eating packaged and prepared foods. The agency says it is working with the food industry "to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2829794?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2024.5417"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the new trial result, editorialists led by Daniel W. Jones, MD, with the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, call this "the tipping point" for evidence that lower sodium consumption can improve health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When skeptics are asked what it would take for mandatory sodium reductions to be enforced, the editorialists point out, the common response is "a clinical trial demonstrating that a reduction in dietary sodium caused a reduction in cardiovascular events." The new data, combined with other results, could be the proof needed to move recommendations toward requirements for sodium reduction in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, the World Health Organization released &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sodium-reduction#:~:text=For%20adults%2C%20WHO%20recommends%20less%20than%202000%20mg%2Fday,adult%20dose%20downward%20based%20on%20their%20energy%20requirements."&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommending reducing sodium intake to less than one teaspoon a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, 8 million deaths worldwide are linked with poor diet, reports the WHO, and 1.9 million of those deaths can be attributed to high sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So are we reaching an evidence-based tipping point for regulating sodium? Cardiologist Melissa Tracy, MD, a professor at Rush University in Chicago, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, "Definitively, with capital letters, a shout-out, yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health improvements in reducing sodium have been demonstrated in a number of studies, she said, and the current trial adds significant health benefits in stroke and mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you start getting into double-digit reductions in stroke, double-digit reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, major reduction in death," she said, "that's huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Trans Fat, Food Dye Moment for Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675"&gt;original Salt Substitute and Stroke Study&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2021 in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Tracy says she has made a point of telling her patients about the benefits of salt substitutes, and she shows them the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracy keeps a container of salt substitute in her office to show an example of what it looks like and that it's inexpensive — almost the same cost as regular salt — and is easy to get with groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial has also shown no adverse events from increasing potassium levels with salt substitutes, she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has to be a health regulation," Tracy added, "just as we got rid of trans fats. Just as we're trying to get colors removed from foods. Patients who have risks, specifically high blood pressure, can't even eat out without their blood pressure shooting up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracy recalls the conclusions of the authors of the 2021 study, who noted, "The magnitude of protection observed in this trial is similar to that assumed in a recent modeling study that estimated 365,000 strokes, 461,000 premature deaths, and 1,204,000 vascular events could be averted each year by the population-wide use of a salt substitute in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's "huge value to this," Tracy said. "It’s lives saved. It's quality of life improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many in the scientific and public health communities have argued the evidence has been insufficient to warrant new salt reduction strategies — including the use of government regulation to limit sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Laffin, MD, a cardiologist with the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, says he would welcome government restrictions on the amounts of sodium in foods, but he doesn't see that happening anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings from the subset of this trial add to the evidence, there are still some questions science hasn't answered yet, said Laffin, who is co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always going to be concerns about what to substitute sodium with, he pointed out. "In this trial, it's potassium chloride. It does have potential dangers, particularly in people with kidney disease and other issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we're at a point where the FDA would ever legislate this," he said, adding that the agency has supported voluntary reduction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Education About Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major sodium studies, including this latest one, have been conducted in countries outside the United States, Laffin pointed out. "You have to remember that Asian populations have a much higher amount of sodium in their diets than a typical North American population," he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has the &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/salt-consumption-by-country"&gt;world's highest consumption&lt;/a&gt; of sodium, and the average daily sodium consumption among Chinese adults is more than two teaspoons of salt a day, even though Chinese Dietary Guidelines recommend well &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-023-00861-7"&gt;under a teaspoon&lt;/a&gt; a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is the effect going to be as prominent in a North American population? It's unknown," Laffin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Salt reduction is the number one thing we should be talking about to our patients at high cardiovascular risk, particularly those with hypertension," he said. "But I think it would take more than [the new research findings] to legislate in the United States that manufacturers must have low sodium content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium is so ubiquitous in the US food supply that limiting it "would be very challenging to do. A typical piece of bread has sodium in it," Laffin added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done is better consumer education for making food choices, he said. In his practice, Laffin says he asks patients whether they track the amount of salt they are eating, and a common response he hears is that they don't add sodium from the saltshaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But less than about 3% of the average person's daily sodium intake is from the saltshaker," he said. "It's mostly in the things we're eating, be it bread or cheeses or salad dressings." And "we know that anything from the deli counter is just jam-packed with sodium." Laffin says he reminds patients that reading labels is crucial in tracking salt consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also giving patients a quantifiable number to aim for with daily sodium intake, rather than instructing them to just watch their salt, will help, he says. They may think that by avoiding foods like chips and pizza, they are doing enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says giving patients a bit of wiggle room may help them better adhere to a healthy plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association reports the ideal amount of sodium for at-risk patients is about half a teaspoon a day or 1500 mg, which is even lower than typical dietary guidelines, Laffin points out. "That's great if someone can achieve that, but 2300 mg is also a reasonable target because the difference in blood pressure reduction between 2300 and 1500 mg of sodium is only a few blood pressure points," he said. "So you can get more buy-in from patients if it's 2300 or less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other less well-known ways to reduce salt, Laffin said, include asking fast-food restaurants to make your meal without salt and then adding it yourself, if needed, or skipping salt altogether, he said. The no-salt choice is showing up on food delivery apps as well as in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracy and Laffin declared no relevant financial relationships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOM1hrejFVVkNfbFZZdm42eGhPaTJhSWZpM0hwc2M5RHVldHJ2WmZ4Z1RGNGFRV0dGbjhXaC12MjBMNTNOc1BEbTAydXZPQ3h0V3NEcEtSS05QbzdTVVNUZXliZ3JBNGhFRHVCQkNBdWpEcWd3bGhzbktVNzI4MExsUVNnazJhTFJYRFhMVG9YQVlCdw</guid></item><item><title>Bird Flu Outbreak Continues to Spread - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNWjVHRGljOWZLYUVxRWswQjNNeHVMMjVLQjNjZnpycjdvN05CWWVReWN1ck9jV1pNczZEWnJNUEtSeVlscGUxQTVnV1BMVmY0WUxfc0hIZ19FbXdSZTM2dXBCLThtQWt2Rnkwc3c2Q2FvT1YzekZPQlRNd2hGUjhzTUNJOURwanlx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-russia-talks-ukraine-europe-invasion-rcna192544"&gt;indicated Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the United States and Russia had agreed to restaff their respective embassies. His announcement followed the first day of high-level talks between Russian and American officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine and improving U.S.-Russia cooperation. The State Department &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-russian-foreign-minister-lavrov/"&gt;laid out&lt;/a&gt; plans to pursue “historic economic and investment opportunities” with Russia after the fighting has ceased and &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-and-special-envoy-to-the-middle-east-steve-witkoff-with-jennifer-hansler-of-cnn-and-matthew-lee-of-the-associated-press/"&gt;alluded to&lt;/a&gt; the possibility of lifting sanctions on the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3299219/ukraines-zelensky-postpones-saudi-visit-not-give-legitimacy-us-russia-meeting"&gt;reportedly postponed&lt;/a&gt; a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to avoid giving the negotiations—to which he said he initially hadn’t been invited—“legitimacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Hamas negotiator on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-to-release-bibas-family-intl/index.html"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to return the bodies of four murdered hostages to Israel on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/bibas-bodies-death-hamas-israel-exchange.html"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; Shiri Bibas and her two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. Terrorists abducted the mother and children from their Nir Oz home on October 7, 2023, along with Shiri’s husband Yarden, who was separated from his family during the attack and released this month as part of the ongoing U.S.-brokered, three-phase ceasefire deal. Israel has yet to confirm the remaining family members’ deaths, but expressed “grave concerns” about their status last month. Kfir was the youngest abductee at just 9 months old at the time of his kidnapping. Hamas also &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-to-release-6-living-hostages-on-saturday-after-returning-4-bodies-thursday/"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it would free the six remaining living hostages slated for release in the first stage of the deal on Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;

Elon Musk’s commission has in recent weeks &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/treasury-inspector-general-audit-doge-musk-democrats-d1e2710d0b63f54a8c1fe50fe4f23d4d"&gt;accessed&lt;/a&gt; the Treasury Department’s payment system and is now &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/musk-irs-doge.html"&gt;attempting&lt;/a&gt; to obtain sensitive taxpayer data at the Internal Revenue Service as part of DOGE’s ostensible push to audit the federal government. With King’s departure, the White House &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/social-security-head-steps-down-doge-access/index.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; appointed SSA employee Leland Dudek to take over as acting commissioner of the independent agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postmaster General Louis DeJoy &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-steps-down-a064a797"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday to resign from his position atop the U.S. Postal Service, though he didn’t specify the date of his departure. DeJoy’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/19/trump-louis-dejoy-usps/"&gt;followed reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration was looking into candidates to replace him, though the postmaster general is typically chosen by an independent governing board. President Donald Trump had also floated the possibility of privatizing the federal agency, which &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usps-lost-almost-10-billion-2024-postmaster-louis-dejoy-postage/#:~:text=The%20USPS%20said%20it%20lost,noncash%20contributions%20to%20worker%20compensation."&gt;lost $9.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 fiscal year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Jones, the head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food division, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-food-division-head-jim-jones-resigns-rcna192589"&gt;resigned from his post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in response to the Trump administration’s sweeping layoffs. Of the 2,000 employees in his division, 89 people—including new staffers hired to investigate the risk of chemicals in the food industry—were affected by cuts that Jones &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/food-head-at-fda-resigns-citing-numerous-job-cuts-in-division"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as “indiscriminate” in a resignation letter. “The secretary’s comments impugning the integrity of the food staff, asserting they are corrupt based on falsities, is a disservice to everyone,” he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/fda-food-safety-jim-jones-resignation.html"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; of newly confirmed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s past &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/health/robert-kennedy-jr-fda.html"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the FDA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/howard-lutnick-confirmed-commerce.html"&gt;voted 51-45&lt;/a&gt; along party lines on Tuesday to confirm Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary. The former CEO of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick will be tasked with managing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/howard-lutnick-trump-tariffs-commerce-department-9788590bbee10d09d3cb91822b0c9687"&gt;50,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; as he seeks to implement President Trump’s protectionist trade priorities.

The agency also &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-january-2025-monthly-update"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that illegal crossings between January 21 and January 31 had dropped 85 percent year-over-year.

    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the January consumer price index report dropped last week, it came with more bad news for breakfast lovers: a &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/why-are-eggs-so-expensive"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; for egg prices, which hit $4.95 for a dozen. Grocery stores across the country have begun imposing &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/grocery-stores-limit-egg-purchases-thefts-increase-bird-flu/story?id=118732180#:~:text=Stores%20enforce%20purchase,three%20per%20member."&gt;purchase limits&lt;/a&gt;, while criminals are carrying out &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/eggs-stolen-pennsylvania-100000-c1c260ca05b9f84612c61071cb504939"&gt;egg heists&lt;/a&gt;. And according to our own Scott Lincicome’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1890826431648711000"&gt;totally scientific scale&lt;/a&gt;, we’re currently at EGGCON 3—not yet an egg-istential crisis but still concerning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit? A now-yearslong outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus, which has forced farmers to kill tens of millions of infected and exposed birds. The flu made the jump to dairy cows last spring, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/m0106-h5-birdflu-death.html"&gt;first human death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States from the virus occurred last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While health authorities maintain that the bird flu currently represents a low risk to people, researchers warn the extended duration of the outbreak increases the potential of the virus mutating and leading to widespread human-to-human transmission. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled a forthcoming change in strategy as the government response thus far comes under fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus, which is most commonly found in birds, has circulated for decades since its discovery in 1996. The virus can spread via wild migratory flocks infected with the flu, making it challenging to contain. The virus has plagued commercial poultry farms since an outbreak in February 2022, and more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html#:~:text=159%2C307%2C978,from%20clade%202.3.4.4."&gt;159 million birds&lt;/a&gt; have died or been killed to stem the spread in the last three years. Poultry farmers across the country have been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/nyregion/long-island-duck-farm-bird-flu.html"&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt; with many of them losing all of their flocks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-hpai-indemnity-and-compensation.508.pdf"&gt;compensates&lt;/a&gt; farmers for birds that are culled after an outbreak has been detected, but not those that have died from the virus—a policy intended to incentivize farmers to detect and report outbreaks as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu can also &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;infect wild mammals&lt;/a&gt; as wide-ranging as mountain lions and bottlenose dolphins, but the jump to dairy cows for the first time last year is particularly concerning to some researchers. More than &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;970 cow herds&lt;/a&gt; across 17 states have been infected with the virus. California, the nation’s largest milk producer, declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/docs/governors_proclamation_of_a_state_of_emergency_bird_flu_2024.pdf"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; in December as roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html#:~:text=California.%20Since%20California%27s%20first%20detection%20of%20H5N1%20Bird%20Flu%20in%20dairies%2C%20there%20have%20been%20a%20total%20of%20747%20infected%20dairies%20with%20297%20of%20those%20affected%2C%20fully%20recovered%20and%20released%20from%20quarantine."&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the state’s dairy herds contracted the virus. Infected dairy cows have a much lower mortality rate for the virus compared to chickens, but some cows experience reduced milk production even after recovering from the virus. Last April, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/2024-avian-influenza-ah5n1-dairy-cattle"&gt;first known case&lt;/a&gt; of mammal-to-human transmission of H5N1 came from a person in Texas exposed to dairy cows presumed to be infected with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s concerning is the spillover events to humans,” Isaac Bogoch, a tropical disease doctor and researcher at the University of Toronto, told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;68 human cases&lt;/a&gt; of the virus so far, with the majority of them stemming from exposure to infected dairy cows and poultry. But a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published Thursday and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm"&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; from August suggested that the number of human cases could be much higher due to insufficient testing and cases where individuals don’t experience noticeable symptoms. Between 2003 and January 2025, there have been 964 human cases in 24 countries, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025.pdf?sfvrsn=e1871d4c_5&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Human%20infections%20with%20avian,mouth%2C%20eyes%20or%20nose."&gt;contract the virus&lt;/a&gt; when in close proximity to infected animals if the virus gets into their eyes, nose, or mouth—most human cases have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2414610#:~:text=Of%2046%20case,face%20masks%20(47%25)."&gt;conjunctivitis&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting infection via the eyes. Very few of the confirmed human cases have resulted in serious illness. The woman who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-death-louisiana-82e4d00876e62cb2b13bb621826c84f9"&gt;died in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions. A 13-year-old in Canada with mild asthma and obesity was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; after contracting the virus last fall and nearly died, having to be intubated and placed on life support, before recovering sufficiently to be discharged in January. Last week, an elderly Wyoming woman became the &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/"&gt;third American case&lt;/a&gt; requiring hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger lies not in the virus as it is currently transmitted to humans but in potential mutations that could increase the virus’s transmissibility and virulence, threatening an epidemic or pandemic. Historically, human-to-human transmission of the virus has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;, primarily occurring within households. So far, the transmission has not been efficient enough for sustained spread, and there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission in the current outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the longer the outbreak continues unchecked, particularly among mammals, the greater the risk of mutations that could result in sustained, human-to-human spread. During flu season, researchers are concerned about people and mammals contracting bird flu and other more transmissible types of the flu simultaneously. This creates the potential for viral reassortment, wherein H5N1 could take on some of the genetic features of another, more transmissible strain. This kind of reassortment in combination with the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/h5n1-detected-in-pig-highlights-the-risk-of-bird-flu-mixing-with-seasonal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTo%20get%20from,to%20replicate%20best"&gt;right mutations&lt;/a&gt; could result in elevated pandemic risk. The CDC’s guidance &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/vaccination-farm-workers.html#:~:text=While%20a%20seasonal,an%20avian%20virus."&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt; farm workers to get the seasonal flu vaccine to reduce the chances of dual infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s significant uncertainty,” Bogoch said, “but there are arrows pointing in the direction that this certainly does have epidemic and pandemic potential.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump officials have criticized the previous administration’s response to the outbreak as ineffective and driving up egg prices. “They spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-face-the-nation-transcript-02-16-2025/"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; Sunday. The response until now, while failing to stop the virus’ spread, has followed the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai-response-plan-ppt.pdf"&gt;policy playbook&lt;/a&gt; of culling to contain. Some former public health &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/01/02/bird-flu-biden-trump/"&gt;officials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://features.csis.org/US-bird-flu-response/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the Biden administration for responding too slowly. Only in December did the USDA begin &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/12/06/usda-announces-new-federal-order-begins-national-milk-testing-strategy-address-h5n1-dairy-herds"&gt;standing up&lt;/a&gt; a national dairy milk testing regime despite &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-undercounts-bird-flu-cattle-farmers-shun-testing-2024-08-15/"&gt;earlier signs&lt;/a&gt; of a lack of testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett outlined what appears to be the concept of a plan intended to reduce the number of chickens killed. “What we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn’t have to kill the chickens,” he said. “Have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we’re working on, and we’re finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what would be involved in “biosecurity and medication” or how the administration will approach the human epidemic risk of the virus. The egg industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on improved biosecurity, including investing in truck washing stations, bussing in workers to reduce foot traffic, and lighting systems that discourage waterfowl from landing, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-egg-farmers-biosecurity-backyard-flocks-pandemic-risk/#:~:text=Metz%20said%20the,waterfowl%20from%20landing.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said Emily Metz&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of the American Egg Board. “All the measures we’re doing are still getting beat by this virus,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing and deploying a bird flu vaccine for poultry is one idea that some industry representatives have begun expressing cautious interest in. Last week, the USDA &lt;a href="https://news.zoetis.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Zoetis-Receives-Conditional-License-from-USDA-for-Avian-Influenza-Vaccine-H5N2-Subtype-Killed-Virus/default.aspx"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a conditional license to the pharmaceutical company Zoetis for an update to its vaccine for use in chickens that was initially developed in the early 2000s. The government has &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/01/08/us-department-agriculture-announces-15-additional-states-onboard-national-milk-testing-strategy-h5n1#:~:text=HPAI%20Vaccines%20for,capacity%20for%20vaccine."&gt;maintained a stockpile&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines for use in chickens, but they are not fully updated for the strain of the current outbreak. In the final weeks of the Biden administration, the USDA &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/01/08/us-department-agriculture-announces-15-additional-states-onboard-national-milk-testing-strategy-h5n1"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was moving to update the stockpile but had not made a broader policy shift away from a culling to a vaccination response. But assuming the newer vaccines are effective, some virologists &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/bird-flu-vaccine/index.html#:~:text=Complications%20of%20vaccinations"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; vaccinations aren’t necessarily a silver bullet as they don’t prevent infection and would need to be deployed strategically as one piece of a broader eradication effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/bird-flu-expert-tapped-by-trump-administration-for-pandemic-response-unit"&gt;reportedly tapped&lt;/a&gt; Gerald Parker, a veterinarian and a former senior public health and biosecurity official, to lead the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness. Dr. Ashish Jha, the former White House COVID-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-head-pandemic-office-gerald-parker/#:~:text=%22I%27ve%20not%20been,on%20important%20issues.%22"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; Parker as “a very good choice” and “deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration’s early steps appear to have at least partially hampered the outbreak response. The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-health-communications-cdc-hhs-fda-1eeca64c1ccc324b31b779a86d3999a4"&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt; on communications from public health agencies, including the CDC and the USDA, left state health officials and researchers working on the virus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-bird-flu-response-disrupted-early-weeks-trump-administration-sources-say-2025-02-14/"&gt;confused&lt;/a&gt; and isolated as meetings were canceled and regular reports on the course of the outbreak withheld. The USDA also admitted Tuesday that it &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716"&gt;accidentally fired&lt;/a&gt; employees working on the virus response that they’re now trying to rehire, and a &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-administration-firings-bird-flu-response-00204542"&gt;quarter of the staff&lt;/a&gt; in the USDA’s National Animal Health Laboratory Network’s program office has been let go. The office manages data and coordination across the labs doing animal testing including those working on the bird flu—labs were &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-administration-firings-bird-flu-response-00204542#:~:text=The%20labs%20that%20make%20up%20the%20American%20Association%20of%20Veterinary%20Laboratory%20Diagnosticians%20were%20informed%20that%20testing%20and%20other%20responses%20to%20the%20H5N1%20outbreak%20would%20be%20slower%20after%20the%20layoff%2C%20said%20Keith%20Poulsen%2C%20director%20of%20the%20Wisconsin%20Veterinary%20Diagnostic%20Laboratory."&gt;notified Friday&lt;/a&gt; that H5N1 testing would be slower following the firings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no way to confidently predict whether the bird flu will become a serious threat to humans, more scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/health/bird-flu-h5n1.html"&gt;grown concerned&lt;/a&gt; with how long the outbreak has dragged on. “Some people might say, ‘Well, you know what, if we’re going to have an epidemic or a pandemic wouldn’t we have seen it by now?” Bogoch told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. “And the answer is, maybe, maybe not, but, the costs of being wrong are pretty catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-worth-your-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth Your Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a stunning &lt;a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-live-like-royalty-and-dont-know-it"&gt;portrait of human progress&lt;/a&gt;, Charles C. Mann compared the lives of average middle-class Americans today to those of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century elites. Take Thomas Jefferson, for example: “Jefferson lived in a world of horse-drawn carriages, blazing fireplaces, and yellow fever. But what most separates our day from his is not our automobiles, airplanes, and high-rise apartments — it is that today vast systems provide abundant food, water, energy, and health to most people. … In Jefferson’s time, not even the president of the United States had what we have,” Mann wrote in the &lt;em&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;. “Jefferson believed that an informed citizenry was necessary to democratic self-rule — a mandate that extends all the way out to understanding the systems that envelop us. It’s easy to see why he believed this: Voters who understand how we are entwined with these systems will support maintaining and expanding them for our children and grandchildren. … Water, food, energy, public health — these embody a gloriously egalitarian and democratic vision of our society. Americans may fight over red and blue, but everyone benefits in the same way from the electric grid. Water troubles and food contamination are afflictions for rich and poor alike. These systems are powerful reminders of our common purpose as a society — a source of inspiration when one seems badly needed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They’ve been prohibited from even putting this kind of information out. This is critical information for parents to know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K6WPFBABJVDOZKIWUPB543YR2A"&gt;“This is a serious brain complication of influenza infection for which there are many cases out there right now occurring, parents should know about this. So if they have children who have these signs and symptoms, get them into the hospital, or at least the emergency room, as soon as possible. That’s the kind of thing that is very, very hard for us ... where we know we can do things to make it better, and we’re not given that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GMULJLILDNEQDNTJP5FKPIOFVA"&gt;Osterholm listed the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QFF2Y3QPOFHNJP5VOCOCL7XBCI"&gt;“Your children have influenza-like symptoms to begin with,” he said. “That’s how it starts — the fever, the muscle aches, the chills. But then there’s a certain lethargy. Meaning [there is a] certain tiredness, a lack of consciousness, where it’s very hard to arouse the children. Those are the symptoms, and when they appear, you need to seek medical care immediately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OBV3BL2IBNHPFC3HLM45JMA3KE"&gt;Pediatric deaths, possibly linked to vaccine denying, “are climbing dramatically in this country with this flu season,” Osterholm said. “Parents need to understand those and [the Trump CDC is] not [publicizing] that right now. We’re not sharing that with them. And I think that’s a huge, huge mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="423NPSVHL5ATHBQ66TPEAFIIOQ"&gt;“We know anecdotally that there are situations around the country where we have 12 children hospitalized in Boston, 10 children hospitalized at Stanford and many other locations around the country, and the media is not covering it, and nor is CDC. And this is something we can do something about, if parents understand this is occurring now and get their children in early. This surely can be a major step in helping to reduce the risk of serious illness and deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TBIAWZUU4RFNTGAUKMQLAMPJ7Q"&gt;New York Times Health Policy reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg, also appearing in the segment, said she is concerned about “a bird flu outbreak that could be very, very serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GWYGL5HLKBCH5EZPAZKI5PCEEU"&gt;“We’ve just seen the first death in the United States, someone who had severe bird flu,” she said. “Right now, the CDC says the risk to the general population is low, but if that virus mutates and starts spreading person to person, we are going to see a situation that makes COVID look like a walk in the park.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:P5WGJKFTNFBVFE7ZBZXYKJSQJE" data-fusion-component="P5WGJKFTNFBVFE7ZBZXYKJSQJE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:P5WGJKFTNFBVFE7ZBZXYKJSQJE" data-fusion-component="P5WGJKFTNFBVFE7ZBZXYKJSQJE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LI63RZD2WRBEJBJ6WGW5KPZFKM"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our journalism needs your support.

The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. has said he wants to build an “off-ramp” from the country’s reliance on insecticides and herbicides to grow food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The chemicals pollute our bodies the same way that they pollute the soil,” Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUqUcbs7yb8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. This week, Mr. Kennedy, now the federal health secretary, said that a commission established by President Trump to examine chronic disease rates would look into the use of pesticides, as well as childhood vaccines, microplastics and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy’s opposition to herbicides, particularly a widely used chemical called glyphosate, has earned support from some environmental advocates, so-called “MAHA moms” and wellness influencers. But some of the claims he and others have made about glyphosate — including that it is potentially linked to cancer, gluten allergies and a variety of other health issues — are based on science that is still not settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Prominent organizations have come to markedly different judgments on glyphosate after reviewing the research. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;classified glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Two years later, the Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-releases-draft-risk-assessments-glyphosate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;concluded that glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” and that it posed “no other meaningful risks to human health when the product is used according to the pesticide label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So should you be trying to avoid it? Here’s what the science shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-143dbf2f"&gt;How is glyphosate used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Glyphosate, first sold by Monsanto in 1974 under the brand name Roundup, kills weeds by inhibiting an enzyme that is essential for plant growth. It became the most used weedkiller nationwide after Monsanto introduced genetically modified crops that were resistant to glyphosate’s effects, said Marty Williams, an ecologist with the United States Department of Agriculture’s research service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/toxic-herbicides-map-showing-high-use-state-rcna50052#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Nearly half&lt;/a&gt; of all planted acres of corn and soybeans in the United States are treated with glyphosate-based herbicides, as are some crops like tree nuts and grapes.

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a TikTok trend, everyone. Naturally, though, TikTok has picked it up and sent the #saltwater trend skyrocketing. People have been adding salt to their water for decades, and there are reported benefits, like boosting hydration and restoring lost minerals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I exercise roughly five times a week, enjoying activities like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/what-to-wear-for-hot-yoga" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/what-to-wear-for-hot-yoga"&gt;hot yoga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/9-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-crossfit-beginner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/9-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-crossfit-beginner"&gt;CrossFit&lt;/a&gt;, which means I sweat — a lot. Sweating can cause dehydration if those lost electrolytes aren’t replenished, and I’ve heard that adding a pinch of salt to your tap water could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious, I did some digging into the existing research. I also spoke with two registered nutritionists to see if there’s anything to the salt water trend and what the potential health benefits include. Here’s what has happened so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-salt-water-trend"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the salt water trend?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it involves adding a pinch of salt to your water to promote water absorption and prevent dehydration, similar to how electrolyte tablets or drinks work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adding salt to water, a practice often referred to as “electrolyte water” is becoming increasingly popular,” says Elena Rolt, a registered nutritional therapist and certified functional medicine practitioner at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.healthmiro.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="http://www.healthmiro.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Health Miro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumn_bates_/video/7228734496248450347" data-video-id="7228734496248450347"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Salt helps with rehydration and maintaining electrolyte balance,” Rolt explains. “Salt contains two key electrolyte minerals — sodium and chloride — that aid in fluid retention by the cells rather than being rapidly excreted by the body. This can be especially beneficial after sweating, whether from exercise, sauna, or illness, as it helps replenish lost electrolytes and prevent dehydration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rolt, sodium and chloride are the most abundant electrolytes in the body, helping to maintain fluid balance, regulate blood pressure and aid in nerve signaling. Drinking water with a pinch of salt could even reduce muscle cramps, especially after intense physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chloride found in salt may stimulate the production of hydrochloric acid, promoting better digestion and nutrient absorption,” Rolt adds. “Some people also report an energy boost from electrolyte water, as the sodium helps regulate blood pressure, nerve and muscle function, reducing fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love boosting energy and hydration levels with an electrolyte tablet or drink, especially before a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-hyrox-beginner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-hyrox-beginner"&gt;Hyrox competition&lt;/a&gt; or intense CrossFit class. After hot yoga, I can be immediately found guzzling cold water as I recover from the heat. I also see many runners, especially long-distance ones, topping up with isotonic gels and drinks. Could I save a whole lot of money by adding a pinch of salt to my water instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened and what I learned when I tried it for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-the-type-of-salt-you-use-matters-as-well-as-how-much-and-how-often-you-use-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. The type of salt you use matters, as well as how much and how often you use it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grabbed one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-water-bottles" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-water-bottles"&gt;best water bottles&lt;/a&gt;, opened my laptop, and got to work learning what salt I should use, how much and how often. After all, I’ve had it drummed into me that I should&lt;em&gt; limit&lt;/em&gt; the amount of salt I put into my body. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7384997" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7384997" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; consistently shows excessive sodium consumption is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolt tells me: “When it comes to how much salt to add, it is best to start with a small amount…a small pinch of salt or around ¼ of a teaspoon per one liter of water.” That’s really to assess how your body reacts; then, you can adjust to suit your preference. Interestingly, Rolt says you shouldn’t be able to taste it. If you can, you’re probably using too much. Noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the type of salt, Rolt advises unrefined sea salt like Maldon salt or Himalayan pink salt, as these contain a “wider range” of electrolytes like magnesium, calcium and potassium, plus trace minerals like manganese, selenium, zinc and copper. Refined table salt only contains sodium and chloride, lacking other minerals lost during the refining process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for how often, Rolt says adding unrefined salt to your water should be done “strategically,” such as after intense physical activity, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-boosted-my-exercise-recovery-with-heat-and-cold-therapy-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-boosted-my-exercise-recovery-with-heat-and-cold-therapy-heres-what-happened"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, time spent in hot climates, or periods of illness. While she doesn’t mention alcohol intake, it could also help replenish lost fluids during a nasty hangover (I’ve&lt;em&gt; definitely&lt;/em&gt; turned to an electrolyte drink with a sore head on more than one occasion!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-i-peed-less-yes-really"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. I peed less (yes, really)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drink a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of water and find myself peeing often. I’ve been told by my doctor (on several occasions) that I might not be absorbing fluids properly, given that I’m also thirsty even after a drink. Plus, I’m neither diabetic nor pre-diabetic — and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-symptoms/art-20044248" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-symptoms/art-20044248" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;increased thirst can be a symptom&lt;/a&gt; of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of monitoring my trips to the toilet and how I felt each day, I noticed I needed to pee less often, which surprised me. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting to feel any different. Could I really be retaining water better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jennie Norton, registered dietician nutritionist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://veganwins.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://veganwins.co.uk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Vegan Wins&lt;/a&gt;, says adding salt to water every day isn’t always necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people get plenty of sodium from food, and drinking salted water when you don’t need it won’t do you any favors,” she warns. “Too much sodium over time is linked to high blood pressure and heart issues, and in the short term, it can cause bloating and fluid retention. If you overdo it, it can even make dehydration worse by pulling water out of your cells instead of helping you retain it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Norton recommends adding a little salt to water if you’re losing electrolytes in specific situations, like recovering from a stomach bug or periods of dehydration, but not every day. “It might be better to focus on water-rich foods or plain filtered water for hydration,” she adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given this is just an experiment, I’ll probably limit adding salt to water to exercise-heavy days or when I’m feeling a little dehydrated. Or hungover, let's face it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolt says adding unrefined salt to your water should be done “strategically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-i-learned-more-about-the-risks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. I learned more about the risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a qualified coach, I know that excessive salt intake isn’t good for your diet or health (no more than 6g per day), but I wanted to know if adding a pinch of salt to my water regularly (given I already felt it had been helping me retain water) could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your diet already contains a lot of salt…adding more to your water is not advisable,” Norton tells me. “Individuals with high blood pressure, kidney issues, or heart disease should consult a healthcare professional before incorporating any salt.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve learned the general consensus is that drinking enough water — the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/keeping-hydrated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/keeping-hydrated" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;daily recommended intake&lt;/a&gt; is roughly 2-2.5 liters or 8 glasses — should be enough to keep you functioning. Plus, eating a diet rich in whole foods, fruits, veggies and whole grains that contain potassium and magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve been sweating a lot or recovering from an illness, something like coconut water or a simple homemade electrolyte drink with a little citrus and a tiny pinch of salt can help replenish what you’ve lost,” adds Norton. If you struggle to retain fluids, checking with a medical professional for a wider health concern could also be useful to rule out any underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-is-it-good-to-add-salt-to-your-water"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it good to add salt to your water?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty on top of my diet. I cook from scratch on most days, eat plenty of fruit and veggies and ensure my water bottle is regularly topped up and by my side. Given that I’m not diabetic but still struggle to retain fluids, I’ll be adding a pinch of salt to my water here and there, and I believe it's helping me feel more hydrated and less thirsty day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I plan to prioritize a pinch of salt on days when I know I’ll be hitting the gym hard rather than making it a daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this experiment, I found it interesting that you can provide the body with necessary minerals (electrolytes like sodium, magnesium and potassium) to retain and absorb the water you drink throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without them, you might drink enough fluids but without retaining the nutrients you need. That doesn't mean you need to add salt to your water every day, but a little could help if you don't sit in a higher-risk health category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for other ways to boost hydration?

In an article for Alzheimer's Research UK, Dr. Rittman conveyed the complexity of diagnosing dementia in its nascent phases and how it can easily be mistaken for other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged the common uncertainty faced when changes are noticed in someone you know, "And that means it can be hard to know how much to worry if you think someone might be a bit different than when you last saw them. That's understandable – it's something many of us know very little about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a YouGov survey revealed a gap in public awareness, with less than half of those surveyed (49%) capable of identifying "memory loss" as a consequence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mere 12% of the 2,162 respondents were aware that the disease leads to a loss of independence, while a significant portion (22%) confessed to having no clue about the repercussions of living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a surprising finding, given how dementia will impact so many of us", Dr Rittman expressed. "It is important, then, to raise awareness of early signs of dementia so people with symptoms can be referred to a memory clinic for a full assessment and an accurate, timely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An early diagnosis means that people with dementia and their loved ones can plan for the future, access the right care and support, and consider the option of taking part in research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman then highlighted some of the key symptoms to be aware of. He stated, "When it first starts, dementia's signs and symptoms are often mild and not that easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mild forgetfulness, changes to perception or the way we speak can be early indications that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/163145/donald-trumps-words-super-bowl"&gt;Donald Trump's telling words at the Super Bowl exposed by lip reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen"&gt;Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/161023/five-early-signs-dementia-including-one-shows-bed-night" target="_blank"&gt;Five early signs of dementia - including one that shows in bed at night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important to know that these kinds of symptoms can have other causes, such as low mood, or the side-effects of medications. But they could be early signs of dementia," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rittman, issues with memory and thinking are symptoms of dementia that might become noticeable when someone is watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He elaborated, "Early on, forgetfulness could be mild, affecting memory for places or things that have happened in the past. You may notice someone asking the same question in quick succession or struggling to remember the names of objects around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People may find they struggle to concentrate on daily tasks, or they may find following the storyline of a TV program difficult for example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 08:23:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5iYUlvWmtJckRSNmZJdnFYUWx2S1U3RGxjeXFYb19sVHRMU1lCN2Fldl9zRmVHcXRZZWxpbm9rTDFVLWFNQVk1XzJyLXZfNHZsQXRUTjRXWDQzcFdYOVlzTl91YllsN00tZmUwNXgzbFNkT3BtVEF1RVcxOHRrMFVvN0V2RVRvYVp3NFhIZGNMZ2pDdTlNdUJGMnMxbXlUMEdXZDk3SGc</guid></item><item><title>Want To Prevent Dementia?

That report found that 45% of cases of cognitive decline or dementia could be delayed or even prevented by simple lifestyle interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that the Neurology journal is keeping up with the current trend in health care, which is to try and emphasize wellness and prevention and not just response to disease,” Ellison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/tanu-garg/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Tanu Garg" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/tanu-garg/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Tanu Garg&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular neurologist at Houston Methodist Hospital who often treats stroke patients, added that many of her patients’ families ask what can they do so they don’t end up in the same situation as their loved ones — and these lifestyle interventions are the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why these questions are very important, because we are trying to prevent people from having difficulties in the future, whether it’s heart attack, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/stroke" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="strokes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/stroke" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt; or just, in general, for brain health,” Garg explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do these factors impact brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s clear how certain habits mentioned above could affect your cognitive health (like wearing a helmet, for example), other factors are a little more nuanced ― but are just as important to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, socialization is a true indicator of brain health. “We are social beings ... and there are even changes in metabolic activity and brain activity that occur when we’re isolated that are harmful,” Ellison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With isolation comes loneliness, which can put you at higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, Ellison added. “It’s very important to cultivate a social network,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg also noted that those with close family and friend connections can also get more support when recovering from health issues, which is important for well-being, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The factors that seem to relate more to heart health, like blood pressure, are important, too. “Almost everything that’s good for the brain is actually also good for the heart,” Ellison said. “When the heart is functioning properly, it provides nutrients and oxygen, which fuel the brain and keep it healthy, and it helps remove toxic metabolites from the brain as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the heart is not functioning properly, the circulation and oxygenation and metabolic care of the brain is compromised, and that can lead to cognitive changes,” Ellison continued. He added that one of the most common kinds of cognitive decline in older people is “vascular cognitive impairment, which is a direct result of compromised circulation in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said simple, small positive habits, like diet and exercise, can often bring the biggest health rewards. She recommends a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mediterranean diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and said you should talk to your doctor about the best exercise regimen for you, as it varies person to person. Additionally, if you smoke, you should talk to your doctor about quitting, to protect both your brain and your overall health, Garg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to manage your emotions, and you can talk to your doctor about how to best do that, too. “There are so many different ways to curb anxiety and stress, but people don’t realize how much of an impact it can make on your body and your brain,” Garg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that anxiety is linked to higher rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Exercise benefits your brain health and your heart health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are questions you should bring up throughout your life, not just once you reach a certain age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s never too late to think more holistically about your brain health, you should always pay attention to them — not just once you reach old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison said these questions focus “on prevention throughout the life cycle, not just in the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cognitive decline is often only associated with getting older, problems during mid-life, such as sleep disorders and unmanaged high blood pressure, can compound your risks for cognitive decline and dementia later on, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to talk to your doctor about any cognitive changes you notice, no matter your age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go see a doctor sooner than later, then we can find things that are reversible to prevent further decline. But when you’re afraid or you’re not sure if it’s the right thing to do, then we may get to the point where you’re not able to fix things,” Garg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg always reminds her patients that it’s OK to ask your doctor questions, whether you think they’re the “right” ones or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison added that not all cognitive changes are related to major health issues, either. Stress, anxiety, certain medications and certain health conditions can cause cognitive issues, too, making it crucial to talk to your primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor can also help you incorporate exercise, social connections, a nutritious diet and other healthy lifestyle habits into your life — because there’s real proof that these good habits work, Ellison said. &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/dementia-rates-falling-13-decade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The rate of dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/dementia-rates-falling-13-decade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;The rate of dementia&lt;/a&gt; in older adults is decreasing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 44-year-old man in France&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;For two weeks prior to going to the doctor, the man had been feeling mild weakness in his left leg. There weren't any notable abnormalities in his medical history or neurological development, except for when a shunt had to be placed in his head when he was 6 months old. The shunt helped relieve fluid buildup in his brain, which had an unknown cause. When he turned 14 years old, the shunt was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; When the man reported his leg weakness to medical practitioners, doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head. They also performed neuropsychological testing, which revealed that the man's IQ was 75, below the average score of 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors determined that the patient was living with a brain that was at least half the average size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain scans also revealed a large buildup of fluid in his brain, which allowed little room for tissue. This left the patient with just a thin sheet of brain tissue pushed up against his skull. The scans showed that the fluid-filled cavities in the brain — called ventricles — were extremely dilated. It's likely that this fluid accumulation drove the man's leg weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; Doctors drained this excess fluid from the man's skull, which helped the patient regain some of his leg strength. In a case report published in&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61127-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61127-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the doctors wrote that a new shunt was also inserted inside the man's skull, and within a few weeks, the patient's neurological examinations — which were used to evaluate his leg weakness — returned to baseline. "The findings on neuropsychological testing and CT did not change," they noted, so the man's IQ remained about the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Over the course of evolutionary history, humans' brains became notably large compared with those of our relatives, leading to improved cognitive capacity and language acquisition. The exact reasons for this growth are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/de-novo-genes-human-brain-size" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/de-novo-genes-human-brain-size"&gt;&lt;u&gt;not fully understood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but are likely linked to a combination of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://karger.com/bbe/article/98/2/93/835670" target="_blank" data-url="https://karger.com/bbe/article/98/2/93/835670" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;environmental&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/human-brain-evolution-prey-size.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/human-brain-evolution-prey-size.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dietary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; factors, among other pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-JQg4ADxanxwnGUwgDCk9M6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-JQg4ADxanxwnGUwgDCk9M6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A human's brain also grows significantly within a person's lifetime, with the brain during adulthood typically being &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/scientists-debunk-myth-that-human-brains-are-underdeveloped-at-birth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/scientists-debunk-myth-that-human-brains-are-underdeveloped-at-birth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dramatically larger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than the size of their brain as a newborn. In the man's case, it might have been expected that he would show deficits due to having a smaller-than-average brain. However, despite the smaller size of his brain, the man did not show any deficits and was working as a civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had he not developed leg weakness, his small brain may well have gone unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-JQg4ADxanxwnGUwgDCk9M6-bXSULOMmeUkebvBBV2bvg37KhB2Pp6YE" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-JQg4ADxanxwnGUwgDCk9M6-bXSULOMmeUkebvBBV2bvg37KhB2Pp6YE slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;A little cat named Sekhmet is living up to her name. She survived the avian flu and is now back home with her human, Kiki Knopp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's a fighter. I named her Sekhmet originally because Sekhmet is the goddess of war and healing, and she has been that,” said Knopp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knopp &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/two-multnomah-county-cats-euthanized-after-being-infected-with-bird-flu#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/two-multnomah-county-cats-euthanized-after-being-infected-with-bird-flu#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;lost two kitties last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. She says, so far, only one had a confirmed case of the avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've been struggling to sleep because our two girls we lost were bed-cuddlers,” said Knopp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Knopp found out that not two, not three, but seven of her cats caught the avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just found that out and honestly at this point, I'm almost a little numb, because the first three last week we knew the chances of the rest having caught it from the same food,” said Knopp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That food is the free-range chicken formula by Wild Coast pet foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is asking cat owners to heed caution when it comes to two batches of their food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A veterinarian at Dove Lewis tells us every cat is different, and the severity of the disease will depend on the cat. But nonetheless, here are some tips on how you can keep your kitties safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Number one, they can feed pet food that is not raw. Raw poultry diets are shown to now be a contributing factor in developing disease. We can keep our cats inside and limit access to wild birds and wild bird feces,” said Kelly Flaminio, a veterinarian at Dove Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:50:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOYk93b1NTSG9MbkVDTE5TeWhGOUdTajdNejJTbWVnSmUzcVdvYllGb243MTJNcnlYQ1BRdklrX1RkWFp1NHZzVndZeEEzSkNBcFhBVV9Qc0ZGNkswRmNQR0REU0tFbjVocEJBcmQ4LXpwZTZhb3E0M1FQNzA3MVZpbk4zQ0JYSmF0eEp3ZjEyb0NIX0swOUkwZHJ3NEF6ckZpdHhkM3pfOEozY0k</guid></item><item><title>Heart disease: Natural supplement may help the heart break down fat - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOeXYzWUw1RGRXU2NZZW1PcktLR3hRTGtOZ09EdVlkZFBTZGZzMS1mM3YtMk9uM1RqMVIweGVNOEFEdjU5ejliWHIweVJnMEFWRVRVZlhTeDhpUWpNSk1OSWNLejFoRXUzT1hGcHVsSERlV2E1NVB5MV9CZU1kZnJUWGozMlo5M0YwOEdXWlBKS19Ba0FmRDg5OTFGTUVQaHJxVUNVWlRZRzRwV2JOVEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/supplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/supplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/supplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/supplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="Pieces of coconut stacked on top of each other" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="css-90fpmc icon-hl-pinterest css-by55vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fnatural-supplement-tricaprin-may-help-people-new-type-heart-disease&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F02%2Fsupplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Heart%20disease%3A%20Natural%20supplement%20may%20help%20the%20heart%20break%20down%20fat" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/supplement-heart-Stocksy_txp020705eecF5400_Medium_180947-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Scientists have investigated the use of the tricaprin supplement in patients with heart conditions.

In this condition, there is a problem with the breakdown of triglycerides by cells in the heart. The condition ultimately leads to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00611-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; examined individuals with triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy who received the supplement tricaprin. Tricaprin is a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), found in coconut oil and dairy products, and is used in food, cosmetics, and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intervention group displayed notable cardiac benefits compared to participants who did not receive tricaprin. This included improvement in fat breakdown, durable heart failure recovery, and improvements in the left ventricle. Overall survival rates were also higher among the group that received tricaprin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TDCV) is a fairly recently discovered heart condition. As noted in the current research, the condition has to do with a problem with the intracellular breakdown of long-chain triglycerides. Thus, there is a buildup of lipids and energy failure in the heart’s muscle cells and in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Some cases of TDCV have a genetic cause, while the cause is unknown in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, who was not involved in the study, explained the following to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) is a rare cardiovascular disorder in which the body’s heart and blood vessel cells are not able to properly process triglycerides as an energy source. This then causes heart muscle and coronary artery dysfunction, resulting in severe heart failure and coronary artery disease. The condition is not entirely understood, and effective treatment options have been lacking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of the current study wanted to understand how tricaprin, which is “a class of medium-chain” triglycerides, affected TDCV outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research regarding tricaprin in this area had exhibited positive results, so this study wanted to look at overall survival rates in participants from registry studies who received tricaprin relative to the controls who did not receive tricaprin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study compared twenty-two participants who received tricaprin to 190 who did not. All participants had confirmed TDCV and had received their diagnosis at or after age twenty. Participants receiving tricaprin had to meet several inclusion criteria, including experiencing cardiac symptoms that were resistant to standard remedies. There were also several exclusion criteria for receiving tricaprin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who received tricaprin, the average age that participants received their diagnoses was around 58 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent tests to evaluate myocardial lipolysis or the breakdown of fat by the heart muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals who received tricaprin experienced several benefits. For participants who received tricaprin, the tests that reflected fat breakdown suggested that cells in the heart were able to more effectively break down fat after receiving tricaprin compared to participants’ baselines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed clinical benefits for the group, such as improvement of heart failure symptoms and durable heart failure recovery. Researchers also observed improvements in the left ventricle, including better ejection fraction and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9288763/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reverse remodeling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of overall survival rates, the tricaprin group had 100% three-year and five-year survival rates. In contrast, the control group had a 78.6% three-year survival rate and a 68.1% five-year survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking only at participants who also had heart failure, which included 14 intervention participants and 128 controls, the tricaprin group again experienced a 100% three-year and five-year survival rate, while the control group’s three-year survival rate was 76.8%, and the five-year survival rate was 64.8%. This analysis excluded participants with &lt;hl-trusted-source source="American Heart Associaiton" rationale="Highly respected national organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/what-is-heart-failure/classes-of-heart-failure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;NYHA 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, or heart failure stage four because no participants who received tricaprin had this level of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rochesterregional.org/providers/scott-c-feitell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Scott C. Feitell&lt;/a&gt;, DO, FACC, FHFSA, director of Heart Failure and director of the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Rochester Regional, who was not involved in the study, offered the following comments on the study’s findings to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a very well-designed trial with an excellent analysis done for a small patient population with a rare disease. Based on prior research, the team in this trial extended their proposed treatment model to a larger patient population, compared it to an untreated control arm, and followed patients for a longer period of time. They were able to not only demonstrate marked improvement in ejection fraction by echocardiography once patients received treatment, but they also used a novel radiotracer (I-123 BMIPP) to demonstrate enhanced lipid metabolism in patients on treatment. Most importantly patients felt better and had improved functional class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study did have some limitations, some of which future research may be able to address. For example, this study focused on the Japanese population. Studying the effects in other groups will likely be helpful as research expands in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the authors note that it is unclear how newly developed drugs to treat heart failure will affect people who have TGCV and heart failure. Only a small number of participants received these noted medications. Future research may also be able to focus on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data on the left ventricular ejection fraction of one participant with heart failure following tricaprin intervention are unavailable. This measurement is important as it is used to assess the heart’s pumping efficiency in sending oxygen-rich blood to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the timing of TGCV diagnosis to participants starting tricaprin varied, which could have introduced bias risk in the research regarding overall survival. However, researchers used a specific method in their sensitivity analysis to try to account for this. While researchers were able to account for some factors in their analysis, it’s possible that some relevant components were missed. Additionally, this study did not involve blinding of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants received tricaprin with support from the TGCV/Neutral Lipid Storage Disease (NLSD) Patient Association and had to be requesting assistance from this association. This and other exclusion and inclusion criteria could have affected the sample and who was able to participate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tochino Foundation collaborated with Osaka University to provide the Patient Association with tricaprin for free. The Patient Association also communicated periodically with participants. Additionally, the authors noted several conflicts of interests. All these factors could have affected the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of participants who received tricaprin was also fairly small, so larger sample sizes with more female participants may also be relevant to future work. Additionally, only three women included in the intervention group had heart failure, and this could have impacted these results. One participant who received tricaprin died 5.3 years after starting tricaprin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While TGCV is still rare, the authors note that the results may carry over to other individuals. They note that triglycerides are major components of lipid droplets, and lipid droplets are often in people who have heart failure. If future research confirms the findings, tricaprin could benefit people with heart failure in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologist &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Randy Gould&lt;/a&gt;, DO, FACC with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC, who was not involved in the study, noted the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ticaprin resulted in regression of the triglyceride buildup in the blood vessels of the heart, improved clinical effects on cardiac function and greater survival results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential clinical effects of this data is to design future studies to determine if ticarpin has similar cardiovascular effects (TG [triglyceride] regression) in patients with elevated triglyceride levels, but do not have TGCV. If the results show improvement as well, then ticarpin may be an additional treatment option for patients with elevated triglycerides,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:39:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOeXYzWUw1RGRXU2NZZW1PcktLR3hRTGtOZ09EdVlkZFBTZGZzMS1mM3YtMk9uM1RqMVIweGVNOEFEdjU5ejliWHIweVJnMEFWRVRVZlhTeDhpUWpNSk1OSWNLejFoRXUzT1hGcHVsSERlV2E1NVB5MV9CZU1kZnJUWGozMlo5M0YwOEdXWlBKS19Ba0FmRDg5OTFGTUVQaHJxVUNVWlRZRzRwV2JOVEE</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu latest updates: Wyoming confirms state's 1st human case of bird flu, bringing total to 70 across 13 states - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxPRHVfUlVRWXhXMjZHQmNzdU5Dek9Vai16N2p4RnRiTkt2NWhRbHZ3eFI0ZTlPRURmRzg1NGpNTmJnY1B0c1ZiT1VTWEpFSHExNEZPNVB6TVRvdXBjLVpheVBJdE5HTXRTMGNHNENxVDdqcUhlNFBBaW4xNmdTODA3YzlyOW5iMDh4SEZGOHdXdnlTYk1iQlVabjN5SEZuLVJjcnNPcWZ1cmI1ZzJWcDJGV3p0aVczOFZVbHRoMlNmdURwZVFnZm5WbzVERmsxWUYxb3JxTnJMYjZuNWk0OG1SWldpbi1tVExKY2pNN0xRdTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-body"&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bird flu is spreading across the United States, causing egg shortages and soaring prices at supermarkets and restaurants — however, the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says &lt;/a&gt;that the current public health risk is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wyoming Department of Health;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Wyoming Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the state's first human case of H5N1 bird flu.

			&lt;p&gt;Every year around 374 million children and adults need access to medical oxygen to survive. This need is rising, but less than one in three people can obtain this life-saving treatment in non-wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00496-0"&gt;In a new report&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 researchers have laid out a plan to tackle this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I carry the oxygen like a backpack, so I can go to school and get together with my friends, even exercise," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00496-0"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; a child living with chronic lung disease in Chile, quoted in the report. "[With oxygen] I can live a normal life with my illness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"&gt;Oxygen therapy&lt;/a&gt; is critical for people with emergency conditions and life-sustaining for those under anesthesia and people with chronic respiratory failure. We have been using it to save lives for at least 150 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting it to all the people who need it has remained a global challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152426" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MapNumberOfPeopleWithMedicalOxygenNeedsAndAmountOfOxygenNeeded-e1739846959253.jpg" alt="Map showing how many patients need oxygen around the world" class="wp-image-152426 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152426" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Number of people with medical oxygen needs and minimum amount of oxygen required to meet it in 2021.

&lt;p&gt;"Previous efforts… largely focused on the delivery of equipment to produce more oxygen, neglecting the supporting systems and people required to ensure it was distributed, maintained, and used safely and effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="152425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="152425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; exposed many of these flaws, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2021-covid-19-oxygen-emergency-impacting-more-than-half-a-million-people-in-low--and-middle-income-countries-every-day-as-demand-surges"&gt;leading to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-05/indonesia-oxygen-shortage-covid-19-coronavirus-yogyakarta/100267258"&gt;the deaths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.ghspjournal.org/content/12/4/e2300515"&gt;many loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't want any future generations of doctors having to decide like God who lives and who dies, because that is what we had to do when there wasn't enough oxygen," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00496-0"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a physician in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extensive analysis, the researchers laid out a plan for oxygen production, storage, and distribution systems that can be implemented in even the least wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They propose 52 recommendations for governments, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00556-4"&gt;the oxygen industry&lt;/a&gt;, global health advocates, academics and health professionals to work towards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152427" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem.jpg" alt="Diagram showing schematic for national medical oxygen system" class="wp-image-152427 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem.jpg 1140w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem-642x249.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/KeyFeaturesOfAResiliantNationalMedicalOxygenSystem-600x233.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152427" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Grahem et al., &lt;em&gt;Lancet Glob Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as increasing resources and improving cooperation between government and industry, the researchers identified that access to properly working &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"&gt;pulse oximeters&lt;/a&gt; – a small device that measures oxygen levels in the blood – plays a huge role in ensuring medical oxygen gets where it is most needed on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02452-8"&gt;studies reveal&lt;/a&gt; many pulse oximetry devices do not take accurate readings in people with darker skin colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need to make high-quality, pulse oximeters more affordable and widely accessible," &lt;a href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/news-stories/global-action-needed-solve-medical-oxygen-crisis"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Graham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently in low- and middle-income countries, pulse oximeters are only available in 54 percent of general hospitals and 83 percent of tertiary hospitals. Even then, shortages and breakdowns are common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Right now, most of our hospitals are cemeteries for broken medical equipment," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00496-0"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; a physician in Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exacerbated by a shortage of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00510-2"&gt;biomedical engineers&lt;/a&gt; – essential workers responsible for ensuring all the life saving equipment is working when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The number of available biomedical engineers was not adequate to handle the oxygen needs and maintenance of the electrical equipment," a physician in Ethiopia &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(24)00496-0"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was sweating. I felt like there was no life in my hands or feet. I felt much better when I got on oxygen and my symptoms got better and I thought I would come out of it.

It may even put you at risk for cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, led by UC San Francisco researchers, found that older, healthy volunteers, with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, showed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency. These levels were associated with more damage to the brain's white matter -- the nerve fibers that enable communication between areas of the brain -- and test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt; on Feb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers led by senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, said that the results raise questions about current B12 requirements and suggest the recommendations need updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms," said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. "Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower B12 correlates with slower processing speeds, brain lesions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize. In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants' white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could "impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize." Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits," she said. "Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

As part of the U.S. settlement, the company agreed to remove the words “made from real ginger” from its marketing in the future. However, &lt;a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-dry-will-still-tell-canadians-it-is-made-from-real-ginger-just-not-americans#:~:text=Canada%20Dry%20Ginger%20Ale%20will,action%20lawsuits%20over%20false%20advertising." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7820841" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the product is still marketed this way in Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger ale could actually do more harm than good. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/lukasz-kwapisz-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7820841" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Lukasz Kwapisz&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7820841" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Gastro Health&lt;/a&gt; in Miami, explained that the high sugar content in ginger ale and other sodas — usually upward of 30 grams per serving — can actually make stomach troubles worse.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too much sugar could trigger inflammation and may increase bloating and gas, which could further irritate an upset stomach,” he told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about diet ginger ale? Sassos doesn’t recommend it for an upset stomach, because the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-to-know-about-sugar-alcohols/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7820841" data-affiliate="true"&gt;sugar alcohols&lt;/a&gt; used to sweeten some of these products “may only further exacerbate symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, the carbonation in ginger ale and other fizzy beverages may help ease their gastrointestinal distress, Sassos said, while other people may find that it makes things worse. So it really depends on how your body responds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian Maya Feller of &lt;a href="http://mayafellernutrition.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7820841" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Maya Feller Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bigbuffguy246/are-you-a-buffalonian"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out that even though it has the word “ginger” in its name, ginger ale is not a “health food beverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re looking for a therapeutic property from it, it might most likely be placebo,” Feller&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;said. “And that’s fine, because you’re feeling better, right? At the end of the day, it is soda. And so I would encourage folks to interact with this the way that they would interact with soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to try instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

At the end of the day, it is soda. And so I would encourage folks to interact with this the way that they would interact with soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to try instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person slicing ginger on a wooden cutting board with a knife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you’re looking to ease stomach discomfort, consider skipping the soda aisle in favor of the produce section, where you can pick up some fresh ginger, Kwapisz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Minced, ground, peeled or sliced in hot water, or even in capsules — 250 to 500 mg of powdered ginger,” he told HuffPost. “Any of these would give the greatest benefit to settling an upset stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sassos, too, recommends trying fresh ginger. Add a peeled knob or a few slices to a mug with boiling water and let it steep for five to 10 minutes, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Feller recommends ginger, fennel and chamomile teas if you’re in need of some relief. For some of her patients dealing with medication-induced nausea, she has found eating saltine crackers and other carbohydrates to be helpful.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;An outbreak of measles in West Texas has grown to 58 cases, including four patients who said they were vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Ten more cases were added to the Department of State Health Services' count Tuesday, including for the first time the four who self-reported they were vaccinated against the disease, according to the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-18-2025"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson with DSHS said health investigators are in the process of confirming whether the four were, in fact, vaccinated against measles and how many doses they may have received.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;DSHS &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas"&gt;initially warned&lt;/a&gt; of two cases of measles in underage children in Gaines County in late January. The disease has since spread to four other counties and 58 people — most of whom are children — but 45 of the cases are still in Gaines County. Lubbock County, which reported a single case, is the largest county in which a case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Thirteen patients have been hospitalized, according to DSHS, and spokesperson Lara Anton said officials are still unsure what the initial source of exposure was. The outbreak is Texas’ largest in more than 30 years, and comes at a time where vaccination rates among children &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/30/texas-measles-vaccinations-schools/"&gt;have dropped&lt;/a&gt;. Almost 97% of Texas kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles in 2019, compared to 94.3% in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Despite the increase in infections among those potentially vaccinated, a DSHS spokesperson said virologists do not currently see “any evidence” the measles virus present in the patients has mutated into a vaccine-resistant variant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly referred to as the MMR vaccine, is about 93% effective with one dose and 97% effective with two doses, according to the CDC. The first dose is usually administered to infants aged 12 to 15 months, while the second dose is given to kids between 4 and 6. Follow-up doses are not required if patients received them in their youth, and older eligible patients can be immunized at any period.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles’ symptoms include high fever, watery eyes, runny nose and rashes, which can be minor or full-body. Symptoms can become serious and even fatal, especially among children and those who are unvaccinated. One in five unvaccinated people who are infected are hospitalized, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Part of what makes measles so infectious is the virus’ ability to stay active long after a patient has left, as the virus can stay active for up to two hours in the air and on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Anton said the outbreak has especially affected the large Mennonite community in Gaines County. While the Mennonite Church does not forbid or disavow vaccinations, Anton said their communities tend to be undervaccinated, which drastically increases the likelihood of infection. Measles has a 90% infection rate among unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Alongside the decrease in vaccination numbers, Texas lawmakers have introduced &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/"&gt;over 20 bills&lt;/a&gt; into the Legislature aimed at loosening vaccine requirements across the state with the support of vaccine-hesitant or anti-vaccine groups.&lt;/p&gt;

About 58% of U.S. adults 20 and older, including 64% of women and 51% of men, reported consuming a dietary supplement in the past 30 days, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db399.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt;.

A 2022 study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liver Transplantation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that drug-induced acute liver failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. What’s more, herbal and dietary supplements account for roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27677775/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hepatology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hepatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This doesn’t mean you should immediately toss out your &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/protein-powder-dietary-supplement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein powder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/vitamin-d-toxicity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D capsules;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin D capsules&lt;/a&gt;. Dietary supplements can indeed help you meet your daily requirements of essential nutrients and improve or maintain your overall health, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; says. But they come with risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:researchers at the University of Michigan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;researchers at the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; estimated that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These supplements are taken for everything from allergies to menstrual cramps to weight loss. And that’s not all the team uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31168513/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:In a previous study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;In a previous study&lt;/a&gt;, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products,” senior author &lt;a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/23/robert-john-fontana-md?pk_vid=1efa7b55d6473b70173992014187ffb5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Robert Fontana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Robert Fontana&lt;/a&gt;, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/15-million-americans-take-supplements-may-be-toxic-liver" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an August news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an August news release&lt;/a&gt;. “We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it’s basically a coin flip if that’s true or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, numerous studies have found supplements to be contaminated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691524003727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:toxic heavy metals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;toxic heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dietary supplements aren’t FDA-approved&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the FDA regulates supplements, the agency doesn’t review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness as it does with &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/hims-hers-super-bowl-ad-compounded-glp-1-drugs-novo-nordisk-wegovy-semaglutide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug approvals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drug approvals&lt;/a&gt;. And though supplements are typically found in the pharmacy sections of both online and brick-and-mortar retailers, the FDA regulates them &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/dietary-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as food, not drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;as food, not drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s up to manufacturers to properly label their products, which the FDA reviews after they hit the market. The agency keeps &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/compliance-actions-and-activities/warning-letters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a searchable database of warning letters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a searchable database of warning letters&lt;/a&gt; it has sent to companies accused of problems &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/about-warning-and-close-out-letters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as false claims or poor manufacturing practices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;such as false claims or poor manufacturing practices&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA also encourages consumers to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements/how-report-problem-dietary-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report problems with dietary supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report problems with dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Tell your doctor which dietary supplements you take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You may not feel you need to tell your health care provider you’re taking something as mundane as vitamin C gummies, but there’s a reason the FDA encourages it. Some supplements may negatively interact with certain medications you’re taking, and your doctor can help determine which supplements safely suit your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Take dietary supplements as intended&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Don’t fall for “megadosing” trends that promise speedy or exaggerated results. While rare, it is possible to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/poison/multiple-vitamin-overdose" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatally overdose on dietary supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fatally overdose on dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Office of Dietary Supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Office of Dietary Supplements&lt;/a&gt;, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption.

The disease is more common among poultry, but can spread to other animals through direct contact with infected birds or by consuming infected raw meat or milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T4NXU2J54VC3FEUVR34TACM42Y"&gt;A spokesperson for the state agency did not confirm whether the three Clackamas County cats had consumed raw pet food prior to their infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LUUXPEP6SRAJBPU5KHEDQGPH5I"&gt;Bird flu can lead to severe and fatal symptoms. Typical signs of bird flu are fever, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite and eye or nasal discharge. Dogs can also contract the disease but are less susceptible, according to the state agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RCZBU24AGRHSJC6A36MGHMUFYA"&gt;DoveLewis veterinary hospital in Portland said Tuesday it had treated two cats that tested positive for bird flu.

He was diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer in 2020, at the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It had started spreading to nearby organs and he was offered the nationally-recommended treatment of hormone therapy and radiotherapy for his particular type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;He said the treatment was brutal but, now aged 70, his cancer is in remission and he  is enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Pattison, from Durham, said: "I was lucky that I live close to a specialist cancer centre in Newcastle where I could get the best treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was hard going through it all and coping with the side effects but I am so thankful I got the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I feel fit and well.

"With cancer, we often hear people talking about what the next breakthrough is but, the fact remains, using what we have better could make a huge difference. It would extend and save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prof Aggarwal said there were likely to be several reasons for the problems and variation, including some services unfairly assuming older patients could not cope with treatment, as well as problems with staffing and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;He said there was evidence of smaller hospitals not always referring patients on to specialist centres where they can get treatment but added that even some of the big centres were coming up short for some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;RCS president Tim Mitchell said echoed the concerns, saying: "The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"At worst, this may mean some patients are needlessly dying or in unnecessary pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;Staggering&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And cancer charities said tacking the failings was arguably more important than reducing waiting times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said the findings were "quite staggering", adding that tackling the variation should be the "number one priority" in the forthcoming national cancer strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Getting the best care to give you the greatest chance of survival should not come down to which hospital you attend or where you live in the country," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Byrne said patients should get the right care for their particular type of cancer, no matter where they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We are concerned that people from deprived, rural or ethnically diverse communities could be losing out in particular," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Amy Rylance, from Prostate Cancer UK, said patients were effectively being denied their "best chance of a cure", adding: "This needs to change now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;NHS England cancer director Prof Peter Johnson said: "We know that patients' experience of cancer treatment does vary too often – and we are working hard to address this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: "Patients should be able to access the cancer care they need regardless of where they live and we are committed to addressing health inequalities as we rebuild the NHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A new cancer strategy is expected to be published in the second half of the year, which Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said will revolutionise services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A Welsh government spokeswoman said it was working with the NHS to "plan, deliver, recover and improve cancer services".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;She said the audit highlighted areas where further work was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:07:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBJSHFxazZLUVI5VmtKbmVtejNzYXZOSGVrU0Jyak1VSjk1Z052akY4bWVocWIzUWtRN21faTRSVVduMENYVUE0UWxFNG9nQk5DUEItSHozYVV6QdIBX0FVX3lxTE43WHo5RUV3SDFjdDM5RXREZlJncFNRa1RHZ0cwZEVtNGZOdElyYjVRMUljXzBKczN4cnU4YTI3NTVNdTJYX2FtTklrOS1Lc0FYY1RLNTlGR25UNlh6OEZB</guid></item><item><title>‘Absolutely concerning’: More CWD-killed elk found at second Wyoming feedground - WyoFile</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNZ2wwOTRTNUhZcFZWZUpqOFF2ZU5UejA0WXQxckFYOER1WHVoMHJVZHQ3N3dkMHU3RzNlSUU4Rl8tOGQ1R3lUYk5VUXg5SjRnSDVqbGdxcEE2TmpieUZEaTlvXzQtZ3MweExDeW91cUNiYjJRYm91TVZXdlQ3ckszcndDUnlDUFo1cTNhQkR5X2ppaVBGX0V5c09mdzN3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease prions that bind with soil and grass are accumulating in Wyoming-run feedgrounds, contaminating sites that have provided refuge for slews of close-packed elk each winter for generations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We knew it was an eventuality, but it’s absolutely concerning,” said Justin Binfet, deputy chief of wildlife for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “With every positive [elk] that’s out there, they’re starting to contaminate those feedgrounds more and more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, Game and Fish reported &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-confirms-first-case-of-chronic-wasting-disease-inside-an-elk-feedground/"&gt;its unwelcome first case of the infectious disease inside&lt;/a&gt; an elk feedground — the Scab Creek unit southeast of Pinedale. Then late last week, the agency &lt;a href="https://wgfd.wyo.gov/news-events/cwd-found-new-wyoming-hunt-area-1"&gt;sent word of its second and third cases&lt;/a&gt;, both detected in cow elk carcasses at the Dell Creek Feedground in the Hoback River basin. As the nearly indestructible prions pile up, they have the potential to inflame CWD’s spread, collapsing western Wyoming’s six feedground-dependent elk herds in the process. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A&lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/fewer-elk-sicker-elk-thats-what-the-experts-expect-if-wyoming-keeps-on-feeding/"&gt; recent U.S. Geological Survey study&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, anticipates that very outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there’s a propensity to “crystal ball it,” Binfet said, nobody knows exactly what’s about to happen. Game and Fish has a good feel for CWD transmission dynamics and prevalence in elk herds in the eastern part of the state, where it’s existed since 1986 and where elk also &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/in-the-laramie-mountains-too-many-elk-and-no-easy-fixes/"&gt;gather in large numbers&lt;/a&gt;. There, where there’s no feeding, the disease hasn’t had a devastating effect on elk, unlike &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/a-wyoming-mule-deer-herd-is-so-riddled-with-cwd-it-could-nearly-vanish/"&gt;what’s happened in some Wyoming mule deer herds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1353-scaled.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Elk are strung out on the Dell Creek Feedground on a snowy morning in February 2025. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are many questions, Binfet said, about how the disease will behave and propagate in western Wyoming where elk are being fed and concentrated, year-in and year-out, on the same relatively small plots of land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having these 22 state-run feedgrounds and then the National Elk Refuge, that’s going to certainly put the transmission potential at an unprecedented [level],” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists and game managers have discussed the risks of what could come only in the hypothetical: CWD hadn’t yet reached the feedgrounds and their super-concentrated elk, which &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/historic-die-off-at-wyoming-elk-feedground-prompts-management-changes/"&gt;are generally more prone to infecting each other with an array of diseases&lt;/a&gt;. The first case within Northwest Wyoming’s feedground region was &lt;a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/cwd-and-concentrated-elk-the-experiment-begins/article_3d25ffce-6e4f-5a97-a054-8a8a94a0a467.html"&gt;logged in the Jackson Herd in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and the disease subsequently showed up in the Pinedale, &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/chronic-wasting-disease-advances-near-wyomings-elk-feedgrounds/"&gt;Piney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/an-emerging-chronic-challenge-for-jackson-hole-elk/"&gt;Fall Creek herds&lt;/a&gt;. The two infected animals found dead at the Dell Creek Feedground mark the malady’s first known occurrence in the Upper Green River Elk Herd, meaning that five of the six feedground-dependent elk herds now harbor the disease. Only the Afton Elk Herd is yet to have its first case of CWD discovered. Altogether, the region is home to a combined 20,000-plus elk.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;State biologists and wardens aren’t being caught entirely on their heels by the arrival of a disease that threatens to reshape western Wyoming’s elk herds. Last March, the &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/as-disease-threatens-feedground-elk-wyoming-mired-in-planning-and-consensus-seeking/"&gt;Wyoming Game and Fish Commission signed off on&lt;/a&gt; the state agency’s first-ever elk feedground management plan. That plan, however, does not authorize wildlife managers to adapt feeding as they see fit without consensus from ranchers, outfitters and the highest levels of state government. Feedground closures, in fact, &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/legislature-strips-game-and-fish-of-elk-feedground-closure-power/"&gt;even require gubernatorial support&lt;/a&gt; because of intervention from the Wyoming Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the feeding plan, elk herds will be reviewed two at a time for the next three years. &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/outfitters-open-to-elk-feedground-changes-as-jackson-pinedale-herd-reviews-begin/"&gt;First up in 2025 are the Pinedale and Jackson Herds&lt;/a&gt;, out of which will come herd-specific “feedground management action plans.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_7245-scaled.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Stacked and fenced hay stored to feed elk on the Dell Creek Feedground is pictured here in December 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review of feeding operations at the Dell Creek Feedground, where CWD recently killed two cows, could still be years away, but that doesn’t altogether negate any type of immediate management response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Especially now, we’re going to renew conversations with feeders to keep an extra-vigilant eye out,” Binfet said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick-looking elk, he said, can and will be killed and tested as a precaution. &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CDpoILxZ2oVYI_N2h_obh_9Yta5nrS_r/view"&gt;Wyoming’s elk feeding management plan&lt;/a&gt; calls for developing a “carcass removal and disposal” protocol at each feedground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carcasses of the two CWD-stricken cows from the Dell Creek Feedground were taken to the dump, Binfet said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are also exploring the possibility of getting some large dumpsters,” Binfet said. “But, depending on where these feedgrounds are [located], logistically it’s quite a challenge to get these elk out.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the National Elk Refuge, where the &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/study-predicts-huge-decline-of-jackson-hole-elk-especially-if-refuge-keeps-feeding/"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is also planning for CWD’s arrival&lt;/a&gt;, managers dispose of animals via &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/elk-refuge-gets-crematory-for-cwd-infected-animals/"&gt;a diesel-fueled incinerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dell Creek Feedground in recent winters has attracted an average of 571 elk, significantly more than the 400-animal quota, according to the state’s management plan. The 32.5-acre site is located on the Bridger-Teton National Forest and feeding operations occur there under a permit, but not without controversy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dell-Creek-FG-map-1.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An aerial view of the Dell Creek Feedground, located on the Bridger-Teton National Forest at the foot of the Gros Ventre Range. (Bridger-Teton National Forest)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, the Sierra Club, Western Watersheds Project, Wyoming Wildlife Advocates and Gallatin Wildlife Association &lt;a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/local/elk-feedgrounds-dealt-another-legal-blow/article_a48e7213-9987-556e-b7fd-c3437fc249d3.html"&gt;sued the U.S. Forest Service, and won&lt;/a&gt;, after challenging how the federal agency was authorizing elk feeding on the site near Bondurant. Operations have depended on &lt;a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/local/forest-to-keep-feeding-elk-at-dell-creek/article_1f094761-ffbd-5118-a51a-5eb7bfa67e2c.html"&gt;temporary single-year permits ever since&lt;/a&gt;, though the Forest Service has &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/future-of-bridger-teton-elk-feedgrounds-uncertain/"&gt;started preparing an environmental impact statement&lt;/a&gt; that could OK continued feeding for the next two decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft of that plan considered four scenarios: continuing to feed elk per the status quo, denying the permit immediately, allowing a three-year phase-out, and allowing feeding only on an emergency basis in severe winters. Additional options might be included in the final EIS, which the state is still awaiting, Binfet said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

However, new research indicates that taking a break from this constant online access can lead to noticeable improvements in mental health, overall happiness, and the ability to focus. A study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf017" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that when people blocked mobile internet on their smartphones for just two weeks, they experienced better mental well-being, felt happier, and showed improved attention spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation behind this research stems from growing concerns about the potential negative effects of smartphone use on our minds and emotions. Smartphones offer unparalleled convenience, putting a wealth of information, entertainment, and social connections at our fingertips at all times. While these devices offer many advantages, there is a rising tide of public worry that constant smartphone use might be harming our cognitive abilities and emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys reveal that a significant portion of smartphone users are concerned about using their devices too much. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393785/americans-close-wary-bond-smartphone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a 2022 poll showed&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 60% of American smartphone users, and an even higher 80% of those under 30, feel they over-rely on their phones. These widespread worries are echoed in popular commentary, with some observers suggesting smartphones are “hijacking our minds” and negatively impacting an entire generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting these concerns, previous studies that examined the relationship between smartphone use and well-being have found links between heavier smartphone use and poorer subjective well-being, increased mental health issues, and reduced attentional capabilities. However, much of this prior research has been correlational, meaning it can show that two things are related but not necessarily that one causes the other. To address this gap, researchers wanted to investigate whether limiting access to mobile internet on smartphones would directly cause improvements in these areas. They designed a study to specifically target the feature that makes smartphones so powerful – their ability to connect to the internet from almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aimed to provide solid, experimental evidence to answer a question relevant in our increasingly digital world: if we were not constantly connected to the internet via our phones, would our minds and emotional well-being benefit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smartphones have drastically changed our lives and behaviors over the past 15 years, but our basic human psychology remains the same,” explained study author Adrian Ward, associate professor of marketing at the University of Texas at Austin. “Our big question was, are we adapted to deal with constant connection to everything all the time? The data suggest that we are not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, the researchers conducted a month-long study involving 467 participants from the United States and Canada. Participants were recruited online through a platform called Prolific. To participate, individuals had to be iPhone users because the application used to block internet access was only compatible with iPhones. The average age of the participants was 32 years old, and 63% were women. The group represented a range of educational backgrounds and ethnic identities, and included students, individuals employed full-time and part-time, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study employed a randomized controlled trial design, which is a strong method for determining cause and effect. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Intervention group and the Delayed Intervention group. Both groups used their smartphones as normal at the beginning of the study. Then, for the first two weeks, the Intervention group had their mobile internet access blocked, while the Delayed Intervention group continued to use their phones without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the following two weeks, the roles reversed: the Intervention group regained full mobile internet access, and the Delayed Intervention group had their mobile internet blocked. This “cross-over” design allowed researchers to compare the effects of blocking internet access against a baseline of normal use within the same individuals, and also to see if any positive effects persisted after internet access was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To block mobile internet access, participants in the intervention phases were instructed to install a smartphone application called Freedom. This application was set up to block all mobile internet access, including both Wi-Fi and cellular data, on their smartphones for two weeks. Importantly, the block specifically targeted internet access, while allowing participants to continue using their phones for text messages and phone calls. They could also still access the internet through other devices like desktop computers or laptops. This design allowed the researchers to isolate the impact of mobile internet access specifically, rather than completely disconnecting participants from all digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of this study was the objective tracking of whether participants actually adhered to the internet block. The Freedom application automatically recorded whether the internet block was active throughout the intervention period, providing a measure of compliance. Participants completed surveys and cognitive tests at three points in time: at the beginning of the study (baseline), after the first two weeks, and after four weeks. These assessments measured subjective well-being, mental health, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective well-being was measured using a standard model that includes three components: positive emotions, negative emotions, and satisfaction with life. Mental health was assessed using a range of measures designed to identify symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger, social anxiety, and difficulties in personality functioning. Attention was evaluated in two ways: through a self-report questionnaire that asked about attentional lapses and mind-wandering, and through an objective computer task called the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). The gradCPT is designed to measure sustained attention – the ability to maintain focus over time – by requiring participants to respond to certain images while withholding responses to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these main outcomes, the researchers also measured several factors that might explain why blocking mobile internet could lead to improvements. These potential mediating factors included social connectedness, feelings of self-control, how participants spent their time (categorized as time in the offline world, time on digital communication, and time consuming media), and sleep duration. Finally, they also assessed baseline levels of “Fear of Missing Out” (FoMO) and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to see if these factors influenced how much people benefited from the internet block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that blocking mobile internet access for two weeks had a positive impact on several aspects of psychological functioning. Participants in the Intervention group showed significant improvements in subjective well-being and mental health during the first two weeks when their internet was blocked. These improvements were observed as increases in positive emotions and life satisfaction, and decreases in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. Similarly, when the Delayed Intervention group had their internet blocked in the second two weeks, they also experienced comparable improvements in well-being and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding attention, both groups showed improvements in their ability to sustain attention, as measured by the objective gradCPT task, during their respective internet blocking periods. Participants also reported fewer attentional lapses and improved attentional awareness when mobile internet was restricted. Interestingly, for both well-being and mental health, the positive effects appeared to lessen somewhat after the internet block was removed, although well-being remained significantly higher than at the start of the study. However, for attentional awareness, the improvements seemed to persist even after mobile internet access was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the reasons behind these positive changes, the researchers examined the potential mediating factors. They found that the improvements in well-being, mental health, and attentional awareness could be partially explained by shifts in how people spent their time when they did not have mobile internet access. Specifically, during the internet block, participants reported spending more time engaging in offline activities such as socializing in person, exercising, and being in nature. They also spent less time consuming media. These changes in time use, along with increases in feelings of social connectedness and self-control, and even slightly improved sleep, appeared to contribute to the observed benefits of blocking mobile internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study explored whether certain individual characteristics influenced the effectiveness of the internet block. They found that individuals who reported higher levels of Fear of Missing Out at the start of the study experienced greater improvements in both subjective well-being and mental health when they blocked mobile internet. Similarly, those with more ADHD symptoms at the beginning of the study showed larger improvements in attentional awareness when their mobile internet was restricted. This suggests that people who are more prone to worrying about missing out online or who struggle with attention may benefit even more from taking breaks from constant mobile internet access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides valuable insights, it is important to consider its limitations. One limitation is that only about 25% of participants fully complied with the internet block throughout the entire two-week intervention period, based on a strict definition of compliance. However, even with this imperfect compliance, the researchers still observed significant positive effects, suggesting that even partial reductions in mobile internet use can be beneficial. Another limitation is that the study focused specifically on iPhone users, so it is not yet clear if the findings would generalize to users of other types of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build upon these findings by investigating the long-term effects of mobile internet restriction. It would also be valuable to explore these effects in different populations and to examine the optimal duration and strategies for internet restriction to maximize benefits. Further research could also investigate how different types of online content and activities contribute to the observed effects. Finally, a more in-depth examination of the specific mechanisms through which reduced mobile internet use leads to improvements in well-being and attention would further enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between our digital habits and our psychological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf017" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Blocking mobile internet on smartphones improves sustained attention, mental health, and subjective well-being&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Noah Castelo, Kostadin Kushlev, Adrian F.

            The number of measles cases linked to an outbreak in West Texas has grown to 58, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-18-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00023b5vuw8a4z2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases are centered in Gaines County, which is reporting 45 cases. Other surrounding areas are seeing spread of the illness too, with 9 cases in Terry County, two in Yoakum County, one in Lynn County and one in Lubbock County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00033b5v2axhbe7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cases are mostly in children ages 5 to 17. Although most of the cases are in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccination status is unknown, there were four cases of measles in people who said they had been vaccinated. No other details were immediately available about those four people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar6xjq00003b5vat7dt6n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In all of the cases, symptoms began in the past three weeks. Thirteen of the people have been hospitalized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00043b5vinfg4pr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Local health departments in West Texas are hosting free vaccination clinics for the community. There have been at least 95 measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations at a clinic hosted by the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, according to Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director. The clinic recently expanded its hours to be open seven days a week for vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00053b5v4dz7p1yy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given how contagious measles is, health officials warn that cases may continue to rise in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00063b5vlho3wu0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an airborne illness that can cause rash, fever, red eyes and cough. Severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain. In some cases, the illness can be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00073b5vjcr3ea8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7aratks000m3b5vsro9f2by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other affected Texas counties also fall below the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the MMR vaccine, a threshold set by the US Department of Health and Human Services to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. Lynn, Lubbock and Yoakum counties all stand around 92%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00093b5vsuvfxf3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Eight cases of measles have also been detected in Lea County, New Mexico, which borders Gaines County, Texas, the New Mexico Department of Health said. The agency has not confirmed any direct contact with the Texas cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7auvgse00003b5v47wiggc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The five newest cases, reported Tuesday, are in a single family that is isolating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7auzqyp00023b5v11c2u1eg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the eight total cases in Lea County, six are in unvaccinated people. The other two people believe they were vaccinated, according to Robert Nott, the state health department communications director. None of the eight has been hospitalized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7avhej600023b6ml9plc1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The New Mexico health department is also holding free vaccination clinics for Lea County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There were 285 measles cases reported in the US last year, the most since 2019, according to the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2016%20outbreaks,59)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarification:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story has been updated to reflect that the four Texas patients who were vaccinated self-reported their status, according to the state health department.&lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — With egg prices soaring, the Trump administration is planning a new strategy for fighting bird flu that stresses vaccinations and tighter biosecurity instead of killing off millions of chickens when the disease strikes a flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government will seek “better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on” rather than the current standard practice of destroying all the birds on a farm when an infection is detected, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasset said the administration planned to announce further details this week. He said they were “working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world,” to get the plan ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to messages Tuesday seeking more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally when chickens or turkeys start dying from the disease, officials will “depopulate,” or destroy all the birds on the farm to prevent it from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the resulting culling of millions of chickens per month has caused egg prices to skyrocket, with shortages that have led some retailers to ration sales. The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities hit $4.95 in January, and the USDA predicts it will soar another 20% this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassett didn’t provide many details of how the Trump administration’s new approach would work. But he said it would involve a “better, smarter perimeter” around poultry farms. He said it doesn’t make sense to kill all the chickens inside that perimeter when the disease is being spread by wild ducks and geese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told “Fox and Friends” that her first briefing after being sworn in was on bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are looking at every possible scenario to ensure that we are doing everything we can in a safe, secure manner but also to ensure that Americans have the food that they need,” Rollins told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poultry industry has long resisted vaccinating flocks against bird flu because of the potential impacts on export markets, as well as the expense. Most U.S. trading partners won’t accept exports from countries that allow vaccinations due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We support the administration and their goals to bring down food inflation and cut regulatory red tape and hopefully eliminate this virus,” said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, which represents the broiler industry which produces chickens for meat. But he said in an interview that producers need ”robust trade protection” to ensure they don’t lose markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders of the Congressional Chicken Caucus said in a letter to Rollins last week that while the egg industry has lost the most birds, the broiler industry could bear a disproportionate share of the costs of any policy change. According to USDA figures 77.5% of the nearly 159 million commercial birds lost to avian influenza since February 2022 have been layers, or over 123 million. That compares to 13.7 million broilers, or 8.6%, and 18.7 million turkeys, or 11.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza vaccines have long been available. Animal health company Zoetis announced on Friday that it had received a conditional license from the USDA for a new vaccine. But using it would be up to federal authorities in partnership with the industry, the company said in a statement. Other manufacturers are also working on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota, said tighter biosecurity to prevent cross-contamination and limit outbreaks to one barn “requires an incredible amount of work on the ground,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I’ve seen it work,” Cardona said in an interview. “I’ve seen it fail dramatically in other cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For “precision depopulation” to work, she said, there must be effective barriers to transmission between barns, such as ensuring that farm workers don’t carry the virus on their boots or clothes. And workers need to be alert for the earliest signs of abnormal deaths, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another barrier is the logistical difficulty in giving shots to up to 3 million birds or more at a single egg farm. Current vaccines are all injectables. Farms might opt to limit them to new pullets coming onto a farm, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines that could be economically administered through a farm’s water supply would require new innovations, Cardona said. But until there’s a market for vaccines, she said, there won’t be an incentive to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s technology isn’t where were going to be for long, but it’s where we’re at,” Cardona said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of sticking to a known successful approach, they subtly modify their responses based on their most recent experience. This ongoing exploration may help them adapt to changing environments or discover better strategies over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that subjects predicted event timing using a hazard model but still adjusted based on prior trials. The findings suggest that exploration is an inherent strategy in decision-making, even when it leads to unnecessary errors. The study also supports the use of marmosets as models for autism research by confirming their similarity to human cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploration Tendency:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans and marmosets adjust their behavior based on previous trials, even after mastering a task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; This behavior may help organisms remain flexible in uncertain environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support using marmosets as models for studying prediction differences in autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe it’s a life hack or a liability, or a little of both. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprising result in a new MIT study may suggest that people and animals alike share an inherent propensity to keep updating their approach to a task even when they have already learned how they should approach it and even if the deviations sometimes lead to unnecessary error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of “exploring” when one could just be “exploiting,” could make sense for at least two reasons, said Mriganka Sur, senior author of the study published Feb. 18 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107870"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man at a computer and a marmoset." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-exploration-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mathematical modeling of the reaction time data revealed that both the humans and marmosets were letting the results of the immediate previous trial influence what they did on the next trial, even though they had already learned what to do. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a task’s rules seem set one moment doesn’t mean they’ll stay that way in this uncertain world, so altering behavior from the optimal condition every so often could help reveal needed adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, trying new things when you already know what you like is a way of finding out whether there might be something even better out there than the good thing you’ve got going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the goal is to maximize reward, you should never deviate once you have found the perfect solution, yet you keep exploring,” said Sur, Paul and Lilah Newton Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why? It’s like food. We all like certain foods, but we still keep trying different foods because you never know, there might be something you could discover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former research technician Tudor Dragoi, now a graduate student at Boston University, led the study in which he and fellow members of the Sur Lab explored how humans and marmosets, a small primate, make predictions about event timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three humans and two marmosets were given a simple task. They’d see an image on a screen for some amount of time—the amount of time varied from one trial to the next within a limited range—and they simply had to hit a button (marmosets poked a tablet while humans clicked a mouse) when the image disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success was defined as reacting as quickly as possible to the image’s disappearance without hitting the button too soon. Marmosets received a juice reward on successful trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though marmosets needed more training time than humans, the subjects all settled into the same reasonable pattern of behavior regarding the task. The longer the image stayed on the screen, the faster their reaction time to its disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavior follows the “hazard model” of prediction in which, if the image can only last for so long, the longer it’s still there, the more likely it must be to disappear very soon. The subjects learned this and overall, with more experience, their reaction times became faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the experiment continued, Sur and Dragoi’s team noticed something surprising was also going on. Mathematical modeling of the reaction time data revealed that both the humans and marmosets were letting the results of the immediate previous trial influence what they did on the next trial, even though they had already learned what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the image was only on the screen briefly in one trial, on the next round subjects would decrease reaction time a bit (presumably expecting a shorter image duration again) whereas if the image lingered, they’d increase reaction time (presumably because they figured they’d have a longer wait).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those results add to ones from a similar study Sur’s lab published in 2023 in which they found that even after mice learned the rules of a different cognitive task, they’d arbitrarily deviate from the winning strategy every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that study, like this one, learning the successful strategy didn’t prevent subjects from continuing to test alternatives, even if it meant sacrificing reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The persistence of behavioral changes even after task learning may reflect exploration as a strategy for seeking and setting on an optimal internal model of the environment,” the scientists wrote in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevance for autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarity of the human and marmoset behaviors is an important finding as well, Sur said. That’s because differences in making predictions about one’s environment is posited to be a salient characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because marmosets are small, are inherently social, and are more cognitively advanced than mice, work has begun in some labs to establish marmoset autism models, but a key component was establishing that they model autism-related behaviors well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating that marmosets model neurotypical human behavior regarding predictions, the study therefore adds weight to the emerging idea that marmosets can indeed provide informative models for autism studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Dragoi and Sur, other authors of the paper are Hiroki Sugihara, Nhat Le, Elie Adam, Jitendra Sharma, Guoping Feng and Robert Desimone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative supported the research through the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a2e2b3c232e20250a27233e642f2e3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.01.052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Global to local influences on temporal expectation in marmosets and humans&lt;/a&gt;” by Mriganka Sur et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global to local influences on temporal expectation in marmosets and humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marmosets are emerging rapidly as experimental models for studying the neural bases of cognition and, importantly, for modeling disorders of human cognition, but many aspects of their mental attributes remain to be characterized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When judging elapsed time, humans implicitly use prior information to predict upcoming events and reduce perceptual and decision-making uncertainty. An influential model of temporal expectation is the hazard rate model, which posits the likelihood of an event occurring in the future, provided it has not occurred already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that marmosets trained on a reaction time task acquire the hazard rate model of expectation, consistent with the global task structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model emerges progressively with learning but unexpectedly continues to be modified by local contingencies, as demonstrated by a serial effect of trial duration on responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined effects of global and local task structure are well described by a multiple regression model and computationally by Bayesian updating of the hazard function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel experiments in human subjects similarly demonstrate global followed by local influences on reaction times and temporal expectation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, in both marmosets and humans, task history and local structure continuously update task-specific responses, surprisingly at the expense of optimal responses after the competent acquisition of an internal model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:02:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1fVDJoZXBwcWQxWHRTeVBGa1FxdmFmV1R1eVYyWU1ZMURNRXludkRIdjI1bzhmZUt4X2pTQkhWSXdMbU5Scm51VktZdEZ3VmdWOWktWDg3VDRSS1ZQdlpvWkkwT1h5RFZSZkNzQkIyenhqSFlsSGU0cw</guid></item><item><title>Minnesota declares state of emergency as diseases cripple Midwestern farms - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPN29sWWJhUkNKU3FtTHNsdWkyaFlVOUJXN1BENmkzOXRzdUhXeWhaTzZ2emNLQlV1LWJFMTlLcDBfd1oyZXl6NGRMOGNjWTBobkVCQ2FYdU1PdTkxU19ObVN6R0MzRFN5Rkk1cVlZOFlnUkhSakFQdnlpcEdSQmtUUGpaMEE4NnZBQXdwclRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Minnesota has declared a state of emergency as multiple strains of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/cold-and-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bird flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; have ravaged farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) stated in a press release that the Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s Rural Finance Authority (RFA) Board established the emergency following three outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those included avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and the H5N1 flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-bird-flu-strain-detected-nevada-dairy-worker-cdc-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Bird Flu Strain Detected In Nevada Dairy Worker, Cdc Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Bird Flu Strain Detected In Nevada Dairy Worker, Cdc Says&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The state of emergency allows Minnesota farmers who have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/birds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:livestock losses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;livestock losses&lt;/a&gt; to access funds through zero-interest disaster recovery loans, according to the above source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fran Miron feeds his cows at his farm on Sept. 5, 2019, in Hugo, Minnesota.

&lt;p&gt;Three more infections were confirmed in Gaines County, which has been the epicenter and now has 45 cases. Six more measles cases were reported in neighboring Terry County. And Lubbock County has its first case. Cases have now been detected in five Texas counties, all in the same region in west-central Texas near the border with New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of patients hospitalized remained at 13. Four patients were vaccinated, and the remaining patients were unvaccinated or their status is unknown. Roughly half of the cases involve school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities," the TDSHS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Probe continues in neighboring New Mexico county&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the New Mexico Department of Health declared a measles outbreak in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. Officials said ties to the Texas outbreak are suspected but haven't been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health department in other states are closely monitoring developments in Texas and have urged parents to ensure that their children are up to date with measles vaccine doses. In a &lt;a href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/blog/2025/02/nr-18.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; today, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) warned of an uptick in cases in several states, including Texas and Georgia, and noted how contagious the virus is: Infected people can spread measles for as long as 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Landers, MD, ADPH chief medical officer, said, "One of the main messages we want to emphasize is that measles follows a pattern in which the child first develops fever, cough, runny nose, and watery/red eyes, then a rash develops. Persons can start spreading the virus up to four days before symptoms appear, and those with weak immune systems can spread the measles virus longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers’ goal? To find out whether the two experiences overlapped—and, if so, whether DMT could be the brain’s own way of rowing us into the great beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt; “There is good indirect evidence to suggest that DMT is released in greater quantities at the point of death in the human brain. We have evidence from animal brains, but we don’t have any direct evidence from humans. However, we can infer that this also happens,” says David Luke, Ph.D., a co-author of the 2023 study and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Greenwich in London.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The scientists found experiences with the psychedelic drugs and NDE encounters had a lot in common, “offering insights into &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a63138306/ancient-egyptians-got-high-with-bes-mugs/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a63138306/ancient-egyptians-got-high-with-bes-mugs/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="altered states of consciousness" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;altered states of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;,” explains Pascal Michael, Ph.D., another co-author of the 2023 study and a psychology lecturer at the University of Greenwich. “These include mystical experiences characterized by feelings of unity and timelessness, ego dissolution where a sense of self merges with a larger reality, and encounters with entities or presences.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the idea of DMT as the chemical behind NDEs is compelling, it’s just one part of a much larger puzzle. According to Luke, the brain at the point of death is undergoing a cascade of neurochemical changes, including massive releases of serotonin and noradrenaline, which are brain chemicals that help regulate mood, emotions, and stress. In other words, DMT could indeed be a psychopomp—a creature, spirit, or deity that transports the newly deceased to the afterlife—Luke suggests. But the story of death doesn’t end there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Michael explains that the brain’s biological state during NDEs might shape these experiences differently than psychedelics do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“The neurobiological context of NDEs—potentially involving hypoxia [lack of oxygen in the body or brain], hypercapnia [too much carbon dioxide in the blood], and endogenous neurochemical release—might differ from the effects of 5-MeO-DMT,” he says. This distinction could influence the experiential content, with NDEs more likely to evoke autobiographical and relational memories tied to loved ones. “By contrast, 5-MeO-DMT tends to induce archetypal or abstract encounters, perhaps due to its intense focus on ego dissolution and the broader existential dimensions of experience,” Michael says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In his seminal book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278?tag=popularmechanics_auto-append-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DMT: The Spirit Molecule" data-vars-ga-product-id="5f5c6617-9df8-4655-b4d8-2e85b30ff8e3" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278?tag=popularmechanics_auto-append-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/rh2C/www-amazon-com-product-not-found-500-https-www-amazon-com-dmt-molecule-revolutionary-near-death-experiences-dp-0892819278","site_id":"a4f9566a-1fd0-484c-b731-150b9bda9ffa","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278?tag=popularmechanics_auto-append-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278?tag=pop-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278?tag=pop-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="6b96aa51-3945-4690-9a24-e4bea15f4e3c" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-1kk1geb e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2000), Dr. Rick Strassman, a psychiatrist and clinical researcher, attributed spiritual connotations to DMT by virtue of the engrossing and transcendent experiences it induces.

DMT is structurally similar to serotonin, and has been detected in human blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, but most of the research is in animal models. “They can have distinctly different ways of producing neurotransmitters and metabolizing compounds,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In any case, the notion that a molecule within us might serve as the final boatman across the River Styx is as haunting as it is fascinating, opening a Pandora’s box of questions about the greatest mysteries of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/3982ef5c-4a25-489d-884c-34bf21f33bc2_1560194184.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Stav Dimitropoulos" title="Headshot of Stav Dimitropoulos" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1pt1ks2 ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stav Dimitropoulos’s science writing has appeared online or in print for the BBC, Discover, Scientific American, Nature, Science, Runner’s World, The Daily Beast and others.

Certainly genetics play a role, as does a little bit of luck. That said, lifestyle factors, such as nutrition habits and physical activity, definitely matter too. With so much nutrition and health information out there, it’s hard to know what we should actually be doing to add length (and quality!) to our lives. Fortunately, there’s one style of eating that may help. Research links following the super-popular &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-diets-2025-8767671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; with a longer “healthy life expectancy,” meaning it may extend the number of years someone lives without chronic diseases or injuries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wondering how to start? Follow this seven-day Mediterranean diet meal plan to help promote longevity.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This meal plan incorporates the principles of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; by including a wide variety of plant-based foods, such vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains. You’ll also find an array of protein-rich foods, like fish, shellfish, soy, poultry, eggs and dairy. We limit refined grains, such as white flour, and added sugars as well as processed meats.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each day provides an average of 99 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. Protein is often emphasized for its role in satiety and muscle growth, and protein intake also plays a pivotal role in healthy aging. Research shows that adequate protein intake in middle age, especially from plant-based sources, increases the odds of healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We also include an average of 33 grams of fiber per day. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is an important nutrient with many health benefits, and research shows that it can play an important role in supporting a long, healthy life. One study found that high fiber intake reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adults with hypertension, while another study showed that high fiber consumption improved cognitive function in adults over age 60.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, go for it! The breakfasts range from 374 to 453 calories, while the lunches span 413 to 535 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two to fit your personal nutrition goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating that prioritizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes. It also includes plenty of fish and healthy fats, such as olive oil and avocado. Poultry, eggs, dairy and meat are included in the Mediterranean diet, but typically with less emphasis than plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_185-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_187-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shellfish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poultry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Herbs and spices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_188-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-help-promote-longevity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_189-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Help Promote Longevity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_190-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no one strategy that will guarantee greater longevity, it’s clear that some nutrition and lifestyle factors can help increase the length and quality of our years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_191-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_192-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Protein intake in middle age, especially from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; sources, increases the odds of healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adequate protein intake is particularly important for older adults. Eating sufficient protein helps prevent and delay age-related muscle loss, which is important because good muscle tone and strength can help preserve good balance and reduce fall risk as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating plenty of fiber can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Research also links a high-fiber diet with improved cognitive function in adults over 60.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include beans, whole grains, nuts, seeds and many fruits and vegetables.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;The Mediterranean diet is continuously applauded for its &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. And, research links following this healthy eating plan with an increased number of healthy years lived. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity can improve the chances of healthy aging, and staying active can help prevent or delay the loss of both physical and cognitive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024858/walking-plan-to-reduce-stress/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;The Best Walking Plan to Help You Reduce Stress&lt;/a&gt; to get started. &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THMs can be harmful if either consumed or inhaled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They easily evaporate from water and breathing them in or absorbing them through the skin while drinking, cooking, washing dishes, or swimming can prove dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is still a lot scientists don't know about THMs. The exact amount of THM exposure considered carcinogenic is not universally agreed upon and can depend on many factors, such as the concentration in drinking water and the duration of time a person is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exposure to high concentrations of chemical byproducts, especially over long periods, is believed to pose the greatest health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 report in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/115/12/1597/7238786?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; investigated the link between exposure to THMs in drinking water and colorectal cancer in nearly 59,000 men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After nearly 17 years, there were 1,913 new cases of CRC. For men, higher levels of THMs in drinking water (15 ppb or higher) were linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer, with a 26 percent higher risk compared to those with no exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rise of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 over the last two decades.

&lt;p&gt;One family’s breakthrough may provide hope for thousands of parents who’ve been told their children will never talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When their son, Mason, now 5, was diagnosed with nonverbal autism at 2 1/2 years old, the Connor family was determined to find something to help him speak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After multiple failed treatments, Mason’s father, Joe, came across a study by &lt;a href="https://autismdiscovery.org/index.php/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Richard Frye&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric neurologist who was researching experimental treatments for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/new-study-takes-on-another-myth-about-what-causes-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;children with autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researching treatments for nonverbal autism, Mason’s family came across one doctor’s research on leucovorin. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CBS News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frye suggested trying leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug that is commonly prescribed to cancer patients to allay the effects of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just three days later, Mason said his first words. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Leucovorin is made from folic acid, also called vitamin B9, which occurs in the form of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/health/most-of-the-world-isnt-getting-enough-key-nutrients-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt; in foods such as leafy greens, Brussels sprouts, and avocados. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some research has shown that many children with autism have low folate levels in their brains, a condition known as cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). Other studies indicate that a significant number of children with autism possess antibodies that can interfere with folate transport into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might help explain why the drug may help children with autism with their communication issues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mason was diagnosed with nonverbal autism when he was 2 years old. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Caroline Connor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,” Frye &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/autism-leucovorin-medicine-folic-acid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told CBS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done the science, and the next step is that we want to get more funding so we can actually get it FDA approved,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That science includes his 2020 study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071909120300462" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Seminars in Pediatric Neurology&lt;/a&gt;. It found that of the 44 children with both autism and folate receptor alpha autoantibodies, two thirds treated with the drug showed language improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2016168" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; he published in 2018 involved 48 children with autism and language impairment who were given either leucovorin or a placebo. After 12 weeks, those who took the medication showed “improvement in measures of verbal communication” as compared with those on the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“We’ve done the science, and the next step is that we want to get more funding so we can actually get it FDA approved,” said Dr. Richard Frye. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ingenus Pharmaceutical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Mason’s not the only child whose parents have spoken out about success with leucovorin. One little girl named Meghan, who underwent a clinical trial at the &lt;a href="https://www.phoenixchildrens.org/centers-programs/barrow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children’s&lt;/a&gt;, saw improvement in language, communication, behavior and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were almost convinced she was taking [leucovorin calcium in the first phase] because we saw significant changes within two weeks of her starting the study,” her mother &lt;a href="https://phoenixchildrensfoundation.org/moments/bold-ideas/pioneering-new-treatments-for-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Marie said&lt;/a&gt;. “It was pretty dramatic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s improved our family life tremendously,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there’s a catch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Leucovorin’s an old drug and you can get it for a very low price,” Frye said. “So nobody is going to make a lot of money on it. So there’s no reason for them to invest.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that, for now, the medication can only be prescribed for autism “off-label”— which is when a drug is prescribed for a condition that differs from its FDA-approved purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, around 1 in 36 children have autism spectrum disorder in the United States, an increase from the 1 in 44 estimate in 2018.  &lt;/p&gt;

A new Yale study reveals significant differences between the gut microbiomes of individuals recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS)—an autoimmune disease that impacts the central nervous system—and healthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, published recently in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200355"&gt;&lt;em class="arx-italic-text"&gt;Neurology Neuroimmunology &amp;amp; Neuroinflammation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, identified gut bacteria that had significantly different levels of abundance in patients with MS. It also found that, compared to healthy individuals, those with MS had a smaller number of bacteria coated in an antibody known as host immunoglobulin A (IgA). These antibodies are pumped into the gut by immune cells that live in the mucosa—the soft tissue that lines the intestines—and they bind to specific groups of bacteria, triggering their removal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact that fewer bacteria were coated with IgA in patients with MS suggests that there is perhaps a fundamental disconnect going on with the host-microbe interactions,” says &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/erin-longbrake/"&gt;Erin Longbrake, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of neurology and the study’s principal investigator. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists still haven’t discovered the cause of MS, but emerging research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/multiple-sclerosis-ms#:~:text=While%20the%20cause%20of%20MS,interaction%20between%20genes%20and%20environment.%E2%80%9D"&gt;environmental risk factors&lt;/a&gt; that stem from outside the body, such as poor diet and smoking, can contribute to the development of the disease. This makes the microbiome an intriguing area of study to learn how multiple sclerosis develops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The microbiome interfaces with the environment as well as the immune system,” says Longbrake. “Theoretically, the environmental risk factors could predispose people to MS because they change the bugs that are in the gut.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MS associated with smaller proportion of IgA-coated bacteria &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 43 people who were newly diagnosed with MS and had not started any sort of immune therapy to treat the disorder, as well as 42 healthy controls, all of whom gave stool samples. The researchers first isolated the bacteria from these samples. They then divided the bacteria into those bound with IgA and those that were not and measured the abundance of the various bacteria species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that patients who had been recently diagnosed with MS had a significantly smaller proportion of gut bacteria coated in IgA. They also identified differences in the specific bacteria that populated the gut in these patients. Some of these bacteria had been identified in prior research. For example, the researchers observed that species of &lt;em class="arx-italic-text"&gt;Faecalibacterium &lt;/em&gt;were less abundant in patients with MS, which was in line with previous findings. They also discovered new differences, such as a species of &lt;em class="arx-italic-text"&gt;Monoglobus &lt;/em&gt;that was more abundant in untreated MS patients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the 43 people with MS, 19 gave the researchers an additional stool sample six months after starting B-cell depletion therapy—a treatment that destroys immune cells that contribute to autoimmune diseases. The gut microbiomes of these patients, the research team found, more closely resembled the microbiomes of healthy controls than they had pre-treatment. “This gives us some clues into the mechanisms underlying how this type of drug works to treat MS,” Longbrake says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings might help explain why some people develop MS, but not others. Scientists could also potentially one day use patterns of microbes in the gut as biomarkers for predicting who is most at risk. “We’re still analyzing what our results mean and how we can use this information to improve care,” says Longbrake. “These are areas to investigate in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class="arx-italic-text"&gt;The research reported in this news article was supported by the National Institutes of Health (awards K23NS107624, P01AI073748, U19AI089992, U24 AI11867, R01AI22220, UM1HG009390, P01AI039671, P50CA121974, and R01CA227473).

The Americas were declared free of endemic measles by 2016, but suffered a setback two years later due to a gap in vaccines in one country, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;scientists say&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the disease is so contagious, it requires at least 95 percent of a local population to be vaccinated in order to prevent its spread, they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious virus can cause respiratory and neurological problems, pneumonia, vomiting, and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin, the state of New Jersey said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet. Measles can also cause serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and can lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth, or a low-birth-weight baby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state said, "Those who may have been exposed or who suspect illness should call their health care provider first before arriving at any facility so that necessary infection prevention precautions can be taken to protect other patients and staff. NJDOH is working in collaboration with local health officials on ongoing contact tracing and on efforts to notify people who might have been exposed and to identify additional exposures that may have occurred."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They noted, "The virus spreads easily through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Individuals at risk include those who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past," they noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, no additional associated cases have been identified in New Jersey, they said. An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It may even put you at risk for cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study, led by UC San Francisco researchers, found that older, healthy volunteers, with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, showed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency. These levels were associated with more damage to the brain’s white matter – the nerve fibers that enable communication between areas of the brain – and test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--half-right"&gt;
&lt;p class="blockquote-content__text"&gt;We need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.27200"&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Feb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers led by senior author &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/ari.green"&gt;Ari J. Green&lt;/a&gt;, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the &lt;a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/"&gt;Weill Institute for Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt;, said that the results raise questions about current B12 requirements and suggest the recommendations need updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. “Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lower B12 correlates with slower processing speeds, brain lesions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize. In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants’ white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could “impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize.” Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” she said. “Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

Among those, flu claimed the lives of 563 people 64 or older and 11 people 18 or younger, including several teens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, people are being hospitalized due to severe complications triggered by the illness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In deadly pediatric cases, patients experienced neurologic complications, including brain swelling. Among adults hospitalized with the flu, specialists are seeing an increase in cases of pneumonia caused by MRSA, a flesh-eating superbug bacteria, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/flu-season-hospitalizations-mrsa-ane/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot of MRSA pneumonia and really bad MRSA pneumonia after influenza, so what we call necrotizing, where you’re getting a lot of destruction of the lung tissue,” said Dr. John Lynch, an infectious disease specialist at UW Medicine told CNN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The flu is spreading at very high rates in California, accounting for nearly 27 percent of clinical lab detections statewide and 3.4 percent of total deaths for the week ending Feb. 8, the most recent reporting available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-image="73734-1739904137" data-src="https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/73734/20250218/014216/styles/raw/public/processed_images/FLU.png" data-sizes="(min-width: 780px) 726px, 100vw" data-srcset="https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/73734/20250218/014216/styles/raw/public/processed_images/FLU.png?width=640 640w, https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/73734/20250218/014216/styles/raw/public/processed_images/FLU.png?width=726 726w"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walgreensbootsalliance.com%2Fwalgreens-flu-index&amp;amp;esheet=54206751&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250214616891&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Walgreens+Flu+Index&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=1577548178756b4f5be57ac1e33c5ec1" rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank"&gt;Walgreens Flu Index&lt;/a&gt; an online, interactive tool that tracks weekly flu activity based on prescription data, shows that overall, U.S. flu activity is 204% higher compared to the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s most concerning is not the number of cases but the number of hospitalizations and outpatient visits that we are seeing,” said Anita Pael, vice president of pharmacy services development at Walgreens said in a Walgreens news release. “I don’t believe cases have peaked yet, so it’s critical for people to remember to wash their hands frequently, and if you’re feeling symptoms, get tested right away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most positive influenza specimens are type A, which traditional impact the young and the old hardest. Both H1 and H3 strains are circulating, the CDPH reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flu activity previously peaked in mid-December statewide. It started climbing again in mid-January reaching it's highest point in early February, according to national data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State health experts are reminding people that it's not too late to get the flu shot. According to the CDC, only an estimated 45 percent of adults have received the flu shot this year. Knowing the flu is spreading at high rates across California, residents should be taking pains to wash their hands frequently, stay home when feeling ill, and wear masks around vulnerable people, health officials advise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antiviral drugs are available to treat the flu, but they are most effective when administered at the first sign of flu symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:49:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPdVdTeFpiNldMc2xRYTQwUHp5bHNVc0lyenFxMzhUUHhSSWVOV1hZUU9nelIyQWlSU0Z6N3kwUzk3WXk2VXVScWd0ZmFHUlZMXzcxLWJIMWNYMWN4TkprY21NZmgwNXZVVHNUZGE0LW1JY1p3MDBfRFlfbU9wemU5andSaHBMaXB5b2Zoa2J2LVQ1VmNNS3JzRUFB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9iaXB4TUdIWV9qYk04TjJ0NzBTYnZzWUhwS0F2OHdXTERpUVhISWdxSDNwRHBlUkZHLTBPa3pfR2EwOVZlWDJOZGxoMVFrOVRMZWR3MEFtajhuN3AzMGZSdTJrRDBKazAyaXpmYUgxRWFJaDNPb1g1dGZLUFI4aDJ0R2RpWEdUUGZldVFPd3ZzVXZFSDZCaV94RDNtUmpkZlllcU1veHlDZHpOSQ</guid></item><item><title>A pediatrician warns of 'long lasting' consequences of RFK Jr. leading HHS - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOd2FmS3ZSc1djX2hYU2tKbWFfOVd5Z3BDckcyVmV6NUdFa1lxaDdqenAySm54UG5zTlZtQTU0TjhvdnVUTmpmOTk2OW1QRmtTa3NkNmZlUmJkZm1iZkN5Umh4cHM3QzlzYkZ2ZVlPNWRhMkJ2ekY0NHRrV2dZMERtT21Va1lCMUVkcktFcGhieEpLb1lDak10Qmh3dC16eF9uN3h1U3B4c1EtNnpLdHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5294591/rfk-jr-trump-health-human-services-hhs-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;takes the helm&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Health and Human Services, infectious disease specialist and pediatrician Dr. Adam Ratner is weighing in with serious concerns. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Speaking on behalf of himself, and not the organizations he is affiliated with, Ratner says: "It's very disturbing that someone who has spent so much of his career trying to undermine confidence in vaccines, trying to tear down the infrastructure that approves and recommends vaccines, has the potential to be in a position of power over the infrastructure that has those goals."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Though Kennedy has declared that he's not "&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt;," he's also repeatedly questioned the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;measles and other infections diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Ratner says he's worried about vaccine availability going forward, but also about the public's overall confidence in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As mentors of mine have said many times over the years, 'it is much easier to scare people than to un-scare them,' " Ratner says. "And I think that just by elevating anti-vaccine views in the guise of RFK, I think that we risk a crisis in vaccine confidence in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ratner notes that measles, once considered a "solved problem" due to a widespread vaccination effort, has been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down" target="_blank"&gt;making a comeback&lt;/a&gt; in recent years: "It was a thing that we had had a vaccine for since the mid-1960s and that we very, very rarely saw ... And then in 2018 and 2019, we had a huge measles outbreak in New York City with about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160662/" target="_blank"&gt;650 cases&lt;/a&gt; and some kids who were very, very sick."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his new book, &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots,&lt;/em&gt; Ratner makes the case that our ability to control measles is a test of how strong our public health institutions are — which makes the resurgence of the disease especially troubling. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When we start to see measles, it's evidence of the faltering of our public health systems and of fomenting of distrust of vaccines," he says. "I am worried that actions taken in the next year or two years may have long lasting effects on the health of children, not just in the United States, but I think worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Interview highlights&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; On why measles is so hard to control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Measles is the most contagious disease that we know of. It is more contagious than flu. It is more contagious than polio. It's more contagious than Ebola. It's more contagious than COVID. In a susceptible population, measles can infect, you know, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20measles%2C%20up,days%20after%20the%20rash%20appears." target="_blank"&gt;90% of the population&lt;/a&gt; easily. If someone with measles walks into a room of people who have not been vaccinated and haven't had measles before, 90% of those people will get infected with measles from that one person. And that is much more infectious than most things that we generally deal with. Measles is an indicator for whether there is vaccination going on, whether people are protected because it is so very infectious.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the lasting impact of anti-vaccine messaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;We live in a time when children, for the most part, grow up happy and healthy and where infectious diseases that used to kill large numbers of children have been brought under control through vaccines — and that has been through a tremendous amount of work. And some of that has been scientific work. But some of that has also been policy work in building an infrastructure that can withstand fluctuations in funding and can provide support for getting vaccines to children whose families may not be able to afford them, and all sorts of other things that have been built over time. The successes that we have, and the point that we are at in children's public health, is not guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On being surprised by the divided public reaction to the COVID vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The pandemic we all experienced together, but we each experienced in kind of a different way. … I remembered the moment I got my first dose of the mRNA vaccine. I remember the day my wife got hers. I cried. I cried when my daughter got hers because I felt like we had won. Like I felt like science had saved us, vaccine science had saved us. In the back of my mind. I thought, this is the end of the anti-vaccine movement. Like, how do they possibly recover from everyone in the world seeing what we can do? And of course, looking back now, five years after the start of the pandemic, I was naive and I was wrong at that time about how the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/04/1173697394/as-the-pandemic-winds-down-anti-vaccine-activists-are-building-a-legal-network" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine movement would respond to the COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and where we would be just a few years later. ... &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;COVID vaccines saved millions and millions of lives and they are an incredible success story. And amazingly, that's not the story that is generally being told. And it's not the story that most people believe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the possible implications of Trump administration's cuts to NIH funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The biomedical research enterprise in the United States is incredible. And there have been advances that have helped all Americans. And we would never have had the COVID-19 vaccines without NIH research. We would never have the chemotherapies that we have or the gene therapies that are emerging to cure diseases. All of those advances are built on the back of NIH-funded basic research. It is absolutely critical to people's health in both the short and the long term. I think that the executive order &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/10/nx-s1-5292161/trump-administration-makes-deep-cuts-to-science-funding" target="_blank"&gt;capping NIH indirect costs at 15%&lt;/a&gt; and making it effective immediately and applied to existing grants is going to be an enormous budgetary strain on universities and other research institutions. And it has the potential to have people lose their jobs, to drive scientists out of the field, to have universities shut down labs that they can't afford to run because they haven't budgeted for this abrupt change. And I think that the effects of this may be long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On fighting two wars — one against pathogens and another against disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resnx-s1-5300174-105" class="bucketwrap pullquote"&gt;
            
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;It is a different world than it was in the stories that I told about the measles vaccine development and vaccines for children and things like that, where there were limited news sources, there was often collaboration between public health entities and news outlets. And now we're in a very different situation where there is unlimited information, much of it is bad, some of it is malicious. …&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I think there certainly does need to be direct countering of misinformation and disinformation that are put out there by anti-vaccine groups. And that is something that CDC and public health departments should be doing. But there's also the direct outreach to individual families and to communities and bringing good information and being willing to sit and listen to what people have heard and try to help them disentangle the bad information that they may have gotten and to explain the science-based information that hopefully your pediatricians and your trusted community members are bringing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sam Briger and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

channel Project Unity that the scientists 'saw everything go away and got [this burst] of activity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That could be the near-death experience or it could be the soul leaving the body perhaps,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hameroff believes that consciousness happens at a deeper quantum level, arguing it comes from quantum processes inside microtubules (tiny structures in brain cells) rather than just from large-scale electrical signals between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could explain why people still have awareness in low-energy brain states, like anesthesia, deep sleep or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13872881/I-died-operating-table-entered-state-life-death-saw-different-Id-taught-Catholic-Church.html"&gt;even near-death experiences&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers of the study said the most possible explanation would be that the bursts were released when the brain was deprived of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study analyzed brain activity of patients taken off life support, finding a burst of activity even though their blood pressure and heart rate was zero&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hameroff discussed the theory on The Science Channel's documentary series Through the Wormhole, saying: 'Let's say the heart stops beating, the blood stops flowing; the microtubules lose their quantum state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The quantum information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can't be destroyed, and it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If the patient is resuscitated, or revived, this quantum information can go back into the microtubules and the patient says 'I had a near-death experience.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they're not revived, and the patient dies, it's possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely, as a soul.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the majority of the scientific believes consciousness to be a product of complex interactions within the brain, arising from intricate neural networks processing information and creating a unified subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study he was referring to, conducted in 2009 by scientists from George Washington University, set out to see the level of consciousness at the end of life in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We report a case series of seven patients who were neurologically intact before the decision to withdraw care due to extensive systemic critical illness,' reads the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients included two males and five females, ranging in age from 34 to 74. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team conducted an electroencephalogram (EEG) on each of the patients as they were set to be taken off life support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Stuart Hameroff, anesthesiologist and professor at the University of Arizona, recently discussed the study, saying the burst of activity may have been the soul leaving the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the patients' EEG became isoelectric, or flatlined, the patient was pronounced dead, and the device was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The raw data captured the moment of death which was then followed by a spike of energy lasting from one to 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hameroff told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/TheProjectUnity/status/1891784391610782181"&gt;The Project Unity &lt;/a&gt;that after one patient's heart stopped beating, their brain showed a sudden burst of high-frequency activity called gamma synchrony that lasted 30 to 90 seconds 'and then it's gone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gamma synchrony is a type of brain wave pattern linked to conscious thought, awareness, and perception - the kind of activity that happens when you're thinking or processing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that even after the heart had stopped, the brain briefly showed signs that could be linked to awareness or consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[The scientists] raise the possibility that the measured post-cardiac death brain activity might correlate with [near death experiences/out-of-body experiences],' he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Of course, the patients died, so we have no confirmation that such experiences occurred.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers proposed two possible explanations for what they saw in the EEG data. The first was electrical interference could have affected the sensors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, since the activity was observed on two monitoring devices that used different methods to transcribe the brain activity, interference seemed unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other theory was that the burst of activity was actually when the brain ran out of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'As the brain reaches a critical level of hypoxia, the [an electrical signal that travels down a neuron]&lt;/span&gt; is lost by large numbers of neurons, and this loss of electrical potential causes a cascade of electrical activity,' they shared in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers speculated that this is why patients who suffer cardiac arrest and are successfully revived, they may recall the images and memories triggered by this cascade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We offer this as a potential explanation for the clarity in which many patients have 'out of body experiences' when successfully revived from a near-death event,' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'In our critical care practice, we spend a significant amount of time with grieving families. In these interactions, we have found that the idea that 'something' happens at the time of death is comforting to the families.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:26:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOSTQtbjVMUmM4aktDXzZqV2c5Q2JUS1RLVTNYMU9JLVZjdlVuU1RyQzZxY3VSLUpiOVNwcUcxLTVYVlZySHJHbGV4dGxzVFJpUTNOdWN5TmVpcEI5YVpHRzd3UzhLMVcxcUw1a2gxUFEtVGdKU3ZqenZhcG41U0x4b1VWOGtIMnBLbWhWLTg5eS1xaWJrakktLTdFVVgzUW9xODJ2X1BIcW9ZcVpLdVF5dTZQWmNqR3NYYnRRWW1wMkE</guid></item><item><title>Texas measles cases are up, and New Mexico now has an outbreak.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Zhentao Zhang at Wuhan University, China have discovered a cholesterol metabolite that plays a critical role in the development of Parkinson's disease in mice. Published in the journal &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://plos.io/4gujU08" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; shows that this metabolite is responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the death of dopaminergic neurons in the brain—the two major hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Blocking its activity or preventing it from being made by the body could therefore be effective strategies for treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease develops when the protein alpha-Syn forms clumps of tiny pathological fibers in the brain called Lewy bodies, which spread from brain cell to brain cell, and eventually trigger the death of dopamine neurons. The new study focuses on what causes the spread of pathological alpha-Syn, with the authors hypothesizing that the culprit is 24-OHC, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cholesterol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; metabolite known to present at high levels in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, and to increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After confirming that 24-OHC levels were higher in the blood of patients with Parkinson's disease as well as in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mouse+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mouse model&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, the researchers blocked its production in the mouse model by knocking out the enzyme that creates it from cholesterol. This reduced both the spread of the harmful alpha-Syn fibers and the damage to the dopamine neurons in the critical part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments with neurons cultured in a dish showed that the addition of 24-OHC caused normal alpha-Syn to change into harmful alpha-Syn fibers. Injecting mice with these fibers led to greater spread of Lewy bodies, more dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and greater motor deficits than did injecting them with alpha-Syn fibers formed in the absence of 24-OHC. Drugs that prevent cholesterol from being converted to 24-OHC might therefore be an effective treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors state, "Our findings indicate that the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase CYP46A1 plays a pivotal role in the progression of α-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Researchers estimated that 42% of Americans over age 55 will eventually develop dementia. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Aging of the U.S. population is expected to cause the number of new dementia cases per year to double by 2060.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent dementia and provide more help for those with dementia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects more than 6 million Americans and accounts for more than 100,000 deaths each year. Knowing people’s lifetime risk of dementia can lead to improved prevention efforts. It can also inform public health planning by generating projections of future cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous estimates of lifetime dementia risk in the United States are 11-14% for men and 19-23% for women. But these are based on older data in which dementia wasn’t reliably documented and early-stage cases were often missed. These data were also typically limited to non-Hispanic White populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Drs. Josef Coresh at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and Michael Fang at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health generated updated estimates of lifetime dementia risk across different subsets of the population. They also projected the number of people who would be newly diagnosed with dementia in the U.S. between 2020 and 2060. Results appeared in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on January 13, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed data on more than 15,000 people from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. All the people studied were free of dementia at age 55. More than a quarter were Black, and more than half were women. About 31% had at least one copy of the apolipoprotein E4 (&lt;em&gt;APOEε4&lt;/em&gt;) gene variant, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team primarily relied on in-person evaluations. For participants who didn’t come in person, they used phone-based cognitive assessments. They also examined hospital records and death certificates for dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers estimated a lifetime risk of dementia of 42% after age 55, more than double previous estimates. The dementia risk was 4% by age 75 and 20% by age 85, with the majority of the risk occurring after 85. Certain groups had greater risks than others. For example, women had a higher lifetime risk due to survival to older ages, 48% versus 35% in men. People with two &lt;em&gt;APOEε4&lt;/em&gt; copies had a lifetime risk of almost 60%, versus 48% for those with one copy and 39% for those with none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team applied their lifetime risk estimates to future population projections from the U.S. Census. They projected that the number of new dementia cases in the U.S. will double over the next four decades, from about 514,000 in 2020 to about 1 million in 2060.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that the lifetime risk of dementia may be much higher than previously thought. This highlights an urgent need for policies that promote healthy aging. Interventions targeted toward high-risk individuals could help reduce the societal burdens of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The pending population boom in dementia cases poses significant challenges for health policymakers, in particular, who must refocus their efforts on strategies to minimize dementia risk and the severity of dementia cases, as well as plans to provide more health care services for those with dementia,” Coresh says.&lt;/p&gt;

"Ultra-processed food is driving the obesity epidemic. When we get President Trump back in the White House and me to Washington, we're going to fix our broken food system and Make America Healthy Again,” he said in an earlier X post. He has also pledged to remove ultra-processed foods from school lunches due to their potential link to cancer in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, diabetes, obesity, sleep problems, and even premature death, according to multiple researchers. So, it's certain that they have to go from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the MAHA movement is leading efforts to reform the nation’s food system, here are some changes you can make in your homes.

As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="How-bird-flu-spreads" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;How bird flu spreads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that’s the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/media/pdfs/2024/07/avian-flu-transmission.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/media/pdfs/2024/07/avian-flu-transmission.pdf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC emphasizes that “no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Spotting-a-sick-flock" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Spotting a sick flock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank" title="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Protecting-yourself-if-you-have-chickens" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Protecting yourself if you have chickens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/caring/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/caring/index.html"&gt;guide for backyard flock owners&lt;/a&gt; offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wear PPE around sick or dead birds. Ideal PPE includes safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t touch your PPE until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never wear used PPE in your home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When cleaning and disinfecting, don’t stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you’re done, toss the PPE or clean it properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Cats-and-dogs-at-risk" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Cats and dogs at risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 18:29:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZGlvX2E0cm9tNWNsUTc4UUVxOWVhZjVpNnUyRHQxR1BIemdjY1UxMHEtSlBMdTlEWGR6OWNWaVVlanNoSWYtQnFoMWR5VXNRYzQzaVQzNkpVaTBxazA4VzgxZF9xVUNwejd2c29teUJwdEJkcTI2QXFWcVJoencxSDdxeFZSTWEtR0tuV3dvM2tsQmFJOVZEZTh0NlE</guid></item><item><title>West Texas measles outbreak grows to 58 cases, including some vaccinated individuals - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFA0Q0NWM29YZl94QmpnVWdZQ0sybF9iQ21GbG9BYXFtUFZTWmdvQThTWk1kcHFhWEJSeDRMOWpHb01qQk9jM2drOHh5NWF6NC1KSklOWmZrSDM0a0ZlLUxDNG5jR3g5aWpqQUxkeUhEWi00V1JVZWV0S0w1QdIBckFVX3lxTE1lOXg0bHpBLV94cDBPVTFpMm91LVNTNTZPbXVoM21LMEd4d0VHQ1lZcEJvNUFIY3puRjA5TGZ6Q0xEU2RqWVF5YmF2SmU1WGdXVTBCRTZibTJxTkZSeXoyV2RNT3k1VVZUTkpnSTNxRXEwdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The number of measles cases linked to an outbreak in West Texas has grown to 58 cases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-18-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00023b5vuw8a4z2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases are centered in Gaines County, which is reporting 45 cases. Other surrounding areas are seeing spread of the illness too, with 9 cases in Terry County, 2 in Yoakum County, 1 in Lynn County and 1 in Lubbock County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00033b5v2axhbe7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cases are mostly in children ages 5 to 17 years old. While most cases are in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown status, there were 4 cases of measles in people who were vaccinated. CNN is working to obtain more information regarding the vaccinated cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar6xjq00003b5vat7dt6n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All experienced an onset of symptoms in the past three weeks. Among the 58 cases, 13 have been hospitalized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Local health departments in West Texas are hosting free vaccination clinics for the community. There have been at least 95 measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations at the clinic hosted by South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, according to Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director. The clinic recently expanded its hours to be open seven days a week for vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00053b5v4dz7p1yy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given how contagious measles is, health officials warn that cases may continue to rise in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00063b5vlho3wu0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an airborne illness that can cause rash, fever, red eyes and cough. Severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain. In some cases, the illness can be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00073b5vjcr3ea8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7aratks000m3b5vsro9f2by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other affected Texas counties also fall below the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the MMR vaccine, a threshold set by the US Department of Health and Human Services to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. Lynn, Lubbock, and Yoakum counties all stand around 92%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm00093b5vsuvfxf3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm000a3b5vrejuqrkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three cases of measles have been detected in a bordering county in New Mexico, officials said on Friday. While connection to the Texas outbreak is “suspected,” investigation is ongoing, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ar7cmm000b3b5vday90awh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 285 measles cases reported in the US last year, the most since 2019, according to the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2016%20outbreaks,59)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; This year, cases have been identified in Texas, Alaska, New Mexico, Georgia, Rhode Island and New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Seed oil naysayers claim these plant-based cooking oils are "toxic" or lead to chronic diseases, neither of which are backed by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many critics promote swapping seed oils for animal fats like butter, beef tallow and lard. Just two decades after the fat-free era of the early 2000s, people are now fighting about which fat is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While it's true that not all fats or oils are equal, the recent discourse has left many confused. So, which is better for you — seed oils, or animal fats?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are seed oils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils are a type of vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of plants, Dr. Nate Wood, director of culinary medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Popular seed oils include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canola oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soybean oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunflower oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corn oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safflower oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sesame oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottonseed oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grapeseed oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All seed oils are vegetable oils, but not all vegetable oils are seed oils. Other vegetable oils may be extracted from the fruit or pulp of the plant, such as olive, avocado and coconut oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Seeds are a high-fat food ... so we take the seeds and extract all the fat out of them and leave behind the fiber and the protein,” Wood says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These seeds go through multiple processes to become cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;First, the seeds are usually pressed, which extracts the oil by crushing the seeds, Lena Beal, cardiovascular dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oil may also go through chemical extraction, which uses solvents to separate the oil from the seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After extraction, most seed oils are refined to remove particles, improve the taste and shelf-life, and make the oil more heat-stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Are seed oils healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils are healthy when consumed in moderation as part of a healthy, balanced diet, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Seed oils are largely unsaturated fats, which we know are really healthy," says Wood. These include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, which are "good" fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The goal is to consume more good fats and fewer “bad” or unhealthy fats (saturated and trans fats), per &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/healthy-cooking-oils" target="_blank"&gt;the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unsaturated fats can lower LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, and boost HDL, or "good" cholesterol. “They’re really good at protecting against heart disease,” says Wood. &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-cooking-oils-rcna145850" target="_blank"&gt;Unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; in these oils can also lower the risk of stroke, support brain function and improve blood sugar levels, TODAY.com previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils are generally higher in polyunsaturated fats, which provide essential omega fatty acids that our body can't produce on its own. "Most seed oils have a good amount of omega-6, and smaller amounts of omega-3," says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unrefined seed oils contain more nutrients than highly refined seed oils, but both can be part of a healthy diet, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why are seed oils controversial?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils get a bad rap for a few reasons, says Wood. Many critics believe seed oils are harmful because they have a high omega-6 content and they’re found in ultraprocessed foods. Some people also say the refining process makes seed oils "toxic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nutritional science can be confusing, but any claims that seed oil is poisonous are “scientifically wrong,” Gardner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Omega-6s in seed oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils contain high levels of omega-6 unsaturated fatty acids, which are controversial because some are linked to inflammation, particularly when a person doesn't get enough anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cooking-oil-cancer-rcna183982" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While it's true that our body uses some omega-6s as precursors to create inflammatory molecules, this can be a good thing, says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Part of what (omega-6s) do is they help the immune system work on an inflammatory response," Christopher Gardner, Ph.D., professor of Medicine at Stanford University, tells TODAY.com. This is how the body attacks germs, fights infections and heals injuries, Wood adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Omega-6s play a smaller role than omega-3s in protecting heart health, but they can still lower LDL — which is why the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.108.191627" target="_blank"&gt;AHA supports&lt;/a&gt; including seed oils as part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have decades of evidence on how those &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908" target="_blank"&gt;omega-6 fatty acids are heart-healthy&lt;/a&gt; when you replace the saturated fats in your diet,” says Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, it's important to get a balanced ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s, which are found mostly in fish and nuts, says Wood. The American diet is very high in omega-6s. “The reason isn’t because we’re cooking with canola oil. It’s because we’re eating lots of ultra-processed foods,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Seed oils in processed foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;We know &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/ultraprocessed-food-health-risk-study-rcna141112" target="_blank"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, aka junk foods, are bad for us, says Wood. Research shows they're linked to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" target="_blank"&gt;poor health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; and mortality. “Ultraprocessed foods also have lots of seed oils in them," says Wood. People conflate these two ideas and blame seed oils, says Gardner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re attributing the adverse health consequences to the seed oils, when, in fact, it’s the junk food as a whole. It’s the sugar, the salt, the added ingredients," says Gardner. Ultraprocessed foods often contain refined carbohydrates and little to no nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Replacing the seed oils in ultraprocessed foods with lard and beef tallow would make them even worse, Gardner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;The refining process of seed oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another claim is that “industrial seed oils,” as many critics call them, are “toxic” because they are highly processed. "It’s the idea that we take a seed, a natural thing, then we hyper-process it into (oil) and through that process, it becomes something that’s not good for our health,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, the experts say. “They’re not poison,” Wood adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The refining process can remove some nutrients, but it also makes the oil more heat-stable and less prone to oxidization, which can release harmful free radicals, or unstable molecules that may increase the risk of cancer, says Beal. Other vegetable oils also go through refining, as do some animal fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re concerned about processing, the experts recommend first cutting out ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are animal fats?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Animal fats are lipids derived from animals, including beef, pork and poultry. Common animal fats include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beef tallow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duck fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These fats are often rendered, which involves cooking the fat until it liquifies and can be separated from the meat. Animal fats may be refined to remove impurities and improve the smell or color, &lt;a href="https://www.aocs.org/resource/animal-fats/" target="_blank"&gt;per the American Oil Chemists' Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Butter is made by agitating milk cream to separate the liquid. Ghee, a staple in Indian cuisine, is butter that's been clarified by cooking it to remove all the milk solids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Animal fats are largely saturated fat, the experts note. “These are typically solid at room temperature,” says Beal. Some animal fats contain a small amount of monounsaturated fats, Beal adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Are animal fats healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Animal fats, such as butter or tallow, aren't exactly superfoods, but they may be healthy when eaten in moderation occasionally, as part of a healthy diet, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The main issue is their high saturated fat content, which can raise "bad" LDL cholesterol. "Saturated fats are not beneficial in any way," says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, animal fats do have some positive qualities. They're a good source of energy and rich in nutrients, such as fat-soluble vitamins, says Beal. These include vitamins A, D and E. "They also have stearic acid, which is beneficial," Beal adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Animal fats tend to be more stable and add more flavor when cooking. “There’s a cultural element ... and it's a way to reduce food waste,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, many nutrition experts say the risks of regularly eating animal fats outweigh the benefits. “The more saturated fat you eat, the more bad cholesterol you have in your blood, and that’s what leads to plaque, heart disease and strokes,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2821738" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; that followed over 407,000 people for 24 years found that a diet high in animal fat was associated with a higher risk of dying from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We can eat &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; saturated fat, but when I say some, I mean a small amount," says Beal. The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" target="_blank"&gt;AHA recommends&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of your total calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Is seed oil or animal fat healthier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Seed oils are generally considered healthier than animal fats due to their high unsaturated fat content, which is linked to a number of benefits backed by research, according to the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is a lot of evidence for the benefits of getting rid of saturated replacing it with polyunsaturated fats,” says Gardner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Population studies show people who replace animal-based fats, such as butter or tallow, with seed oils tend to have a lower LDL cholesterol and lower rates of heart disease, Gardner says. "Your overall risk of mortality also goes down," Wood adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, it's important to consider how you use the oil. The smoke point, or the temperature at which oil burns, is a big factor, says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The omega-6 fatty acids in seed oils can degrade and oxidize when heated to high temperatures, says Beal. “Oxidized fat is not good for you,” Wood adds. Burned oil should be tossed, and oils should never be re-used, the experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Animal fat does not oxidize as rapidly at its smoke point as vegetable oils, but it can still burn and become rancid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Moderation is also key, says Beal. The serving size of oil is small, just one tablespoon. “Cook with it, don’t drink it," Gardner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although there's no clear evidence to support using animal fat instead of seed oil, you don't have to avoid animal fat entirely. "If you have a healthy diet full of nutritious foods and eat a little butter, you'll be fine," says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Animal fat tastes really good, but I’m not trying to convince myself that it’s good for me,” Wood adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What is the healthiest oil to cook with?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil are the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-cooking-oils-rcna145850" target="_blank"&gt;healthiest cooking oils,&lt;/a&gt; the experts say. These are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which help boost good cholesterol, and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unrefined oil is better, says Beal, but has a lower smoke point. The experts suggest using different cooking oils for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re frying or grilling, I’d say avocado or refined olive oil. For sautéing or baking, extra virgin olive oil. Then for salads or drizzling, I’d also use EVOO or another unrefined oil, like sunflower," says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the healthiest animal fat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you're going to cook with animal fat, Beal recommends opting for minimally processed fats from grass-fed, pasture-raised animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Grass-fed butter, for example, comes from cows that only eat grass, which leads to higher levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-butter-rcna160986" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Whether you use seed oils, animal fats or a combination, it’s important to have a balanced diet full of nutrient-dense, whole foods. “What you’re cooking with the oil is just as important,” says Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:44:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQbFpPMDhUaXZVdlV1OVBxc2pMQmo4TnBXUjdFaEUwU0NNdmNJbDRwV0l4R05hdmNpMWVjVkNLN2lfa0ZTelpULXV6RTFGbVlUT3YwcUVHM1M0NEFpQVBtR1d4d3IwX05xQ1Z0R1dXMTNET0kwb3hjSjJqMkEwNnFhdNIBVEFVX3lxTE1UaW01bklhWlJjcDRvQjZUaGF4Yjd3WjAtTEVWRUpzWVBQWnlkSHc3SlB5Z1ZITlJWTElTTXVjaUxhN2d6V0oteG04Qzk0R0M4UmtDTA</guid></item><item><title>Measles Is Rampaging Through Rural Texas: Dozens Sick, Hundreds Feared Infected - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQanVTQVE3ZFZwYXFrUXgtSDZiZkdudEdCMWlKeFZQQldaOElPUDlZVm9sS1dFSHNYVkZteXdBWlNjR0Nzeng5akhKTEFteXFDd2IxelFLUnB3XzlOWTA4OFkzalF0Wll3eDlnV25BU05Zb3RMd3BqcFVza3UtRGJ5cTcyT2otVWlGdTBxZjctNXQ5NjFNZnlCOWcwOF9LNVlFSEg5M25hVEdiTHhZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles is currently raging in Texas. Health officials have documented dozens of cases over the past month, but the true tally may be substantially higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-14-2025"&gt;provided&lt;/a&gt; the latest update on the measles outbreak, which has been ongoing since at least mid-January. Within the last three weeks, there have been 48 cases reported in the rural South Plains region of Western Texas, mostly involving children and teenagers. The outbreak hasn’t shown signs of slowing down yet, though, and officials worry that hundreds of kids have actually been infected so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that typically strikes young children. Its most common symptoms are fever, a distinctive rash, cough, and watery eyes. Recent research has &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-10-31/measles-infection-causes-immune-amnesia-leaving-kids-vulnerable-to-other-illnesses"&gt;also indicated&lt;/a&gt; that a measles infection can wipe away a person’s immunity to other germs, making them vulnerable once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people survive their bout with measles, but it can be more life-threatening in younger children. And though measles vaccination is highly effective at preventing infection, the virus continues to thrive in parts of the world where vaccine uptake is low. As of late, measles cases have surged. According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 10 million cases of measles worldwide in 2023, up 20% from the previous year, along with over 100,000 deaths that year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., measles has been locally eliminated for over two decades. But the virus can still spark outbreaks in communities, particularly in places with vaccination rates below the herd immunity threshold; because the virus is so highly contagious, it takes about 94% of a population being vaccinated to keep measles from spreading far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, at least 13 people have been hospitalized in this latest outbreak. But officials expect more cases to be identified, and it’s possible that between 200 to 300 people in total have already been infected. All known cases involve unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status, according to the DSHS. The bulk of the cases are in a rural Mennonite community, though officials note that the lower vaccination rate isn’t due to an explicit religious objection from its leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The church isn’t the reason that they’re not vaccinated,” Texas DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press Friday. “It’s all personal choice and you can do whatever you want. It’s just that the community doesn’t go and get regular health care.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overall rate of measles vaccination remains high in the U.S., though it’s slightly dipped in recent years. As of the 2022/2023 school year, roughly 93% of school-age children &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm#:~:text=Introduction,the%202023%E2%80%9324%20school%20year."&gt;have gotten&lt;/a&gt; their measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. But the anti-vaccination movement has contributed to declining public trust in &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/survey-reveals-growing-american-distrust-vaccines-covid-other-infectious-diseases"&gt;at least some vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. And things aren’t expected to get any better with the arrival of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-official-rfk-jr-is-now-in-charge-of-americas-public-health-2000563537"&gt;the incoming director&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency that oversees the country’s public health. Kennedy and other prominent anti-vaxxers have routinely made false and misleading statements about the safety of vaccines, often based on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/"&gt;poorly done, misrepresented, or fraudulent data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s possible then that this outbreak in Texas will only be a preview of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

According to psychiatrists in India, a 25-year-old female developed a sudden onset of intense sexual desire and compulsive masturbation after her dose of escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was increased. This unexpected effect completely resolved when the medication was discontinued, suggesting a clear link between the drug and this rare side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, often referred to as SSRIs, are a class of medications widely used as a first-line treatment for various mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These medications work by influencing the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a naturally occurring chemical messenger that plays a significant role in regulating mood, emotions, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs function by blocking the reabsorption, or “reuptake,” of serotonin in the brain. This action increases the amount of serotonin available in the space between brain cells, known as the synapse, allowing it to have a greater effect. By increasing serotonin levels, SSRIs can help to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety for many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report details the experience of a 25-year-old married woman who sought psychiatric help due to symptoms of low mood, persistent fatigue, frequent outbursts of anger over minor issues, and suicidal thoughts that had been present for approximately six months. She reported a lack of interest in caring for her children and performing routine household tasks. These symptoms began after she discovered that her husband was having an affair. This revelation led to frequent arguments with her husband, and she experienced constant, intrusive thoughts and worries about the strained relationship, resulting in reduced sleep and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on her symptoms, she was diagnosed with severe depression without psychotic features. Her treatment began with escitalopram, starting at a dose of five milligrams per day. Within a week, the dosage was increased to ten milligrams per day. She tolerated the medication well and showed signs of improvement in her depressive symptoms. However, she did not experience a complete resolution of her symptoms, and after two months, her psychiatrist decided to increase the dose of escitalopram further to 15 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within just five days of this dose increase, she began to experience a significant and distressing change in her sexual desire and behavior. She reported a sudden and intense increase in her sexual drive and became preoccupied with sexual thoughts. She described an overwhelming urge to masturbate throughout the day to relieve her sexual desire, and she actively sought opportunities to be alone for this purpose. She reported having sexual fantasies about engaging in sexual acts with random people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing conflict with her husband, she became insistent on having sexual intercourse with him and began behaving in a sexually suggestive manner towards him, which was a significant departure from her usual behavior. This sudden shift in her attitude and behavior caused her considerable distress. She also experienced restlessness and agitation, and despite the change in her sexual behavior, she continued to have episodes of crying and persistent suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors considered the possibility that she might be experiencing a manic switch, a shift to the opposite pole of mood, sometimes triggered by antidepressants in individuals with bipolar disorder. However, she denied experiencing any elevated mood, increased energy, changes in her personal appearance, or feelings of grandiosity, which are typical symptoms of mania. Furthermore, her symptoms did not fit the criteria for a diagnosis of sexual obsession. Her medical history was reviewed for any prior medication use or substance use, but nothing significant was found. She denied experiencing similar symptoms in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine blood tests, including a complete blood count and thyroid function tests, came back within the normal range. Considering the possibility that her symptoms were an adverse reaction to escitalopram, doctors used the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction scale, a tool to assess the likelihood that a drug caused a specific adverse effect. She scored an eight on this scale, indicating a “probable” drug-induced reaction linked to escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, escitalopram was stopped. To manage her depression, she was started on mirtazapine, another type of antidepressant. Due to the intensity of her anxiety, a low dose of risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, was added as an adjunct treatment. She was also prescribed an oral benzodiazepine to help reduce her anxiety in the short term. In addition to medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of psychotherapy, was initiated. Within two to three weeks of these changes, she showed noticeable improvement in her symptoms, including both her depression and the hypersexual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case highlights a less common but potentially distressing side effect of SSRIs: hypersexuality, or increased sexual desire and activity. While sexual dysfunction, more commonly in the form of decreased sexual desire and difficulty achieving orgasm, is a well-known side effect of SSRIs, hypersexuality is reported much less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known that sexual dysfunction related to SSRIs can be dose-dependent, meaning it may become more pronounced at higher doses. This case appears to support this idea, as the woman only developed hypersexual symptoms after her escitalopram dose was increased to 15 milligrams per day. There is a previous case report of a 40-year-old man who experienced sexual overstimulation with escitalopram, developing spontaneous erections and ejaculation at a dose of only 10 milligrams per day. In that case, switching to a different SSRI, citalopram, resulted in decreased sexual desire and delayed ejaculation, illustrating that even drugs within the same class can have varying effects on sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that case reports such as this one describe the experiences of a single individual or a small number of individuals. Therefore, they cannot establish cause and effect definitively in the same way that larger, controlled studies can. It is possible that other factors unique to this woman contributed to the development of hypersexuality. Furthermore, case reports may highlight unusual or rare occurrences, and the findings may not be generalizable to the wider population of individuals taking escitalopram. It is not possible to determine from a single case report how common this side effect might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, case reports are still a valuable tool in medicine. They serve as an early warning system, bringing attention to unusual or unexpected drug reactions that might not be detected in initial clinical trials, which often focus on more common side effects and overall drug efficacy. Case reports can also generate hypotheses for future research and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the range of effects, both intended and unintended, that medications can have. This particular case serves as a reminder for both clinicians and patients to be aware of the potential for unexpected sexual side effects from SSRIs, even those that are less commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/26318318241306280"&gt;Escitalopram-induced Hypersexuality—Imbalance of the Sexual Seesaw&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Souganyadevi Mahalakshmi, Barath Ramanathan, Arun Selvaraj, Perarul Sivakumar, and Priyanka Ponnusamy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:07:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxONXlTUDk5Z2lOY3A1VGlURlBSMU9iVFdJdHRLRHlEM0R6WFRoTHZtV2hucld1azMtaFFGVUhIb2h1WWxKV0hCUUxRQkM1OFRST0pfWG1SOUxwaHN5WVVyRnl5czhYR3BlNHZIQkRBN19MdnNlMzVTU29YaG12dWl1N2Rsa3gxN3B5eXVTaVZ0ZVg1UDg</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu cases confirmed in Henderson County waterfowl - WSPA 7News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQcnFOOHI2MWZoSFBEdGtIWU1meHluZFRxQkNBdFF5RTB5NENDZ1NMSzlBYU9oaUpBaVlRbk96OVlFcHlYMHNpbkJUNDNwNE1iVWZhLXQxeUhUTmVXWW9hWk1HcG5oaExHakI1cGJFSHhyVjMyMDMyUHVBbXh0TUtpVmV2SlI2SnAzcXprT1hUVkswLVpQUG1F0gGcAUFVX3lxTE1kQjRUN3VHaVhoM2xvRWdrdUFvaElXNnpDTDlXNndNQ1M3S2xMQzJXQzZSLWFVbjViYUpsOWprY2piRjVHZzZybWFWVkh6VzdVOG53Yms5SnNZLW9OdW1OYzBHOFhEbjJYbEJxTUFpcWtMLXFCVFl1SjNVZG84Tk9WNnVwbUxBdWVTZ3BHTVY0a3B6WlpmRDRxM0Y3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

How do we have to modify operations to be able to still see patients?” Colon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="13"&gt;When hospitals are busier, there are longer wait times, Colon said, which is why hospitals want to ensure that patients do not rush into some of those acute facilities for mild symptoms or for diagnosis only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="16"&gt;“The majority of influenza cases do not require hospitalization, do not require patients to be seen in the emergency department,” Colon said. “Most of this is going to be managed with outpatient care, fluids, Tamiflu to be able to help reduce the severity of symptoms and help people recover faster.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;GDAHA is asking people to keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="list b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emergency transportation:&lt;/b&gt; You may be given the option to be transported to a nearby hospital that is less busy. Be prepared with your alternative if given the option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longer wait times: &lt;/b&gt;You may experience longer wait times in the emergency department as staff prioritize care for the most critical patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alternative care for non-emergencies:&lt;/b&gt; If you are experiencing mild symptoms such as congestion, cough, or low-grade fever, GDAHA suggests people consider visiting your primary care physician or an urgent care center (in-person or virtual).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urgent care center:&lt;/b&gt; Walk-in clinics provide care for non-emergency illness or injury for those who are unable to see their doctor or do not have a primary care physician. Urgent care centers can treat non-emergency medical conditions such as sprains and strains, sinus and ear infections, and minor cuts and burns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emergency care needs: &lt;/b&gt;If you are experiencing severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, dehydration or a fever above 104°F, please seek immediate emergency care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;At-home testing:&lt;/b&gt; Over-the-counter tests that test for both flu and COVID-19 are available at your local pharmacy for purchase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;As with any flu or respiratory illness, wash your hands frequently and cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough in order to protect yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;It’s still not too late for a flu vaccination. GDAHA is encouraging all community members to get their flu shot, which is available at your local pharmacy through March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;The flu vaccine may not prevent you from getting sick, but it helps protect against the worst symptoms, doctors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;“That’s really where the benefit lies is in preventing a lot of those severe manifestations for people who are vaccinated,” Colon said. “That’s why we advocate so much for those individuals who are at the highest risk for complications to absolutely get vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dayton Daily News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:24:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxQVl9tX2c5UmdSMkdYT2RhZFIyTFdqNG9mM0JDQkR1dGdFakk2OWFxZEh6Z0J3eGt3S1hMeWZmeVpmMloxN010QXEyQW5yUy1iZWxObmNtS1BRUlZ1Q29pVUNxd1FuSHZUcmZpdEdpRVRhYTRvZEpyRmotejNGcEpaRzRyQjZmYW05bUYycTJXVGJ5blVDNVhEWVlvLWFGM0prTHJrcFBzSnk2cGhfcTZQYUVBVzV4VEI2b2ZSSmVSTVVHdC14ckE</guid></item><item><title>Infectious Updates 2-18-2025 - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOTjNMbmJRVTl1MnFZd3BQQjZNNTFfMDlmeW9obThRbW13cXVNNTlvRWlMb2FxeWlhZ25FZVk2bTdtZUlHT3otNUlib1MyM2NOdEtlMUlWNUk3U3hvRXdjVlRFTGNON2JMRmVTOGl5TWY5NldKZHdya0dDdVZtcTRqZU9zX21lWHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Update:  oh joy.  The head of the FDA food safety division has just resigned. No replacement immediately evident.  Jim Jones had been with the FDA only since 2023, he was previously with the EPA for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was looking forward to working to pursue the Department's agenda of improving the health of Americans by reducing diet-related chronic disease and risks from chemicals in food," Jones said. "It has been increasingly clear that with the Trump Administration's disdain for the very people necessary to implement your agenda, however, it would have been fruitless for me to continue in this role."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A third independent spillover&lt;/u&gt; of avian flu to dairy cows has occurred in Arizona. This is also the D1.1 subtype, but sequencing shows it was not spread from the Nevada herds. The cattle were not showing symptoms when they tested positive. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/third-avian-flu-spillover-reported-arizona-dairy-herd-raw-pet-food-sickens" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Wyoming woman is hospitalized&lt;/u&gt; in Colorado with bird flu, caught from her backyard flock. She is older and has underlying medical conditions.  She is the fourth person to be hospitalized with bird flu in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/quick-takes-new-mexico-measles-outbreak-fda-clears-chikungunya-meningococcal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cats in two Oregon households&lt;/u&gt; were sickened by raw pet food.  They had to be euthanized due to the severity of their illness.  Unopened containers were tested and matched the samples from the cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings prompted a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/lookuptypes/recallfile/131" target="_blank"&gt;consumer alert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from the Washington State Department of Agriculture about the risk of avian flu in certain lots of pet food made by Wild Coast Raw, based in Olympia, Washington. The alert applies to two lots of feline formula boneless free-range chicken formula sold in 24-ounce plastic containers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lea County, New Mexico&lt;/u&gt; now has three measles cases in adults.  They are suspected but not confirmed to be linked to the Texas cases just across the border. There is one case in New Jersey, in someone who just returned from international travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freeze in US aid is upending tuberculosis treatments around the world and could result in more drug-resistant TB strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study finds that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-study-reveals-a-major-link-between-vaccines-and-alzheimers/" target="_blank"&gt;Certain vaccines reduce the risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maxwell Azzarello doused himself in an alcohol substance before self-immolating near a Manhattan criminal court last year (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being burned alive typically causes death in just a few minutes. However, those few minutes are torturous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fire causes soft tissues to contract, which leads to skin tearing off in layers, starting with the outermost layer, the epidermis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In just seconds, fire can strip the body of its deepest skin later, the hypodermis. This is composed of fat cells and connective tissue that protect organs from trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once all the skin burns off, fire burns muscles and fat, causing them to shrink. With nothing left to protect the organs, they can either boil or start to decompose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eyes may also boil, causing blindness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, however, people being burned alive typically die from smoke inhalation. In fact, smoke inhalation is responsible for about eight in 10 fire-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The smoke cuts off the body's oxygen supply, leading to difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fire victim may also inhale chemicals from the smoke like carbon monoxide, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, severe pain, and convulsions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is shown sitting on a subway bench watching as the woman he set fire to burns alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While death by fire is often associated with the witch trials and historical figures like Joan of Arc, there have been several recent examples as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, 37-year-old &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13329109/Man-sets-FIRE-outside-Trump-trial.html"&gt;Maxwell Azzarello&lt;/a&gt; doused himself in alcohol and set himself on fire outside of the Manhattan courthouse where President Donald Trump faced criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months prior, Air Force airman &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13126103/aaron-bushnell-air-force-set-fire-israel-embassy-transition-military.html"&gt;Aaron Bushnell&lt;/a&gt;, 25, self-immolated as an 'extreme act of protest' against the Israel-Gaza war.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in December, Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, a 33-year-old migrant from Guatemala, set &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14221651/subway-fire-migrant-killer-nyc.html"&gt;Debrina Kawam&lt;/a&gt; on fire while she road the subway. She died within minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 5,000 Americans die from fire every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Radiation poisoning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hisashi Ouchi, 35, experienced unimaginable suffering in an 83-day ordeal after being exposed to a record-breaking amount of radiation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In small doses, radiation can be used to target and treat conditions like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-fadc82e0-ed40-11ef-82a0-1ba4c644e4df"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by killing off harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in extreme and rare cases, high doses of radiation can burn the body from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was seen in the case of Hisashi Ouchi, a 35-year-old worker at a nuclear fuel processing plant in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1999, Ouchi and two of his colleagues were standing at a fuel tank when one of them added 35 pounds of uranium into a processor — seven times higher than the safe limit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team recalled a sudden flash of blue light before being hit with an explosion of radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi, who was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-12299235/How-worlds-radioactive-man-cried-blood-kept-alive-83-day-nightmare.html"&gt;stood over the processing container at the time&lt;/a&gt;, was exposed to 17,000 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation, the most recorded by any person at a single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the safety limit for those working around radiation is 20 mSv per year, with 5,000 mSv considered a fatal dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dubbed the most 'radioactive man' in history, Ouchi's ordeal started one fateful day at his workplace, a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though he seemed healthy at first, Ouchi deteriorated over 83 days as the extreme radiation exposure killed off his cells faster than his body could replace them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His skin began falling off in layers to the point where he leaked gallons of bodily fluids through exposed flesh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi's lungs rapidly filled up with fluid due to his lung tissue becoming damaged, allowing fluid to leak out of the lungs' air sacs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The radiation also killed cells in his digestive system that would otherwise help him absorb food and medication. This caused him to excrete nearly a gallon of diarrhea every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi also needed 10 blood transfusions per day due to internal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the radiation damaged the lacrimal glands in his eyes, which produce tears. This caused his eyes to become so dry that his eyelids fell off and he began 'crying blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi died of multi-organ failure 83 days after his accident.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 50 Americans have died from radiation sickness since World War II, and the majority of these were workers and firefighters during the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Getting eaten alive by bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above image shows scaphism, a torture technique in ancient Persia that involved a slow death by bees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though far less common today, death by bees was once a common torture method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7HWFu8RP4"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, mortician Caitlin Doughty explained that this method, called scaphism, was commonplace in ancient Persia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involved stripping a person of their clothing and placing them between two hollowed out logs with just the head and limbs sticking out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Torturers would them pour honey all over the person's body and into their eyes. They would also force the person to ingest milk and honey to cause diarrhea and repeat the process for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gruesome practice was meant to attract bees and other insects, which would lay eggs and slowly eat the body alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charmaine van Wyck, a forensic scientist in South Africa, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/worst-most-painful-ways-die-halloween-1753937"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; that ancient torture techniques like this 'were engineered to keep you alive and conscious as long as possible and as such inflict the max amount of pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear how many ancient Persians died from this technique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;LaShawn Thompson (pictured), a man who died in a bedbug-infested cell in a Georgia jail's psychiatric wing 'died due to severe neglect,' according to an independent autopsy released by lawyers for his family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much more recently, 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson was found dead in his Georgia prison cell in 2022 after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12112759/Schizophrenic-inmates-death-ruled-homicide-caused-neglect-eaten-bed-bugs.html"&gt;being eaten alive by bed bugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Michael Harper, a lawyer for Mr Thompson's family, said in a statement: 'Mr Thompson was found dead in a filthy jail cell after being eaten alive by insects and bed bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The jail cell Mr Thompson was housed in was not fit for a diseased animal. He did not deserve this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though bed bug bites are usually harmless, severe infestations can lead to anemia, as bed bugs feed on blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe anemia reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood, which prevents it from traveling to and supplying vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to multi-organ failure, particularly the heart, as it can't effectively pump blood to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though insects kill roughly 1million Americans per year, the vast majority of these are due to allergic reactions from stings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Decompression sickness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On November 5, 1983, the Byford Dolphin incident shocked the offshore drilling industry, when routine maintenance work ended with workers dying instantly. One also saw his organs fly out of his body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More casually known as 'the bends,' decompression syndrome occurs when someone transitions from a high-pressure environment to a lower pressure environment too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is most common in deep sea divers who plunge into the water with compressed air, pressurized air from a tank that lets them breathe normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Harvard University, diving with compressed air causes you to take in extra oxygen and nitrogen. The body uses the oxygen to breathe, but nitrogen dissolves into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pressure decreases closer to the surface, but if the transition happens too quickly, nitrogen doesn't have enough time to clear out of the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The excess nitrogen spreads throughout the body and to surrounding organs, damaging blood vessels and blocking blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bubbles also lead to severe muscle cramps and pain up until organs die.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An even more extreme case is explosive decompression, which occured during the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14398149/brutal-death-recorded-history-Deep-sea-divers.html"&gt;1983 Byford Dolphin oil rig disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Divers working inside a decompression chamber when an error caused it to suddenly decompress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though most workers died instantly, their deaths were grisly. Three workers had their blood to 'boil' as dissolved nitrogen returned to a gas state fat accumulated and solidified in their arteries, veins, hearts and liver and their bodies were scattered throughout the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One worker, however, was forced through a 24-inch gap with a force of 25 tons and his organs burst out of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only way to prevent decompression sickness is to cautiously return to the surface to allow time for the nitrogen to diffuse naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimate just under 600 Americans between 2006 and 2015 died from diving, though it's unclear how many were from decompression sickness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being burned alive typically causes death in just a few minutes. However, those few minutes are torturous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fire causes soft tissues to contract, which leads to skin tearing off in layers, starting with the outermost layer, the epidermis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In just seconds, fire can strip the body of its deepest skin later, the hypodermis. This is composed of fat cells and connective tissue that protect organs from trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once all the skin burns off, fire burns muscles and fat, causing them to shrink. With nothing left to protect the organs, they can either boil or start to decompose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eyes may also boil, causing blindness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, however, people being burned alive typically die from smoke inhalation. In fact, smoke inhalation is responsible for about eight in 10 fire-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The smoke cuts off the body's oxygen supply, leading to difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fire victim may also inhale chemicals from the smoke like carbon monoxide, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, severe pain, and convulsions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is shown sitting on a subway bench watching as the woman he set fire to burns alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While death by fire is often associated with the witch trials and historical figures like Joan of Arc, there have been several recent examples as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, 37-year-old &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13329109/Man-sets-FIRE-outside-Trump-trial.html"&gt;Maxwell Azzarello&lt;/a&gt; doused himself in alcohol and set himself on fire outside of the Manhattan courthouse where President Donald Trump faced criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months prior, Air Force airman &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13126103/aaron-bushnell-air-force-set-fire-israel-embassy-transition-military.html"&gt;Aaron Bushnell&lt;/a&gt;, 25, self-immolated as an 'extreme act of protest' against the Israel-Gaza war.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in December, Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, a 33-year-old migrant from Guatemala, set &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14221651/subway-fire-migrant-killer-nyc.html"&gt;Debrina Kawam&lt;/a&gt; on fire while she road the subway. She died within minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 5,000 Americans die from fire every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Radiation poisoning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hisashi Ouchi, 35, experienced unimaginable suffering in an 83-day ordeal after being exposed to a record-breaking amount of radiation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In small doses, radiation can be used to target and treat conditions like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-fadc82e0-ed40-11ef-82a0-1ba4c644e4df"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by killing off harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in extreme and rare cases, high doses of radiation can burn the body from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was seen in the case of Hisashi Ouchi, a 35-year-old worker at a nuclear fuel processing plant in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1999, Ouchi and two of his colleagues were standing at a fuel tank when one of them added 35 pounds of uranium into a processor — seven times higher than the safe limit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team recalled a sudden flash of blue light before being hit with an explosion of radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi, who was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-12299235/How-worlds-radioactive-man-cried-blood-kept-alive-83-day-nightmare.html"&gt;stood over the processing container at the time&lt;/a&gt;, was exposed to 17,000 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation, the most recorded by any person at a single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the safety limit for those working around radiation is 20 mSv per year, with 5,000 mSv considered a fatal dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dubbed the most 'radioactive man' in history, Ouchi's ordeal started one fateful day at his workplace, a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though he seemed healthy at first, Ouchi deteriorated over 83 days as the extreme radiation exposure killed off his cells faster than his body could replace them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His skin began falling off in layers to the point where he leaked gallons of bodily fluids through exposed flesh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi's lungs rapidly filled up with fluid due to his lung tissue becoming damaged, allowing fluid to leak out of the lungs' air sacs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The radiation also killed cells in his digestive system that would otherwise help him absorb food and medication. This caused him to excrete nearly a gallon of diarrhea every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi also needed 10 blood transfusions per day due to internal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the radiation damaged the lacrimal glands in his eyes, which produce tears. This caused his eyes to become so dry that his eyelids fell off and he began 'crying blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ouchi died of multi-organ failure 83 days after his accident.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 50 Americans have died from radiation sickness since World War II, and the majority of these were workers and firefighters during the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Getting eaten alive by bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above image shows scaphism, a torture technique in ancient Persia that involved a slow death by bees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though far less common today, death by bees was once a common torture method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7HWFu8RP4"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, mortician Caitlin Doughty explained that this method, called scaphism, was commonplace in ancient Persia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involved stripping a person of their clothing and placing them between two hollowed out logs with just the head and limbs sticking out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Torturers would them pour honey all over the person's body and into their eyes.

He did not deserve this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though bed bug bites are usually harmless, severe infestations can lead to anemia, as bed bugs feed on blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe anemia reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood, which prevents it from traveling to and supplying vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to multi-organ failure, particularly the heart, as it can't effectively pump blood to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though insects kill roughly 1million Americans per year, the vast majority of these are due to allergic reactions from stings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Decompression sickness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On November 5, 1983, the Byford Dolphin incident shocked the offshore drilling industry, when routine maintenance work ended with workers dying instantly.

The body uses the oxygen to breathe, but nitrogen dissolves into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pressure decreases closer to the surface, but if the transition happens too quickly, nitrogen doesn't have enough time to clear out of the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The excess nitrogen spreads throughout the body and to surrounding organs, damaging blood vessels and blocking blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bubbles also lead to severe muscle cramps and pain up until organs die.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An even more extreme case is explosive decompression, which occured during the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14398149/brutal-death-recorded-history-Deep-sea-divers.html"&gt;1983 Byford Dolphin oil rig disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Divers working inside a decompression chamber when an error caused it to suddenly decompress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though most workers died instantly, their deaths were grisly. Three workers had their blood to 'boil' as dissolved nitrogen returned to a gas state fat accumulated and solidified in their arteries, veins, hearts and liver and their bodies were scattered throughout the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One worker, however, was forced through a 24-inch gap with a force of 25 tons and his organs burst out of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only way to prevent decompression sickness is to cautiously return to the surface to allow time for the nitrogen to diffuse naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimate just under 600 Americans between 2006 and 2015 died from diving, though it's unclear how many were from decompression sickness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Alabama at Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine-led study suggests that first-time transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are associated with long-term cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Findings indicate that individuals who experienced a TIA had an annual &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; similar to those who had a stroke, despite the transient nature of the event and the absence of visible brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIA is an acute ischemic event in the brain that typically resolves within two to 15 minutes, often leaving no detectable structural damage on imaging. While stroke is well recognized as a major risk factor for cognitive impairment, the impact of TIA on long-term cognitive function has been less understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown that individuals with TIA are at a higher risk of developing dementia over five years, but whether this decline is directly caused by the TIA or due to preexisting conditions remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Cognitive Decline After First-Time Transient Ischemic Attack," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2830012" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers analyzed data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a population-based cohort tracking over 30,000 Black and White participants for cerebrovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared cognitive trajectories of individuals with first-time TIA, first-time stroke, and asymptomatic community controls. All cerebrovascular events were confirmed through neuroimaging and adjudicated by stroke specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Verbal fluency and memory were assessed biannually using standardized cognitive tests. The primary outcome was a composite cognitive score derived from four tests measuring memory and verbal function. Adjusted segmented regression models were used to compare the groups' pre-event and post-event cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cohort included 356 individuals with first-time TIA (mean age, 66.6 years), 965 individuals with first-time stroke (mean age, 66.8 years), and 14,882 asymptomatic controls (mean age, 63.2 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data showed that before any stroke or TIA occurred, participants in the stroke group already had lower cognitive test scores compared to both the TIA group and the control group. This could mean that underlying vascular issues (like &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/poor+blood+flow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;poor blood flow&lt;/a&gt; or silent mini-strokes) were already affecting cognition before they had a major stroke. After a stroke, patients showed a clear, immediate cognitive drop followed by a gradual decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIA patients did not show an immediate cognitive drop directly after their event. They did experience accelerated cognitive decline at an annual decline rate comparable to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stroke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; group and significantly greater than the control group. Cognitive decline in the TIA group was primarily driven by memory impairments rather than verbal fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that TIA, despite its transient symptoms and lack of detectable brain injury by imaging, can still have long-term consequences on cognitive health. Possible mechanisms include subtle ischemic injury, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, or interactions with underlying neurodegenerative factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to determine whether TIA contributes to dementia risk and to develop targeted post-TIA interventions to mitigate cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it is ordering food or buying groceries from a supermarket, food often arrives in plastic containers or wrapped in a plastic cling film. Despite several reports around it’s ill effects on the human body, eating from plastic containers has become the norm. A new study published in Sciencedirect suggests that eating from plastic takeout containers may increase the risk of congestive heart failure due to changes in the gut biome leading to inflammation and circulatory system damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study reveal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a two-part investigation studying over 3,000 people in China and performing experiments on rats to understand the connection between plastic food containers and heart disease. Researchers found that microplastics from food containers can leach into food and enter the gut, potentially causing damage to the gut lining. Plastic chemicals alter gut microbiota, causing inflammation that damages the circulatory system. This damage can increase intestinal permeability, allowing harmful particles to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammatory responses that may harm the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved examining the frequency of plastic takeout container use among Chinese participants and their heart disease status. Additionally, researchers exposed rats to plastic chemicals by using water boiled and poured into carryout containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the researchers wrote in their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While specific chemicals weren't identified in the study, researchers noted existing connections between common plastic compounds and heart disease, as well as previous research linking gut biome to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps to prevent use of plastic containers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize exposure to microplastics from food containers, experts recommend using glass or stainless steel containers instead of plastic ones. They also advise against heating food in plastic containers, as this can increase microplastic leaching into food. Choosing restaurants that use eco-friendly, biodegradable, or non-plastic containers is another recommended step to reduce plastic exposure from takeout food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not identify specific chemicals responsible, it builds on existing research linking BPA, phthalates, and PFAS to health risks. Public health advocates recommend avoiding microwaving plastic, using glass or stainless steel alternatives, and transferring takeout food into non-plastic containers when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Infertility history linked with increased risk of heart failure: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Lower antioxidant intake linked to increased anxiety - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPcFdteHFEMmR3Q25ZYlpjendjQUVCSGVTWGdfbTZzR0lEUk5udXp0V2Y1S0wwZGJPSFBBYjh4cWZLN2dUYTBGY1kyWENIWE9lWUNVMGNyQlB3dnRZNVhMa1BNM2JtdUJSOUVzbEZGb05weUk3bFF1elpKZTlGZlI0SVc1WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small study of adults with severe generalized anxiety disorder in Lebanon found that these individuals had a lower daily antioxidant intake. After six weeks of antioxidant supplementation, their anxiety symptoms decreased. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2024.2408972"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutritional Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="346" data-end="843"&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder is a mental health condition characterized by excessive, persistent worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, or relationships. In individuals with this disorder, anxiety is difficult to control and is accompanied by physical symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, and difficulty concentrating. Unlike situational stress, generalized anxiety disorder is chronic and can interfere with daily activities and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="845" data-end="1418"&gt;While the cause of such severe anxiety is not fully understood, studies indicate that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play an important role in various psychiatric disorders and may also contribute to generalized anxiety disorder. Oxidative stress can be counteracted by antioxidants—molecules that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that contribute to aging and diseases like cancer. Antioxidants are found in various foods, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Vitamins such as C and E also act as antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1420" data-end="1705"&gt;Study author Lucie Rizk and her colleagues sought to evaluate the relationship between daily antioxidant intake and generalized anxiety disorder. They also wanted to explore how different types of diets, combined with antioxidant supplements, might affect the severity of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1707" data-end="2119"&gt;The study had two phases. The first phase involved 155 healthy Lebanese adults between 18 and 55 years of age. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, reporting on their typical diet, as well as an anxiety assessment using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The data collected in this phase allowed the researchers to analyze the association between anxiety and dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2121" data-end="2682"&gt;The second phase of the study was an antioxidant supplement intervention. The researchers selected 40 participants with severe generalized anxiety disorder from the initial study phase and divided them into two groups. One group was assigned to take an antioxidant beverage (120 ml, containing 5.6 mmol of antioxidants) daily for six weeks, while the other group did not receive any intervention. Both groups were instructed to maintain their usual diets throughout the study period without introducing new foods or making any changes to their dietary routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2684" data-end="2941"&gt;The antioxidant-rich beverage consisted of 120 ml of water, 15 grams of green tea (containing polyphenols and tannins), 3 grams of cinnamon powder (containing cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanins), and three lemon slices (containing flavonoids and vitamin C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2943" data-end="3212"&gt;Results showed that 32% of participants in the first phase of the study had elevated anxiety symptoms. These individuals tended to be younger, had lower educational levels, and were more likely to be single compared to individuals with lower levels of anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3214" data-end="3442"&gt;There was a moderately negative association between anxiety symptom severity and antioxidant intake. In other words, individuals with more severe anxiety symptoms tended to have a lower intake of antioxidants through their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3444" data-end="3756"&gt;The second phase of the study found no significant difference in anxiety levels between the two groups at the beginning of the study. However, as the study progressed, anxiety symptoms in the group consuming the antioxidant beverage steadily decreased, while they remained relatively stable in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data highlighted the psycho-protective effects of antioxidants for GAD [generalized anxiety disorder] in Lebanese adults. However, individuals with GAD had a lower intake of antioxidants compared to the normal healthy control group. Also, our study showed that a higher intake of antioxidants could improve GAD,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="4106" data-end="4576"&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the potential effects of antioxidants on human health. However, participants were likely fully aware of the intervention they were undergoing and of the researchers’ expectations, while the key outcome was self-reported. This leaves room for the Hawthorne effect to have influenced the results. In other words, it is possible that at least some participants aligned their responses with researchers’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2024.2408972"&gt;Antioxidant intake and its relationship with generalized anxiety disorder among adults,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Lucie Rizk, Nour Abi Khalil, Rouba Karen Zeidan, Myriam Tabangi, Mehmet Akif Karaman, Roula Barake, and Sahar Nakhl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:25:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPcFdteHFEMmR3Q25ZYlpjendjQUVCSGVTWGdfbTZzR0lEUk5udXp0V2Y1S0wwZGJPSFBBYjh4cWZLN2dUYTBGY1kyWENIWE9lWUNVMGNyQlB3dnRZNVhMa1BNM2JtdUJSOUVzbEZGb05weUk3bFF1elpKZTlGZlI0SVc1WQ</guid></item><item><title>Early Life Stress Rewires Brain Circuits Linked to Social Motivation - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1VdnBiN3dPOHp1NUhhX1dDMjIySU1qRGdWZkdsZEM0YmxRVVVtU1dzMFB6SHNtU1dFNVZEV3oxT2ROczhWTmdKaWhYbHRBbE1YLWdNLVhRSWdBZDhENGozU09xSkl3Y0diaFhmM0tDUmwzYTRH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that early life stress disrupts dopamine signaling, altering social motivation and behavior. Scientists found that mice raised in stressful conditions were less likely to engage in social interactions compared to those with enriched experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identifies a weakened neural pathway between the ventral tegmental area and the basolateral amygdala as a key factor. Using advanced techniques to activate or silence dopamine neurons, researchers could artificially restore or suppress social motivation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that social avoidance behaviors may stem from disrupted neural circuits rather than inherent personality traits. The findings could inform new treatments for individuals with social difficulties linked to early life trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine and Social Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Early life stress reduces dopamine neuron connections between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala, impairing social motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Control of Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating dopamine neurons restored social behavior in stressed mice, while silencing them caused socially engaged mice to become avoidant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Human Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding these neural circuits may help develop interventions for social difficulties linked to childhood neglect or trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists have new insights into why previous experiences influence future behaviors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments in mice reveal that personal history, especially stressful events, influences how the brain processes whether something is positive or negative.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a first of its kind study, Tufts University School of Medicine researchers demonstrate that interfering with the neural circuits responsible for emotional decisions can increase or decrease socially avoidant behaviors in mice, regardless of whether they had enriched or adverse experiences as pups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, appearing February 13 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that antisocial behaviors associated with childhood neglect or related forms of abuse may result from dysfunctional dopamine signaling in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of motivation involve dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for pleasurable feelings. When a mammal does something that enhances the chances of survival, such as eat a tasty meal or engage in sex, dopamine levels surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans (and mice), positive social interactions are generally rewarded by a burst of activity in the ventral tegmental area—a pathway of dopamine-releasing neurons. It connects the basolateral amygdala, a clump of nerves in the midbrain where emotions are processed, to the prefrontal cortex, where the brain makes critical decisions surrounding emotion and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people with early life stress are losing the ability to send information from parts of the brain that are needed for motivated behaviors, it made sense that we’d see less crosstalk between these two areas,” says first author Bradly Stone, who conducted the research as a Tufts postdoctoral scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The result that turned our heads was that early life stress reduces the number of dopaminergic neurons between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala, suggesting that network architecture is impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, Stone and his colleagues leveraged cutting-edge laboratory techniques that allowed them to artificially activate or silence dopamine inputs into the basolateral amygdala from the ventral tegmental area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied this to a classic behavioral protocol in which a mouse is given the choice to investigate chambers with either a toy or a stranger mouse. Mice with carefree early days visited the stranger mouse as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, mice that experienced maternal neglect primarily opted to do nothing or interact with the toy. This was only revealed when the investigators activated the dopaminergic neurons between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, when dopaminergic neurons were turned off in animals with carefree early days, they started behaving like animals who grew up with maternal neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This experiment was a beautiful part to this story that really made me believe in the work,” says Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s evidence that social avoidance is governed by a delicate balance of interconnected neural elements and early life stress shapes these connections in a nuanced way that impairs their ability to function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#076d6269696e6162752975687462696562756047737261737429626372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Jennifer Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jennifer Rosenberg – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0088-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Life Stress Impairs VTA Coordination of BLA Network and Behavioral States&lt;/a&gt;” by Bradly Stone et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Life Stress Impairs VTA Coordination of BLA Network and Behavioral States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated behaviors, such as social interactions, are governed by the interplay between mesocorticolimbic structures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse childhood experiences and early life stress (ELS) can impact these networks and behaviors, which is associated with increased risk for psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is known that the VTA projects to both the BLA and mPFC, the influence of these inputs on local network activity which govern behavioral states – and whether ELS impacts VTA-mediated network communication – remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that VTA inputs influence BLA oscillations and entrainment of mPFC activity in mice, and that ELS weakens the ability of the VTA to coordinate BLA network states, while also impairing dopaminergic signaling between VTA and BLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of VTA&lt;sub&gt;BLA&lt;/sub&gt; terminals decreased social interaction in ELS mice, which can be recapitulated in control mice by inhibiting VTA-BLA communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ELS impacts social reward via the VTA-BLA dopamine network.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1VdnBiN3dPOHp1NUhhX1dDMjIySU1qRGdWZkdsZEM0YmxRVVVtU1dzMFB6SHNtU1dFNVZEV3oxT2ROczhWTmdKaWhYbHRBbE1YLWdNLVhRSWdBZDhENGozU09xSkl3Y0diaFhmM0tDUmwzYTRH</guid></item><item><title>Keeping your phone's internet off can boost well-being, focus, sleep, productivity, impulsivity (and more) - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOVEN2MmYzTFZHOFVlSDRPR2NPWF9SQUlndm1FX2FsYW82UnQ0Y3QzZUVjTDZYZGtmRzVYODdXd2FrTFNlbHM3eENub2tnNS1VbnlGcXZfMXBZSHg5UTg2SjBYLUxHMmU4c0tMNE5ZaFNoZnlrcFZTZDk0U1JNbTIzSE1MT01OaVlnS2VfODZSZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Happy, relaxed woman" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Happy-woman-1200x800.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Happy-woman-1200x800.jpg" alt="Happy, relaxed woman"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;(Photo by Alliance Images on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-group breakout-box has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking mobile internet for two weeks led to mental health improvements with an effect size larger than typically seen in antidepressant studies, improved sustained attention comparable to reversing 10 years of age-related decline, and increased well-being in 91% of participants in at least one key area&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Without mobile internet access, participants naturally spent more time socializing in person, exercising, and being outdoors. These shifts in behavior partially explained improvements in well-being, and some benefits persisted even after internet access was restored.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Only 25% of participants fully maintained the two-week mobile internet block, but even those who reduced their usage showed improvements. This suggests that less extreme approaches, such as time-limited internet blocking, could still provide significant benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDMONTON, Alberta —&lt;/strong&gt; New research reveals a surprisingly simple way to improve mental health and focus: turn off your phone’s internet. A month-long study found that blocking mobile internet access for just two weeks led to measurable improvements in well-being, mental health, and attention—comparable to the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy and reductions in age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from multiple universities across the U.S. and Canada worked with 467 iPhone users to test how removing constant internet access would affect their daily lives. Instead of asking people to give up their phones completely, the study took a more practical approach. Participants installed an app that blocked mobile internet while still allowing calls and texts. This way, phones remained useful for basic communication but lost their ability to provide endless scrolling, social media, and constant online access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/mobile-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;smartphone user&lt;/a&gt; now spends nearly 5 hours each day on their device. More than half of Americans with smartphones worry they use them too much, and this jumps to 80% for people under 30. Despite these concerns, few studies have actually tested what happens when people cut back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were significant. After two weeks without mobile internet, participants showed clear improvements in multiple areas. They reported &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;feeling happier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/strong-sense-oneness-greater-life-satisfaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;more satisfied with their lives&lt;/a&gt;, and their mental health improved—an effect size that was greater than what is typically seen with antidepressant medications in clinical trials. They also performed better on attention tests, showing improvements &lt;strong&gt;comparable to reversing 10 years of age-related cognitive decline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure attention, participants completed a computer task that tested their ability to stay focused over time. The improvements were meaningful—similar in size to the difference between an average adult and someone with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/adults-with-adhd-die-7-to-9-years-sooner-alarming-study-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;mild attention difficulties&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that constant mobile internet access may impair our natural ability to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study design was particularly strong because it included a swap halfway through. After the first two weeks, the groups switched roles—people who had blocked mobile internet got access back, while the other group had to block their internet. This strengthened the evidence that the improvements were caused by reduced mobile internet access rather than other factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An impressive 91% of participants improved in at least one area. Without the ability to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/no-escape-average-person-checks-phone-every-12-minutes-vacation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;check their phones&lt;/a&gt; constantly, people spent more time socializing in person, exercising, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/go-outside-for-your-sanity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;being outdoors&lt;/a&gt;—activities known to boost mental health and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, researchers checked in with participants via text messages to track their moods. Those who blocked mobile internet reported feeling progressively better over the two weeks. Even after regaining internet access, many retained some of their improvements, suggesting the break helped reshape their digital habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the benefits weren’t just from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;less screen time&lt;/a&gt;. While phone use dropped significantly during the study (from over 5 hours to under 3 hours daily), the improvements appeared linked specifically to breaking the habit of constant online connection. Even after getting internet access back, many participants kept their usage lower and continued feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One surprising finding involved people who started the study with a high “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fomo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;fear of missing out&lt;/a&gt;” (FOMO). Rather than making their anxiety worse, disconnecting from mobile internet led to the biggest improvements in their well-being. This suggests that constant access to social media and online updates may fuel digital anxiety rather than relieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blocking mobile internet also helped participants feel more in control of their behavior and improved their sleep. Without instant access to endless entertainment and social media, people reported having better control over their attention and averaged about 17 more minutes of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;sleep per night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, sticking to the program was difficult—only about 25% of participants kept their mobile internet blocked for the full two weeks. This highlights how dependent many of us have become on constant connectivity. Still, even those who didn’t fully adhere to the program showed improvements, suggesting that simply reducing mobile internet use can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that a less extreme approach might work better for most people. Instead of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/benefits-of-a-social-media-detox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;blocking all mobile internet&lt;/a&gt;, limiting access during certain times or restricting specific apps could provide similar benefits while being easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: reducing mobile internet access—even temporarily—can help improve &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and focus. While not everyone is ready to disconnect completely, finding ways to limit our online exposure could make us happier, healthier, and more present in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 467 iPhone users and randomly assigned them to two groups. One group blocked mobile internet access for the first two weeks while the other group served as a control. Then the groups switched for the next two weeks, with the control group blocking mobile internet while the first group regained access. This crossover design allowed researchers to compare changes within the same individuals and between groups. Participants completed surveys and cognitive tests at the beginning, after two weeks, and after four weeks. They also received periodic text messages asking about their mood and answered questions about how they spent their time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blocking mobile internet led to multiple significant improvements:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen time dropped from about 5 hours to under 3 hours daily&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mental health and wellbeing showed improvements larger than typical antidepressant effects&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sustained attention improved equivalent to being 10 years younger cognitively&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;91% of participants improved on at least one measure&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Benefits partially persisted even after mobile internet access was restored&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People spent more time socializing in person, exercising, and being in nature&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Those with higher initial FOMO showed greater improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sample consisted mostly of motivated participants who wanted to reduce their phone use. While half of Americans and 80% of those under 30 report wanting to cut back on smartphone use, the results might not apply to people less interested in changing their habits. Additionally, participants who completed the full study had better baseline mental health and attention compared to those who dropped out. The researchers acknowledge that expectancy effects (participants expecting to feel better) may have influenced some results, though the objective attention measures help validate the findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discussion-and-takeaways"&gt;Discussion and Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study provides some of the first causal evidence that constant mobile internet access may harm psychological functioning. The researchers suggest that humans may not be well-adapted to handle unlimited access to information, entertainment, and social connection. While smartphones offer many benefits, finding ways to limit constant connectivity could help optimize their impact on wellbeing. Less restrictive approaches, like blocking mobile internet at specific times or only blocking certain apps, might be more sustainable while still providing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The authors declared no competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocket engine manufacturer Ursa Major is accelerating the development of its Draper engine. The startup is collaborating with US agencies and military contractors to make the engine available for use in next-generation missile systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ursa Major aims to swiftly complete the testing phase of the Draper liquid rocket engine. The goal is for the engine to be available for missiles that will form a part of President Donald Trump’s Iron Dome missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Draper’s use of non-cryogenic kerosene peroxide fuel makes it easily deployable, while still enabling it to power missiles in space and in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-draper-engine-could-meet-iron-dome-requirements"&gt;Draper engine could meet Iron Dome requirements&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the US Air Force awarded Ursa Major &lt;a href="https://www.ursamajor.com/media/press-release/air-force-research-laboratory-selects-leading-ursa-major-for-hypersonics-and-launch-capabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;a contract&lt;/a&gt; to develop its Draper and Arroway engines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of that announcement, Ursa Major founder and CEO Joe Laurienti said, “Draper will become the foundation of America’s counter-hypersonic capabilities. Its on-demand launch capability and increased maneuverability make it an ideal hypersonic interceptor and allow it to better simulate hypersonic threats as a target vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, the startup successfully has completed a hot fire test campaign of the Draper engine at its facilities in Berthoud, Colorado. Now, the next step is to perform flight tests with Draper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ursa Major claims the engine can be used for military applications as well as for a host of applications within the commercial space sector. These include orbital transportation use cases, such as space tugs and satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/ursa-major-eyes-iron-dome-applications-for-its-mid-size-rocket-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with SpaceNews, Christopher Spagnoletti, chief product officer at Ursa Major, said “we believe Draper fills a gap that the United States has in its armaments and targets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is looking to fill this supposed gap with its Iron Dome &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/military/iron-dome-engineering-explained?group=test_b" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt;. In January President Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-directs-the-building-of-the-iron-dome-missile-defense-shield-for-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for the Defense Department to build an “Iron Dome for America”. The name is a clear reference to Israel’s Iron Dome defense system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Trump’s executive order, the US Iron Dome would serve as “a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.” Essentially, this system would use weapons to destroy incoming missiles during their boost phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-draper-s-state-of-the-art-capabilities"&gt;Draper’s state-of-the-art capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The private and public sectors will have to collaborate to level up propulsion technology if they are to make Trump’s Iron Dome a reality. The system will require state-of-the-art interceptor missiles that go beyond existing capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Spagnoletti, many existing propulsion systems struggle to fly the mass required for the initiative. He also explained that the new missiles required would have to operate from the ground as well as from space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s missile defense systems typically rely on solid rocket motors, as their fuel is more easily stored, allowing for faster deployment. However, the tradeoff is that solid motors don’t provide the same performance as liquid engines typically used in large rockets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ursa Major’s Draper engine uses a non-cryogenic kerosene peroxide fuel combination. That fuel remains liquid at room temperature, meaning it offers a simpler storage solution than the typical liquid oxygen engine. This eliminates the need for complex cooling systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Ursa Major, though, Draper provides the best of both worlds: it has the storable characteristics of a solid motor with the higher performance and maneuverability associated with liquid engines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spagnoletti also claimed the 4,000-lb-thrust Draper engine is designed for both space and atmospheric propulsion, making it ideal for the Iron Dome. If Ursa Major’s flight tests are a success, the next challenge will be to scale production of the Draper engine. &lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that teens with overweight or obesity consumed significantly more calories later in the day compared to those with a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By isolating circadian influences from environmental and behavioral factors, they confirmed that food intake peaks in the late afternoon and evening regardless of sleep duration or external time cues. The findings highlight the biological basis of eating patterns and suggest that modifying light exposure and meal timing could help manage weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circadian Influence on Eating:&lt;/strong&gt; The biological clock regulates food intake, peaking in the late afternoon and evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Weight Status:&lt;/strong&gt; Adolescents with overweight or obesity consumed more calories in the circadian evening than those with a healthy weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Adjusting light exposure and meal timing may help regulate eating patterns and support weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The causes of obesity are complex and influenced by many factors. While research has highlighted connections between sleep, eating patterns and weight gain, scientists remain uncertain of the role of the circadian system — the biological clock — in shaping eating patterns. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a new study from researchers at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Mass General Brigham reveals a distinct relationship between circadian rhythms, weight and eating habits in adolescents, a vulnerable age group whose eating patterns influence their lifelong health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107852"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a teen, a clock and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/body-clock-eating-neurodevelopment-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Carskadon said that the findings like those from the study could inform clinicians counseling adolescents on ways to manage their weight. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that adolescents whose weight was classified as “overweight” or “obese” consumed more calories later in the day compared to participants with healthy weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate that circadian rhythms play an important role in explaining later caloric intake in individuals at risk for obesity, said lead investigator Mary Carskadon, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown’s medical school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The critical nature of adolescent development to set the stage for a lifetime of health highlights the need to understand the roles played by sleep/wake and circadian timing processes for eating behavior,” said Carskadon, who also directs the Bradley Hospital Sleep Research Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The knowledge gained here opens a door to potential interventions that can enhance teen health moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Isolating circadian influences &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian system is composed of trillions of “clocks” present in virtually all organs, tissues and cells, which prepares biology and behavior to adapt to the changing demands across the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of the circadian system is known to differ between people due to a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have analyzed sleeping and eating behavior using measures of self-reported hunger and other variables, said study author David Barker, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior (research) at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some factors that set this study apart, Barker said, were the meticulous measuring of food before and after meals and the fact that environmental and behavioral influences were controlled for while the participants remained in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one volunteers between the ages of 12 and 18 participated in the study, which was conducted at the Bradley Hospital Sleep Research Laboratory. Participants were divided into three groups based on body mass index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were placed on 28-hour sleep and wake cycles — slightly longer than a typical 24-hour day — and stayed in a controlled dim-light setting while awake and in complete darkness during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants remained in the same space throughout the study, which lasted for 11 days and 10 nights. To control for outside influences on circadian rhythm, researchers removed all external time cues from the lab’s environment, including clocks and access to natural light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants received six opportunities to eat at fixed times across the wake episode, with a standardized menu and could consume as much food during the meal as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked the food that was eaten as well as caloric intake. During the day, they were monitored by student research apprentices from Brown University and other institutions, who offered opportunities to join in a variety of activities including making crafts, watching movies (with screen lights dimmed) and playing social games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that changes in the circadian system throughout the day and night significantly influenced food consumption. In all three groups, food intake peaked in the late afternoon and early evening and was lowest in the morning, even after accounting for behavioral and environmental factors, demonstrating that the body’s biological clock directly impacts how much people eat at different times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents in the obesity and overweight groups consumed significantly more calories in the circadian evening compared to those in the healthy weight group. Researchers found no significant differences in total sleep time between or within the groups across sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to study author Frank Scheer, director of the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, it was already well known that the circadian system affects hunger and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remained unclear, he said, was whether the circadian system — when isolated from influences of environmental and behavioral cycles, including light, sleep and activity cycles — directly influences food consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is the first to demonstrate that food intake itself is regulated by our internal body clock,” Scheer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Body clocks, food intake and weight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies are needed to determine whether affecting circadian control of food intake contributes to weight changes, if weight changes impact the circadian control of food intake, or a combination of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carskadon said that the findings like those from the study could inform clinicians counseling adolescents on ways to manage their weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the influence of circadian timing could be influenced by excluding light late in the day and enhancing bright light in the morning, especially while exercising,” Carskadon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That might help pull the rhythms to a better place — and also create healthy habits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With future research, the team aims to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between the circadian system, diet and metabolism, as well as the mechanisms underlying these relationships, and the implications for developing timed dietary interventions to improve health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01 DK101046), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL153969), the National Institutes of Health (R01-HL140574, R01-HL153969, R01-HL167746, R01-HL164454) and the COBRE Center for Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Child and Adolescent Mental Health funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (P20GM139743).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this circadian rhythm and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27444855554e4278574e4c524b67455548504909424352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Corrie Pikul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://brown.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Corrie Pikul – Brown University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:19:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5nX0YtUzdTaHhGdU5HMGZaNlVlU2oxTXYyYUYwbVZUaFZ1eEo2V0k5SmlYTEwyMWt3d1lNZXFaYm51N3JjLUdFM2NuajI3NlY2VEZJbU1RbE1GS1VKZV9yTTVncWNUUXBVRDBVWThsRnRfdw</guid></item><item><title>The wind may be partly to blame for bird flu spread between farms, a new study suggests - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOalpvMTFSZGIyQlVpZjVaanNBS3JnRkFpNGxQU3o3MDhqTXlFX2lFMU8zcE90VjJQNlhpWUtQMXdpakllZV8xZ1VnazVRY1Y5dGI0cDZ2NjRaMzVha0JQVWE1ZTYyNVZwc1BOek1LVTBUbXEwUTlvckpjc2k0UnFuU9IBd0FVX3lxTE0tcEtfMmdrNkhsa3ZoUDF5cWVQeXdUQk5qMXhsclk0YTJmTnRDVXdxb2NKYzZIeS1MaXlvVzJhYWF3WFJzWTVBd3lCa0NaS054RWZ1cWo3QW8tRk9mU28zWFJhbmlCRWhWVWpIRkRmZTVWVm03MzZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jkyqc00bq2cp4hskzagrf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In February 2024, government veterinarians in the Czech Republic investigating a bird flu outbreak found themselves in the middle of a puzzling case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000a2e6bnhhbernr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was devastating a flock of chickens on a highly secure farm, home of a breeding program that produced hybrid birds with specially colored feathers and eggs. A nearby facility owned by the same company also saw its chickens become infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000b2e6byhnhcrub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How had the virus gotten in? The facilities were state-of-the-art.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The water on the chicken farms was filtered, supplied by their own wells. The chicken houses had giant fans that created one-way air flow through the barns. The facility was surrounded by sturdy, well-maintained fencing that kept wild animals out. Employees weren’t even allowed to keep their own chickens at home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jyi7x00003b6mru2x72ur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their investigation led the researchers to conclude that this particular case involved a distinct set of “just right” conditions that allowed the virus to blow onto the chicken farm through the wind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001p2e6ba4bgi24h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wild&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;birds that carry flu viruses in their guts and shed them in their poop are believed to be the main way H5N1 has been introduced onto farms.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Still, experts say the windborne spread of bird flu has been suspected before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001q2e6bpy6uzp4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The whole idea of potentially being sort of wind-driven has been out there for a while,” said Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79mpwdo000u3b6mov9shcm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s incredibly hard to actually measure,” he said, “to get the definitive data to say yes or no.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001r2e6b6m78wujz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Webby&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wasn’t involved with the new study but said he’s been in touch with a veterinarian in California who believes wind may have played a role in the recent spread of H5N1 between some cattle herds in the Central Valley.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7ak0wx500013b5zj76x85rh@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79juxsx001g2e6bd1pdz152@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even if it is moving through the air, he said, that doesn’t necessarily make bird flu a bigger threat to people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79m2yug001y2e6bt6g93j28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one thing, the current versions of the H5N1 virus that are infecting animals don’t seem very good at infecting humans. The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to hone its craft and get better at breaking into human cells, but for the moment, there’s no sign that it’s made this leap to being a fully human pathogen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lyal5001w2e6b0xu0jlbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For another, it takes just a tiny amount of virus to make a bird sick, and it would probably take a lot more to infect a human. Particles, even viruses, disperse in air, meaning any virus in the wind is likely to be present in only very small amounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000c2e6bn064d7l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of the chicken farm in the Czech Republic, scientists’ only clue about the origins of the outbreak came from a nearby duck-fattening farm that, a week earlier, had also seen bird flu tear through its flocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000d2e6breeavf8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The duck farm, with 50,000 birds, was completely different from the chicken facility. It was near a lake that hosted wild ducks. The farmed ducks were kept in buildings with natural ventilation and a basic level of biosecurity – the precautions taken to safeguard animals on a farm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000e2e6bxhasdqsg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The course of the infection on the duck farm looked very different than what played out with the chickens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79kblu800033b6miyzc1ot2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bird flu swept through the duck houses like wildfire. On February 4, the first day of the outbreak, 800 ducks died. Within two days, 5,000 had died. On February 7 and 9, the entire flock was depopulated to control the spread of the infection and prevent greater suffering for the birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000g2e6bemuf1z1j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The chickens at the breeding facility were different in another way, too: They got sick slowly. Over the course of a week, they gradually stopped eating and drinking as much, and the farm owners noticed that a few birds were dying, mostly near the barns’ air intake vents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000h2e6bxga32wwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eventually, the infection spread to both barns in the breeding facility and another barn at the second location.  Thousands of birds were lost, including critical breeding stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000i2e6b5ku8qrwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government’s veterinary investigators collected samples of the viruses that had infected the ducks, the chickens at the breeding facility and chickens at the second farm to see what they could learn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000j2e6bdsv8yd5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three H5N1 strains sequenced from the duck farm were genetically identical to strains found in the birds that first got sick on each farm, suggesting that the duck farm had been the source of the chicken outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000k2e6bpmjxl56f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But how? The duck farm was nearly 5 miles west of the chicken facilities, and investigators couldn’t find any physical links between the two. None of the people who worked on the duck farm ever went to the chicken farms; even the contractors who dropped off supplies or came to collect waste were different. The investigators said they ruled out any human connections between the farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000l2e6b8hiywp5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no major bodies of water near the chicken farm, which steered them away from the idea that wild birds might have carried in the flu virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000m2e6bt953hw6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, the researchers checked the weather patterns for the week the chickens got sick. There had been a steady breeze from the west. There was extensive cloud cover, which would have blocked germ-killing UV light from the sun. The temperature was cool but not freezing, between 40 and 50 degrees, and viruses love cold air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79kfczq00063b6mximsmf03@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, perfect conditions to transport a virus and allow it to survive a long trip.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000n2e6bu3ku74cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Kamil Sedlak, who directs the State Veterinary Institute in Prague and is senior author on the study, says that after they explored all the possibilities, windborne spread was the best fit in this case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000o2e6b97zyuao8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that under certain specific conditions, the spread of the avian influenza virus by wind can occur,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ltb08001u2e6big6r6cem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Czech researchers published their study &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1.full" target="_blank"&gt;as a preprint&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of peer review.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ml8oj000o3b6mfehn725t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Webby said the virus particles could also have hitched a ride on something larger, like dander from the ducks, and that’s what allowed them to travel so far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000p2e6bgwv3v8c8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors didn’t try to sample the air near the duck or chicken farms for virus, and they note that previous air sampling studies in and around swine barns and poultry houses have detected high levels of avian influenza viruses. Concentrations of the virus quickly dissipate, though, as air travels away from barns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000q2e6bpisi78b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be why the chickens got sick more slowly: They were getting a lower dose of the virus from very low levels carried in the air. The fact that the first chickens to die were near the air intake vents was another clue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000r2e6bk7n7ph0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that they’re making a compelling case based on the knowledge they had of the farms,” said Dr. Montse Torremorell, professor and chair of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000s2e6bot0bd66s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Torremorell &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27610723/" target="_blank"&gt;conducted air sampling&lt;/a&gt; around poultry barns during the last major outbreak of avian influenza in the United States in 2015. She found high levels of infectious virus blowing out of the large exhaust fans in poultry houses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ki54e00093b6m0ulhp4m3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not just a matter of how much virus is blowing out into the air, she said, but also where it lands. Those plumes of infectious aerosols may end up on clothing, equipment and vehicles that can also carry the virus from one place to the next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000u2e6bhriua8xl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Torremorell said airborne spread should be something farms consider when they’re thinking about ways to protect their livestock and flocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000v2e6bc20ghbns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the airborne transmission should be on the table,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000w2e6bcimaey0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s tricky to bring up because people might hear “airborne spread” and feel powerless to stop the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000x2e6bq0bozeev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Often, people say, ‘Oh, it’s in the wind. I cannot do anything about it.’ Then they stop doing the basic biosecurity that it’s also very important that they have to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000y2e6b1pe0mrau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she says they’re forgetting lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic about how stopping the spread of a virus requires layered approaches to protection. Current precautions like restricting entry to farms and wearing personal protective equipment should be kept in place, but filtering the air in barns could also help protect animals and farmworkers from bird flu, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00102e6b1zuuzg3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also thinks windborne spread is playing a role in H5N1 transmission now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00112e6botd36otf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think there is more wind-driven H5N1 occurring right now in the community because of the number of aquatic of waterfowl that are infected,” he said.

            Waterfowl like ducks and geese poop in lakes, he says, and wind blowing over that water may carry the virus to nearby farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00122e6b5ehg2ces@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in unprecedented territory right now,” Osterholm said. “It’s all over the country.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00132e6bgxf6z2qc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osterholm thinks airborne or windborne spread might account for some infections in which a source of the virus – like contact with a sick animal – couldn’t be identified. The recent case of the three veterinarians who tested positive for antibodies against the H5N1 virus at a conference comes to mind. Two of the three had no known exposure to sick animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00152e6b47zta8in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very low-risk for humans to be infected with the virus like that, but I think it happens,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jkyqc00bq2cp4hskzagrf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In February 2024, government veterinarians in the Czech Republic investigating a bird flu outbreak found themselves in the middle of a puzzling case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000a2e6bnhhbernr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was devastating a flock of chickens on a highly secure farm, home of a breeding program that produced hybrid birds with specially colored feathers and eggs. A nearby facility owned by the same company also saw its chickens become infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000b2e6byhnhcrub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How had the virus gotten in? The facilities were state-of-the-art.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The water on the chicken farms was filtered, supplied by their own wells. The chicken houses had giant fans that created one-way air flow through the barns. The facility was surrounded by sturdy, well-maintained fencing that kept wild animals out. Employees weren’t even allowed to keep their own chickens at home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jyi7x00003b6mru2x72ur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their investigation led the researchers to conclude that this particular case involved a distinct set of “just right” conditions that allowed the virus to blow onto the chicken farm through the wind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001p2e6ba4bgi24h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wild&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;birds that carry flu viruses in their guts and shed them in their poop are believed to be the main way H5N1 has been introduced onto farms.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Still, experts say the windborne spread of bird flu has been suspected before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001q2e6bpy6uzp4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The whole idea of potentially being sort of wind-driven has been out there for a while,” said Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79mpwdo000u3b6mov9shcm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s incredibly hard to actually measure,” he said, “to get the definitive data to say yes or no.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lslju001r2e6b6m78wujz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Webby&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wasn’t involved with the new study but said he’s been in touch with a veterinarian in California who believes wind may have played a role in the recent spread of H5N1 between some cattle herds in the Central Valley.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7ak0wx500013b5zj76x85rh@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79juxsx001g2e6bd1pdz152@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even if it is moving through the air, he said, that doesn’t necessarily make bird flu a bigger threat to people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79m2yug001y2e6bt6g93j28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one thing, the current versions of the H5N1 virus that are infecting animals don’t seem very good at infecting humans. The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to hone its craft and get better at breaking into human cells, but for the moment, there’s no sign that it’s made this leap to being a fully human pathogen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79lyal5001w2e6b0xu0jlbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For another, it takes just a tiny amount of virus to make a bird sick, and it would probably take a lot more to infect a human. Particles, even viruses, disperse in air, meaning any virus in the wind is likely to be present in only very small amounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000c2e6bn064d7l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of the chicken farm in the Czech Republic, scientists’ only clue about the origins of the outbreak came from a nearby duck-fattening farm that, a week earlier, had also seen bird flu tear through its flocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000d2e6breeavf8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The duck farm, with 50,000 birds, was completely different from the chicken facility. It was near a lake that hosted wild ducks. The farmed ducks were kept in buildings with natural ventilation and a basic level of biosecurity – the precautions taken to safeguard animals on a farm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7w9000e2e6bxhasdqsg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The course of the infection on the duck farm looked very different than what played out with the chickens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79kblu800033b6miyzc1ot2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bird flu swept through the duck houses like wildfire. On February 4, the first day of the outbreak, 800 ducks died. Within two days, 5,000 had died. On February 7 and 9, the entire flock was depopulated to control the spread of the infection and prevent greater suffering for the birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000g2e6bemuf1z1j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The chickens at the breeding facility were different in another way, too: They got sick slowly. Over the course of a week, they gradually stopped eating and drinking as much, and the farm owners noticed that a few birds were dying, mostly near the barns’ air intake vents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000h2e6bxga32wwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eventually, the infection spread to both barns in the breeding facility and another barn at the second location.  Thousands of birds were lost, including critical breeding stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000i2e6b5ku8qrwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government’s veterinary investigators collected samples of the viruses that had infected the ducks, the chickens at the breeding facility and chickens at the second farm to see what they could learn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000j2e6bdsv8yd5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three H5N1 strains sequenced from the duck farm were genetically identical to strains found in the birds that first got sick on each farm, suggesting that the duck farm had been the source of the chicken outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000k2e6bpmjxl56f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But how? The duck farm was nearly 5 miles west of the chicken facilities, and investigators couldn’t find any physical links between the two. None of the people who worked on the duck farm ever went to the chicken farms; even the contractors who dropped off supplies or came to collect waste were different. The investigators said they ruled out any human connections between the farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000l2e6b8hiywp5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no major bodies of water near the chicken farm, which steered them away from the idea that wild birds might have carried in the flu virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000m2e6bt953hw6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, the researchers checked the weather patterns for the week the chickens got sick. There had been a steady breeze from the west. There was extensive cloud cover, which would have blocked germ-killing UV light from the sun. The temperature was cool but not freezing, between 40 and 50 degrees, and viruses love cold air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79kfczq00063b6mximsmf03@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, perfect conditions to transport a virus and allow it to survive a long trip.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000n2e6bu3ku74cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Kamil Sedlak, who directs the State Veterinary Institute in Prague and is senior author on the study, says that after they explored all the possibilities, windborne spread was the best fit in this case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000o2e6b97zyuao8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that under certain specific conditions, the spread of the avian influenza virus by wind can occur,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ltb08001u2e6big6r6cem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Czech researchers published their study &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1.full" target="_blank"&gt;as a preprint&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of peer review.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ml8oj000o3b6mfehn725t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Webby said the virus particles could also have hitched a ride on something larger, like dander from the ducks, and that’s what allowed them to travel so far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000p2e6bgwv3v8c8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors didn’t try to sample the air near the duck or chicken farms for virus, and they note that previous air sampling studies in and around swine barns and poultry houses have detected high levels of avian influenza viruses. Concentrations of the virus quickly dissipate, though, as air travels away from barns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000q2e6bpisi78b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be why the chickens got sick more slowly: They were getting a lower dose of the virus from very low levels carried in the air. The fact that the first chickens to die were near the air intake vents was another clue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000r2e6bk7n7ph0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that they’re making a compelling case based on the knowledge they had of the farms,” said Dr. Montse Torremorell, professor and chair of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000s2e6bot0bd66s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Torremorell &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27610723/" target="_blank"&gt;conducted air sampling&lt;/a&gt; around poultry barns during the last major outbreak of avian influenza in the United States in 2015. She found high levels of infectious virus blowing out of the large exhaust fans in poultry houses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79ki54e00093b6m0ulhp4m3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not just a matter of how much virus is blowing out into the air, she said, but also where it lands. Those plumes of infectious aerosols may end up on clothing, equipment and vehicles that can also carry the virus from one place to the next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000u2e6bhriua8xl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Torremorell said airborne spread should be something farms consider when they’re thinking about ways to protect their livestock and flocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000v2e6bc20ghbns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the airborne transmission should be on the table,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000w2e6bcimaey0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s tricky to bring up because people might hear “airborne spread” and feel powerless to stop the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000x2e6bq0bozeev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Often, people say, ‘Oh, it’s in the wind. I cannot do anything about it.’ Then they stop doing the basic biosecurity that it’s also very important that they have to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa000y2e6b1pe0mrau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she says they’re forgetting lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic about how stopping the spread of a virus requires layered approaches to protection. Current precautions like restricting entry to farms and wearing personal protective equipment should be kept in place, but filtering the air in barns could also help protect animals and farmworkers from bird flu, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00102e6b1zuuzg3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also thinks windborne spread is playing a role in H5N1 transmission now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00112e6botd36otf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think there is more wind-driven H5N1 occurring right now in the community because of the number of aquatic of waterfowl that are infected,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79kk0c6000c3b6m6f276c0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Waterfowl like ducks and geese poop in lakes, he says, and wind blowing over that water may carry the virus to nearby farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00122e6b5ehg2ces@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in unprecedented territory right now,” Osterholm said. “It’s all over the country.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79jq7wa00132e6bgxf6z2qc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osterholm thinks airborne or windborne spread might account for some infections in which a source of the virus – like contact with a sick animal – couldn’t be identified.

Grounding, so the claim goes, allows electrons (also negatively charged) to flow into your body, which would otherwise be blocked by insulating materials such as rubber-soled shoes. The ostensible benefits include, but are not limited to: improved sleep, metabolism and blood circulation; reductions in inflammation, and in cardiovascular disease risk and pain; and relief from PMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Grounding takes its name from a legitimate concept in electricity. Karen Livesey, an associate professor of theoretical physics at the University of Newcastle, describes it this way: “When you deliberately take an object that has possibly an excess negative or positive charge, and you connect it to the Earth so that the charges all equalise out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The object ends up with the same charge density that the Earth has,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We’re constantly building up positive and negative charges on the surface of our bodies – take static electricity, for instance. “If you’ve got woollen socks on and you walk across the carpet, that rubbing between the socks and the carpet transfers charge, and you can develop quite a strong positive charge,” Livesey says. “You touch a doorknob, and suddenly that charge transfers to the ground.” The shock you feel results from the charge being neutralised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Negative charges from the Earth could, in theory, penetrate the body, but typically excess charge remains on the surface, Livesey says. “What we’re seeing in the literature is no causal link [explaining] why having a build up of charge could adversely affect our health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;No dubious wellness trend is complete without someone turning a buck on it, so for those who live in cities or are otherwise precluded from regularly shoving their toes in the dirt, there is an assortment of conductive items people can plug into the grounding sockets of electrical outlets to get the same purported effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;You can stand on grounding mats, sleep with grounding mattress covers and sheets, and even wear grounding socks – a Choice &lt;a href="https://www.choice.com.au/shonky-awards/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2024/groundingwell-grounding-socks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Shonkys winner&lt;/a&gt; last year.

To put grounding into perspective, Livesey says appliances in our homes draw a maximum current of 63 amps. In comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25435837/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that a sleeping person connected to the Earth via grounding bedsheets produced a current of up to 10 nanoamps – that is, more than one billion times smaller. “These tiny currents are almost undetectable,” Livesey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Playing devil’s advocate, let’s say electrons from the Earth do make it into your body when you dig your heels into some sand. What effect would they have? One claim is that electrons from grounding can neutralise &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/23/vitamin-supplements-antioxidants-freeradicals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;, the reactive molecules that cause damage to cells. It’s a claim that sounds good but doesn’t stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The concept that electrons flow through the body and neutralise oxidative stress is really quite a vague concept,” says Prof Judy de Haan, who leads the cardiovascular inflammation and redox biology laboratory at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Not all free radicals are charged particles, so the idea of neutralising something which isn’t charged doesn’t always make sense. Indeed, in some instances the addition of electrons may exacerbate oxidative stress and cellular damage,” de Haan says, adding that the body has its own natural mechanisms for dealing with oxidative stress, such as antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The few scientific papers published on grounding have a “lack of scientific rigour”, de Haan says, with small sample sizes and poor study design. “When clinical trials are conducted, the important thing is that the researcher and the patient are both unaware of what the treatment might be,” she says – a feature known as double blinding, which reduces bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-experts-recommend-instead" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do the experts recommend instead?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One thing grounding proponents have gotten right is that there is solid evidence that spending time in nature – shoeless or not – is good for your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The benefits of nature contact are ample and myriad,” says Prof Thomas Astell-Burt at the University of Wollongong. Longitudinal research he has led with Prof Xiaoqi Feng at the University of New South Wales found that people living in leafier city neighbourhoods are at lower risk of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as facing a lower risk of psychological distress, loneliness, sleep insufficiency and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1f0a5e01-6371-48ac-81fc-1753260f0097" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":19,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoors","elementId":"1f0a5e01-6371-48ac-81fc-1753260f0097","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re consistently seeing a 30% landcover of parkland and especially tree canopy being the bare minimum to observe &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31722373/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consistent benefits&lt;/a&gt; across health behaviours and mental, physical, and social health outcomes,” Astell-Burt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Just being in nature, or a view of it, can help us feel less stressed and better able to concentrate on things that matter to us,” he says. Green spaces “provide attractive settings to keep physically active, solo or with others, and opportunities for solace and respite,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Walking in nature – of course that’s going to be beneficial,” de Haan says. “I don’t know whether touching the earth with your bare feet is going to make the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So by all means go outside and, as the kids say, touch grass.

ROACH: I’m 65 years old, and for the past year, I have not been able to maintain an erection while making love with my wife. I can still ejaculate, just not inside her. With cuddling and heavy petting, which we both enjoy, I do get the necessary erection, but it’s usually short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PEFMJ4UNVCRVERJBCNICWGC4A"&gt;I am mostly healthy, work out every day, and try to eat right. I’ve recently seen a new doctor for a general checkup, but lab results did not include my testosterone level. Since this is a totally new experience for me, should I ask for such a test? How can I ask the right questions without embarrassing myself or the medical staff? Any advice for this novice erectile dysfunction (ED) patient would be appreciated. -- S.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SYFDTJT6WFFOTETFNVIWUZOXLA"&gt;ANSWER: The best advice is to make another appointment to discuss ED. It is very common in 65-year-olds; your doctor won’t be embarrassed about it at all, and neither should you. Sexual function is an important part of health for both men and women, and problems in this system need to be properly diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FUNOCKLI4ZCGTIAPBA7BJXKIGM"&gt;This is particularly the case for ED in men as it can be a sign of serious problems -- not only with testosterone but with blockages in the blood vessels. Your doctor will likely order a blood testosterone test but may do additional testing to help find the cause, even though no specific cause can be identified most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4L7BYQSEL5AZ3BOFGT73YBZSWY"&gt;Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar medicines is likely to be effective. Although I see ads for doctors you can consult with by phone to get these medications, I strongly urge you to see your own doctor.

ROACH: I was offered a low price to get abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening. Is it worthwhile? Who should get screened? -- K.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PG266QOVWFGEJIWCAKOIZDSQOI"&gt;ANSWER: The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body that comes directly off of the heart, goes down through the chest and diaphragm via the aortic hiatus, and into the abdomen. From there, it splits into two iliac arteries to provide blood to the pelvis and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W7PDJG3EU5EA3C6ANYTKRRKNK4"&gt;An AAA is a dilation of this large blood vessel. If the aorta dilates too much, the wall weakens, and the aorta can rupture -- a catastrophe few people survive. For this reason, people who are at a higher risk for AAAs are recommended for screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOZODB3FAZD3BCTPFSYTSXB73U"&gt;The usual recommendations of screening for men include those between 65-75 who have smoked. An ultrasound is a great screening test as it has no ionizing radiation and is very accurate. It is also reasonable to screen men and women who have a family history of needing an AAA repair or death due to an aortic rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="37RFHXMRM5CUVDYZEJKYZIM4KE"&gt;Screening is otherwise unlikely to lead to improved outcomes, so I don’t recommend AAA screening for low-risk men or women, regardless of the out-of-pocket cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

After reading one of your articles, I told my doctor I wanted to try stopping statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RFB7J7U7BFD4HLS24ZPFCTSLOA"&gt;She prescribed Repatha injections instead.

It is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). When I took it for two years, my gut motility eventually shut down to almost zero. Four gastroenterologists told me that my symptoms could not be caused by the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZUFBXCTAZGHJKCBPW5VVCALMM"&gt;After they proposed surgery to remove my intestines, I decided to stop the drug.

Researchers analyzed data from over 172,000 participants and found that those with depression accrued an average of 0.2 additional conditions per year, compared to 0.16 in those without. Common conditions included osteoarthritis, hypertension, and acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest depression is more than just a mental health disorder—it affects overall physical health. Current healthcare models focus on treating individual conditions, but an integrated approach is needed. Addressing both mental and physical health together could improve long-term outcomes for those with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Disease Progression:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with depression develop physical conditions 30% faster than those without.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Osteoarthritis, hypertension, and acid reflux were among the most frequently developed illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings highlight the need for integrated mental and physical healthcare approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults with a history of depression gain long-term physical conditions around 30% faster than those without, according to research publishing February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Kelly Fleetwood of the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom, and colleagues argue that their study suggests depression should be viewed as a ‘whole body’ condition, and integrated approaches should be used to manage mental and physical health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is the most common mental health condition and is associated with a range of adverse physical health outcomes such as heart disease and diabetes. Past research has compared people with and without depression to see how many physical conditions they develop over time, but most studies look at a small number of illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleetwood and colleagues aimed to quantify the association between depression and the rate at which conditions accrued in midlife and older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team included 172,556 volunteers in the UK Biobank study, aged 40-71 years, who completed a baseline assessment between 2006 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They selected 69 physical conditions and followed participants for an average of 6.9 years. Initially, those with depression had an average of three physical conditions compared with an average of two in those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the study period, adults with a history of depression accrued an average of 0.2 additional physical conditions per year, while those without accrued 0.16. The most common new conditions were osteoarthritis (15.7% of those with depression at baseline vs 12.5% without), hypertension (12.9% vs 12.0%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (13.8% vs 9.6%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlight that previous diagnosis of depression is a marker of risk for development of long-term physical health conditions during middle and older-age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most healthcare systems are designed to treat individual conditions rather than individuals with multiple conditions, and the authors believe that integrated approaches to managing both mental and physical health could improve care and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “People who’ve experienced depression are more likely to develop long-term physical health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes; however, existing healthcare systems are designed to treat individual conditions, instead of individual people with multiple conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need healthcare services to take an integrated approach to caring for people who have both depression and long-term physical health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the Medical Research Council (https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/)/National Institute for Health Research (https://www.nihr.ac.uk/) (MC/S028013) (BG [principal investigator]; CS, JN, SM, CJ, DM, DS [co-investigators]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this health and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0cdc5c4c9c3c9cec5d0d2c5d3d3e0d0cccfd38ecfd2c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A cohort study of physical health condition accrual in UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;” by Kelly Fleetwood et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cohort study of physical health condition accrual in UK Biobank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is associated with a range of adverse physical health outcomes. We aimed to quantify the association between depression and the subsequent rate of accrual of long-term physical health conditions in middle and older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods and findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 172,556 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study, aged 40–71 years old at baseline assessment (2006–2010), who had linked primary care data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using self-report, primary care, hospital admission, cancer registry, and death records, we ascertained 69 long-term physical health conditions at both UKB baseline assessment and during a mean follow-up of 6.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used quasi-Poisson models to estimate associations between history of depression at baseline and subsequent rate of physical condition accrual. Within our cohort, 30,770 (17.8%) had a history of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those without depression, participants with depression had more physical conditions at baseline (mean 2.9 [SD 2.3] versus 2.1 [SD 1.9]) and accrued additional physical conditions at a faster rate (mean 0.20 versus 0.16 additional conditions/year during follow-up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjustment for age and sex, participants with depression accrued physical morbidities at a faster rate than those without depression (RR 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.31, 1.34]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjustment for all sociodemographic characteristics, the rate of condition accrual remained higher in those with versus without depression (RR 1.30, 95% CI [1.28, 1.32]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association attenuated but remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for baseline condition count and social/lifestyle factors (RR 1.10, 95% CI [1.09, 1.12]). The main limitation of this study is healthy volunteer selection bias, which may limit generalisability of findings to the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle-aged and older adults with a history of depression have more long-term physical health conditions at baseline and accrue additional physical conditions at a faster rate than those without a history of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlight the importance of integrated approaches to managing both mental and physical health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:59:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBZaU5Qd0ozWnQ0LTh0akQwNGw0N1pwcnpKeUxVZF84cGJnWFBOSElRTTBOUnhsdEIzZnEwZlhKQ1pIV2pNdVdrcko0bjdmYjVnSEI5WEZZakFkS2tBWHdBbDJ0SnJQTnZDZEl5OWEwR3NjWFJGeTRJX1VvV0VVZw</guid></item><item><title>Using CRISPR to remove extra chromosomes in Down syndrome - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSDZaOVdjdF9GdjZEaFRvODBFZU9nWVZ2b2d6bHRITmNOS3FSM2EzY0c2SDRjRXhxX1FxeUk1WDhrTGF5ZUp3WkVOcHZySXpKbW1BdWY5YldtR1hxQkM1ejYxRHdtN2s3bkpwSmljYnhKQy13c2FGcUZEYi1aYkp0UUEyaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene editing techniques may eventually allow trisomy to be treated at the cellular level, according to an in vitro proof-of-concept study.&lt;/p&gt;

The condition occurs in approximately 1 in 700 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/live+births/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;live births&lt;/a&gt; and is relatively easy to diagnose at early stages of development. However, there are no treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryotaro Hashizume and colleagues used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to cleave the third chromosome in previously generated trisomy 21 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+lines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell lines&lt;/a&gt; derived from both pluripotent cells and skin fibroblasts. The technique is able to identify which chromosome has been duplicated, which is necessary to ensure the cell does not end up with two identical copies after removal, but instead has one from each parent. The study is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf022/8016019" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to remove duplicate chromosomes from both induced pluripotent stem cells and fibroblasts. Suppressing chromosomal DNA repair ability increased the rate of duplicate chromosome elimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors show that the chromosomal rescue reversibly restores both &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; and cellular phenotypes. The approach is not yet ready for in vivo application, however, in part because the current technique can also change the retained chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, similar approaches could eventually be used in neurons and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glial+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glial cells&lt;/a&gt; and form the basis of novel medical interventions for people with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Suneel Kamath is an oncologist specializing in early-onset colorectal cancers at the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor on the frontlines of America's colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-ca1ae280-ed79-11ef-9a37-ebf534ae0853" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; crisis in young people has revealed the breakfast scientifically proven to stave off the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Suneel Kamath, an oncologist specializing in early-onset colorectal cancers at the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, told DailyMail.com that mounting research shows how calcium and fiber can protect against the deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With this in mind, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14397699/MOBO-founder-Kanya-King-signs-colon-cancer.html"&gt;colon cancer &lt;/a&gt;expert says breakfast is the perfect meal to pack these ingredients into, as there are lots of food options to play with.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14389701/harvard-doctors-discover-daily-snack-cuts-colon-cancer-risk.html"&gt;A recent study from Harvard University &lt;/a&gt;found that people who eat at least two servings of yogurt a week could lower their risk of colon cancers caused by bacteria by 20 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It followed a study funded by Cancer Research UK in January that found drinking a large glass of milk could be linked to a 17 per cent decrease in the risk of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, many &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13161165/Im-cancer-dietitian-3-high-fibre-breakfasts-help-prevent-colon-cancer-killing-young-people-ever.html"&gt;colon cancer experts say that fiber &lt;/a&gt;is key in preventing the disease as it feeds 'good' bacteria in the gut that shield the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kamath's first breakfast suggestion is overnight oats with milk, with berries for an extra boost of vitamin C and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other ingredients comprise non-fat Greek yogurt, honey, and either homemade or store-bought granola. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An 8oz serving provides almost 20 percent (4g) of the recommended daily amount of fiber and 13 percent of your calcium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;THE RECIPES ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS ARTICLE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kamath's first breakfast suggestion is a yogurt parfait with berries, for an extra boost of vitamin C and antioxidants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says oats, which are wholegrain, are an excellent source of fiber, and which like calcium, has been shown to safeguard against colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The oats contain lots of fiber and keep you full, which has the added effect of clearing out the colon and feeding the 'good' bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber is broken down by the body's gut microbiota - the ecosystem of bacteria, fungi and viruses - through a process called fermentation, which produces beneficial microbes that help protect against colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study suggests that eating three servings (90 grams) of whole grains daily reduces the risk of colorectal cancer by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you prefer to consume your breakfast on the go, Dr Kamath suggests blending a smoothie with oats, yoghurt and milk.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If neither of the previous options tickle your fancy, his third suggestion is a yoghurt parfait. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to dairy, a recent study found that an additional 300mg of calcium a day – about the amount in a large glass of milk – could be linked to a 17 per cent decrease in the risk of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists analyzed dietary data from more than 542,000 women to investigate the link between 97 products and nutrients and the chances of someone developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings showed that food and drink rich in calcium such as milk and yoghurt were linked to a lower risk of a diagnosis over 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Calcium was found to have a similar effect from both dairy and non-dairy sources, suggesting it was the main factor responsible for cutting risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with being packed with calcium thanks to the addition of yogurt and milk, a serving of overnight oats provides up to 20 percent of the recommended daily fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions.

There is a drop in 2020 because the Covid pandemic led to fewer people coming forward for screenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the importance of carefully selecting your breakfast ingredients, Dr Kamath says: 'Seems like dairy is beneficial in preventing colorectal cancer, which is an easy thing culturally to add to our diets, especially for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It seems to mainly driven by calcium intake, so probably adding other foods with calcium would also be beneficial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US has the sixth highest rate of early-onset cancers, with 87 cases per 100,000 people under 50, and colon cancer is among the fastest rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the University of Missouri-Kansas City recently looked at rates of colorectal cancer in people 10 to 44 years old over the last two decades and found cases had risen in all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rate of colorectal cancers grew 500 percent among children ages 10 to 14 and 333 percent among teenagers aged 15 to 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates rose by 71 percent among people 30 to 34 to seven cases per 100,000 people. Among people 35 to 39, rates rose by 58 percent to 12 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many young patients have their symptoms dismissed for more benign gastrointestinal conditions, leading to a more aggressive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-86cac450-ed65-11ef-94fe-df97152ace49" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14406231/breakfast-scientifically-proven-lower-risk-colon-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Dr Suneel Kamath's top breakfasts to help stave off colon cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;OAT MILK SMOOTHIE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup rolled oats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;1 cup milk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 large banana&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;1-2 tbsp nut butter of choice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tsp honey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;2 ice cubes (optional)*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a microwave-safe bowl, combine oatmeal and water.

    &lt;p&gt;Neighborhood pharmacies are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/pharmacy-deserts-across-us-drug-stores-closures-spread.html"&gt;rapidly shuttering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, Walgreens, one of the nation’s biggest pharmacy chains, announced plans &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why"&gt;to close 1,200 stores over the next three years&lt;/a&gt;. That’s part of a larger trend that has seen nearly &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pharmacy-closure-drugstore-cvs-walgreens-rite-aid-91967f18c0c059415b98fcf67ad0f84e"&gt;7,000 pharmacy locations close since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, with more expected in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many community pharmacies are struggling to stay open due to an overburdened workforce, shrinking reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/CEO-Blog/recent-pharmacy-closures-and-ecaps-legislation"&gt;limited opportunities to bill insurers for services beyond dispensing medications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/people/lucas-allan-berenbrok"&gt;As&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.osu.edu/directory/michael-murphy"&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/people/sophia-m-c-herbert"&gt;pharmacists&lt;/a&gt; who advocate for and take care of patients in community settings, we’ve witnessed this decline firsthand. The loss of local pharmacies threatens individual and community access to medications, pharmacist expertise and essential public health resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The changing role of pharmacies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community pharmacies – which include independently owned, corporate-chain and other retail pharmacies in neighborhood settings – have changed a lot over the past decades. What once were simple medication pickup points have evolved into hubs for health and wellness. Beyond dispensing prescriptions, pharmacists today provide vaccinations, testing and treatment for infectious diseases, access to hormonal birth control and other clinical services they’re empowered to provide by &lt;a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/pages/default.aspx"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://naspa.us/blog/restopic/state-policy/"&gt;state laws&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their importance, then, why have so many community pharmacies been closing?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons, but the most important is reduced reimbursement for prescription drugs. Most community pharmacies operate under a business model centered on dispensing medications that relies on insurer reimbursements and cash payments from patients. Minor revenue comes from front-end sales of over-the-counter products and other items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-pharmacy-benefit-managers-a-health-economist-explains-how-lack-of-competition-drives-up-drug-prices-for-everyone-236772"&gt;pharmacy benefit managers&lt;/a&gt; – companies that manage prescription drug benefits for insurers and employers – &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/pbm-price-negotiations-have-unintended-consequences-for-independent-pharmacies"&gt;have aggressively cut reimbursement rates in an effort to lower drug costs in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, pharmacists often have to dispense prescription drugs at very low margins or even at a loss. In some cases, pharmacists are forced to transfer prescriptions to other pharmacies willing to absorb the financial hit. Other times, pharmacists choose &lt;a href="https://ncpa.org/newsroom/news-releases/2024/10/15/independent-pharmacies-reluctant-stock-drugs-medicare-negotiation"&gt;not to stock these drugs at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just mom-and-pop operations feeling the pinch. Over the past four years, the three largest pharmacy chains have announced plans to close hundreds of stores nationwide. CVS kicked off the trend in 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/business/walgreens-cvs-store-closures/index.html#:%7E:text=CVS%2C%20the%20largest%20US%20chain,closing%20up%20to%20500%20stores."&gt;by announcing plans to close 900 pharmacy locations&lt;/a&gt;. In late 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/rite-aid-bankruptcy-filing-opioid-a7e9ffe5"&gt;Rite Aid said&lt;/a&gt; that thousands of its stores would be at risk for closure due to bankruptcy. And late in 2024, Walgreens &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why"&gt;announced its plans&lt;/a&gt; to close 1,200 stores over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, pharmacists, like many other health care providers, &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/pharmacists-report-high-levels-of-burnout-resulting-in-understaffing-and-alternative-career-paths"&gt;have been facing burnout&lt;/a&gt; due to high stress and the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.aacp.org/research/institutional-research/student-applications-enrollments-and-degrees-conferred"&gt;pharmacy school enrollment has declined&lt;/a&gt;, worsening the workforce shortage just as an &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage"&gt;impending shortfall of primary care physicians&lt;/a&gt; looms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why pharmacy accessibility matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/21620f1e07c14d7f81adc4503faaf51e"&gt;increasing closure of community pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; has far-reaching consequences for millions of Americans. That’s because neighborhood pharmacies are one of the most accessible health care locations in the country, with &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(22)00233-3/fulltext"&gt;an estimated 90% of Americans living within 5 miles of one&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, research shows that “&lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.wittenauer/viz/shared/26FX3DRSG"&gt;pharmacy deserts&lt;/a&gt;” are more common in marginalized communities, where people need accessible health care the most. For example, people who live in pharmacy deserts are also &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/2/4/qxae035/7630415"&gt;more likely to have a disability&lt;/a&gt; that makes it hard or impossible to walk. Many of these areas are also classified as &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(21)00362-9/fulltext"&gt;medically underserved areas or health professional shortage areas&lt;/a&gt;. As pharmacy closures accelerate, America’s &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/health-disparities-29998"&gt;health disparities&lt;/a&gt; could get even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if your neighborhood pharmacy closes, what should you do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While convenience and location matter, you might want to consider other factors that can help you meet your health care needs. For example, some pharmacies have staff who speak your native language, independent pharmacy business owners may be active in your community, and many locations offer over-the-counter products like hormonal contraception, the overdose-reversal drug &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/naloxone-can-reverse-opioid-overdose-heres-why-you-might-need-some-at-home-or-in-your-bag-245365"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt; and hearing aids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also consider locations – especially corporate-owned pharmacies – that also offer urgent care or primary care services. In addition, &lt;a href="https://vaccineconfident.pharmacist.com/"&gt;most pharmacies offer vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, and some offer test-and-treat services for infectious diseases, diabetes education and help with quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What to ask if your pharmacy closes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your preferred pharmacy closes and you need to find another one, keep the following questions in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;What will happen to your old prescriptions?&lt;/strong&gt; When a pharmacy closes, another pharmacy may buy its prescriptions. Ask your pharmacist if your prescriptions will be automatically transferred to a nearby pharmacy, and when this will occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;What’s the staffing situation like at other pharmacies?&lt;/strong&gt; This is an important factor in choosing a new pharmacy. What are the wait times? Can the team accommodate special situations like emergency refills or early refills before vacations? Does the pharmacist have a relationship with your primary care physician and your other prescribers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Which pharmacies accept your insurance?&lt;/strong&gt; A simple call to your insurer can help you understand where your prescriptions are covered at the lowest cost. And if you take a medication that’s not covered by insurance, or if you’re uninsured, you should ask if the pharmacy can help you by offering member pricing or manufacturer coupons and discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;What are your accessibility needs?&lt;/strong&gt; Pharmacies often offer services to make your care more accessible and convenient. These may include medication packaging services, drive-thru windows and home delivery. And if you’re considering switching to a mail-order pharmacy, you should ask if it has a pharmacist to answer questions by phone or during telehealth visits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that it’s best to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy chain or location so that your pharmacist can perform a safety check with your complete medication list. Drug interactions &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/drug-interactions-understanding-risk"&gt;can be dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community pharmacies have been staples of neighborhoods for more than a century. Unfortunately, current trends in pharmacy closures pose real threats to public health. We hope lawmakers address the underlying systemic issues so more Americans don’t lose access to their medications, health services and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But, juicing is a controversial practice, and many nutritionists recommend against it. Now, new research suggests that juice cleanses may harm your gut microbiome and boost &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/458" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that doing a juice cleanse for even a short period of time can throw your gut health out of whack. That could potentially have a big impact on your digestive and cognitive health, the researchers said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, R.D., is co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., is the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.63740323%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gwdocs.com/profile/marie-borum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marie Borum, M.D., M.P.H;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marie Borum, M.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;., director of the division of gastroenterology at George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates; &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what nutritionists want you to know about juice cleanses and their effect on the body, plus why most experts are strongly against this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small study recruited 14 people and had them follow one of three diets for three days: an all-juice diet, a diet of juice and food, or a plant-based diet. The participants gave stool, saliva, and inner-cheek samples before and after going on the diets, as well as 14 days after they finished the diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that people on the juice diet had “abundances” of inflammatory bacteria, which they linked to the high sugar, low fiber nature of the juice diet. Bacteria linked with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8427160/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut permeability;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut permeability&lt;/a&gt; (the ability of the intestine’s lining to control what passes through into the bloodstream), inflammation, and cognitive decline also increased in the juice diet group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that short-term juice consumption may negatively affect the microbiota,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritionists we spoke with say they’re not shocked by what the study found. “These findings add to the growing evidence that short-term dietary interventions can significantly impact the microbiome,” says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gwdocs.com/profile/marie-borum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marie Borum, M.D., M.P.H;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marie Borum, M.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;., director of the division of gastroenterology at George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, points out that this is a small study, which makes it hard to draw huge conclusions. “Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that importance of understanding the nutrient content of juices and prioritizing fiber intake in the diet,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might a juice cleanse negatively impact the gut?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few potential reasons for this. “When you eat fruits and vegetables, you get fiber—which is great,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.63740323%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “But when you juice those foods, you miss out on the fiber for the most part. What’s left is primarily sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-sugar, low-fiber diet is “not a beneficial thing for health, including gut health,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juicing also removes insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to stool and helps keep digestion regular, Keatley points out. Insoluble fiber “is essential for feeding beneficial gut bacteria and maintaining gut integrity,” he explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The absence of fiber can lead to an increased abundance of bacteria that thrive on simple sugars, such as &lt;em&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, which are associated with inflammation,” Keatley continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the gut microbiome, it’s important to consider the types and amounts of bacteria that thrive under healthy conditions, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N&lt;/a&gt;., professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University. “Beneficial gut bacteria rely on prebiotics and fiber—compounds indigestible by the human digestive tract—as their primary food source. Juice-only diets eliminate these crucial components, depriving these bacteria of essential nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that sugar from juices can also fuel microbial populations that aren’t as good for you, he says. “Your gut microbiota is the ultimate ‘survival of the fittest,’ and it really becomes a mirror of whatever you eat,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are juice cleanses healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, juicing is not considered healthy. “I’ve been begging people not to do juice cleanses for 12 years,” Cording says. She calls the promise of fast weight loss and helping your body to detox “alluring,” but says results from juice cleanses are not what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People lose weight when they do a juice cleanse because they’re eating less and peeing a lot, and they may even have more bowel movements,” she says. “But the weight they lose is mostly water weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only may juice cleanses interfere with your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with digestion and contributes to your immune system, Cording says that these are “terrible for your blood sugar,” because they can cause spikes and crashes. If you regularly experience blood sugar spikes and crashes, you could be at risk for developing a condition known as &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is a precursor to developing type 2 diabetes, Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bodily inflammation is also a big concern. “This has been linked to chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders,” Keatley says. “While a three-day juice diet may not cause lasting harm in healthy individuals, repeated or prolonged juice fasting could have cumulative negative effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to consider instead of a juice cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keatley warns against using juicing as a main dietary strategy. “For those who enjoy fresh juice, pairing it with fiber-rich foods like nuts, seeds, or whole grains can help slow glucose absorption and support gut health,” he says. “But just eating the fruits and vegetables—even if it’s less than when you juice—is the best option.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to have juice, Dr. Borum suggests pairing it with whole foods. This “can balance the intestinal microbiome,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cording stresses that actual fruits and vegetables are still better for you. “Instead of a juice cleanse, consider how you might incorporate more nutrient-dense produce into your day and pair it with good, quality protein sources and healthy fat.

In studies using mice and human brain tissue, these nanoparticles successfully delivered therapeutic mRNA, opening doors for potential treatments for neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS, and brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional drug delivery methods, this system utilizes natural transport mechanisms to penetrate the barrier safely and efficiently. The leading formulation, MK16 BLNP, showed superior mRNA delivery compared to FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Delivery System:&lt;/strong&gt; Newly designed lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) enable mRNA to bypass the blood-brain barrier, overcoming a major hurdle in treating brain disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Multiple Diseases:&lt;/strong&gt; The system could be adapted for neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain cancers by instructing brain cells to produce therapeutic proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superior Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; The MK16 BLNP formulation demonstrated significantly higher mRNA delivery efficiency compared to existing FDA-approved nanoparticles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have developed a lipid nanoparticle system capable of delivering messenger RNA (mRNA) to the brain via intravenous injection, a challenge that has long been limited by the protective nature of the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, in mouse models and isolated human brain tissue, were published in the February 17 online issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107840"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/bbb-mrna-nanoparticles-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team designed and tested a library of lipids to optimize their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They demonstrate the potential of this technology to pave the way for future treatments for a wide range of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain cancer, and drug addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier serves as a protective shield, preventing many substances—including potentially beneficial therapies—from reaching the brain. While previous research from Mount Sinai introduced a platform for transporting large biomolecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides into the central nervous system, this new study focuses on a different approach: using specially designed lipid nanoparticles to transport mRNA across the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting mRNA into the brain could allow scientists to instruct brain cells to produce therapeutic proteins that can help treat or prevent disease by replacing missing proteins, reducing harmful ones, or activating the body’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that these blood-brain barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) can safely and efficiently deliver mRNA into the brain,” says co-corresponding senior author Yizhou Dong, PhD, Professor of Immunology and Immunotherapy, and a member of the Icahn Genomics Institute and the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could open up opportunities to use mRNA-based therapies for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team designed and tested a library of lipids to optimize their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Through a series of structural and functional analyses, they identified a lead formulation, termed MK16 BLNP, that exhibited significantly higher mRNA delivery efficiency than existing lipid nanoparticles approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This system takes advantage of natural transport mechanisms within the blood-brain barrier, including caveolae- and γ-secretase-mediated transcytosis, to move nanoparticles across the barrier, say the investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies using mouse models of disease, the BLNP platform successfully delivered therapeutic mRNAs to the brain, demonstrating its potential for clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lipid nanoparticle system represents an important step in the effort to develop mRNA-based treatments for central nervous system disorders,” says Dr. Dong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study provides proof of concept that such an approach is viable and could be adapted for a range of diseases where gene therapy or mRNA therapeutics might play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that additional studies are needed to assess long-term safety and efficacy, including toxicology studies in accordance with FDA guidelines. Future research will focus on refining the technology for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the potential of lipid nanoparticles in overcoming one of the major challenges in treating brain diseases,” says co-corresponding senior author Eric J. Nestler, MD, PhD, Director of The Friedman Brain Institute, Dean for Academic Affairs, and Nash Family Professor in the Nash Family Department of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Chief Scientific Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are very excited to continue evaluating this novel platform for broader therapeutic applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled “Blood–brain-barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery to the central nervous system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors, as listed in the journal, are Chang Wang, Yonger Xue, Tamara Markovic, Haoyuan Li, Siyu Wang, Yichen Zhong, Shi Du, Yuebao Zhang, Xucheng Hou, Yang Yu, Zhengwei Liu, Meng Tian, Diana D.

Moreover, these nanoparticles can deliver mRNA to human brain ex vivo samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to neurons and astrocytes in broad brain regions, thereby being a promising platform to treat a range of central nervous system diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:14:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1OUTcxUDhPWUhjMXFiWlNDcTY0NzVyQ2dDSUItVDNiNmFzbnE4NTBfeDBfUF9ReEZIZzJnM2xOaFREbXFTUGlXc3YxaEdXLTQ3cjhPY29UelJYUjR2UWJXamNFUFZOaVZiVVE</guid></item><item><title>I spotted unusual sign of deadliest type of cancer early - it means I've lived 7 years longer than I should ha - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-one has left doctors 'gobsmacked' with her astonishing &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-bd84f2d0-edf2-11ef-9ca9-67171e429089"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; survival — she's lived with the deadliest type of brain tumour for over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glioblastomas, which usually kill within 18 months, are extremely aggressive and often untreatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well-known victims of the disease include Labour MP Tessa Jowell, who died just a year after diagnosis, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/the-wanted/index.html" id="mol-bd9bd630-edf2-11ef-9ca9-67171e429089"&gt;The Wanted&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/tom-parker/index.html" id="mol-bd7dedf0-edf2-11ef-9ca9-67171e429089"&gt;Tom Parker&lt;/a&gt;, who lost his life aged 33, less than 18 months after doctors spotted his tumour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 32, Jade Collett, from Worcestershire, believes her extraordinary survival is partly due to the fact her disease was spotted early, thanks to an unusual symptom that struck her during a night out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A decade a go, aged 22, she was enjoying an evening with friends when she noticed a change in the way she walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her foot was bent, causing her toes to point outwards, towards the right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time her friends laughed off the incident and assumed she was just too drunk — but she developed pain in her foot that eventually became agonising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She visited her GP the following day who sent her for an MRI scan and further testing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jade Collett (pictured with her daughter Grace who is now 10) was only 22 when her foot 'bent outwards' on a night out.

It didn't cross my mind that it could be something sinister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we walked into town, it was hurting but a few hours in I couldn't even put my foot on the ground it was hurting that much.

Grace wasn't even one yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only thing I thought about was Grace. I asked how long I had, and the doctor told me two years max. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They said it's inoperable because if they attempted to remove it, I would be disabled. They would give me treatment, but it was just to keep me stable and prolong my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy soon after her diagnosis and, so far, hasn't needed to undergo further rounds of treatment to keep her tumour at bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although her foot is still bent, she continues to defy doctors' two-year prognosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors' 'cannot explain' why her tumour has remained the same size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I found it hard going past the second year because I felt like I was waiting around to die. I felt like I couldn't plan ahead and was in limbo,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've got a will and had a whole funeral planned, it's all ready. I never thought I'd have to plan my own funeral at 22. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I've always wanted to keep going for Grace.

Now, emerging research suggests it may also play a role in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people aged 50 and older.

With dementia cases projected to rise alongside an aging global population, identifying new risk factors could be crucial for developing effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, the team analyzed health records spanning more than three decades, from 1988 to 2019. Their dataset included medical histories from over four million individuals aged 50 and older in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/quitting-smoking-at-any-age-returns-immediate-health-benefits-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. This extensive pool of data allowed them to examine patterns between H. pylori infections and Alzheimer’s onset with unprecedented depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings contribute to a growing body of research exploring how infections might trigger or accelerate neurodegenerative diseases. If a connection between &lt;strong&gt;H. pylori and Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt; is confirmed through further studies, it could lead to new strategies for prevention—possibly by targeting the bacterium with early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings were significant: individuals with symptomatic H. pylori infections faced an 11% higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s, the most common form of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-uncover-surprising-link-between-sitting-and-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. While the exact cause of Alzheimer’s remains complex and multifaceted, these results contribute to a growing body of evidence that suggests infections, particularly H. pylori, may play a crucial role in its development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="implications_and_future_directions"&gt;Implications and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research are vast. With the global &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-hypertension-drug-slows-down-aging-and-can-increase-lifespan-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;population aging&lt;/a&gt;, the prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s, is expected to triple over the next 40 years. Dr. Brassard emphasized the urgent need for effective treatment and preventive strategies to address this impending healthcare crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant aspects of the study is its potential to influence future preventive measures. Dr. Brassard pointed out that the role of H. pylori in dementia could be crucial in developing prevention strategies. He suggested that individualized eradication programs to reduce H. pylori infections could be a vital step in combating Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, affects approximately 40 million people worldwide.

It has opened new avenues for further investigation into the role of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/sugar-crucially-linked-to-the-prevention-and-cure-of-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;H. pylori in Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;. Several key areas are now poised for exploration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 heading css-1i7gs84" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_mechanisms"&gt;Understanding Mechanisms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which H. pylori may contribute to Alzheimer’s is essential. By identifying specific pathways, scientists could develop targeted treatments or preventive measures to mitigate the bacterium’s impact on &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-cholesterol-medication-slows-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease-helping-millions-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 heading css-1i7gs84" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="eradication_programs"&gt;Eradication Programs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of individualized eradication programs to reduce H. pylori infections is another critical area of research. These programs might involve screening and treating individuals with H. pylori infections, particularly in older adults, to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/traditional-chinese-herb-can-protect-the-brain-from-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower their risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 heading css-1i7gs84" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="population_level_interventions"&gt;Population-Level Interventions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader implications of this research suggest the need for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fewer-teens-view-themselves-as-overweight-and-that-s-a-public-health-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; interventions. Governments and healthcare organizations might consider implementing widespread efforts to reduce H. pylori infections. Such initiatives could potentially impact Alzheimer’s rates at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 heading css-1i7gs84" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="early_detection"&gt;Early Detection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting H. pylori infections early in life and monitoring their long-term effects on &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-discovery-reverses-signs-of-aging-boosts-brain-health-and-cuts-inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; could provide valuable insights into Alzheimer’s risk.

Then our medical doctor and registered nurse distribute the medicine through a shot—it’s all intramuscular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If it’s your first time using ketamine and you’re nervous about it, thank God! That’s the way it should be. But there’s also the option to not do ketamine at all: You thought you wanted to do it, and then when push comes to shove, you’re on your journey mat and you’re just like, “I really don’t want to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ketamine and psychedelics are not a panacea. We know that it’s not for everyone. You don’t have to push yourself to do this new, innovative, cutting-edge type of therapy. Yes, there is great promise, and the data over and over again makes this area very frothy and enthusiastic. But it’s perfectly OK if you’re scared and anxious. Just listen to your body and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; When we transition into the journey, we pull the BackJacks out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty sweet. They have little nests, little beds. They’re all tucked in. They have blankets and pillows, and earplugs if the ambient music playing on the speakers gets too loud. They’re wearing eye masks, because ketamine is more of a dissociative medicine—there is this sense of naturally going inward and being quiet. There are a bunch of stuffed animals there that some people take for their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s this huge teddy bear holding a cup of the intramuscular ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;We encourage clients to bring things that are meaningful for them—like a journal, photos of loved ones, loved ones that have passed, rocks. It’s just really loving, grounding, and open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;  It’s like an executive-coaching psychedelic slumber party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On the first day we do a psycholytic dose of ketamine. It’s not exactly a psychedelic dose, but it lets you kind of just teeter onto the realms. The next day is a mid-dose. That day is all about medicine and integration, and there’s coaching around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Four of us facilitate the off-sites. While people are on their ketamine journey, we’re all very attentive. We’re in silent communication with each other. Collectively, we’re really holding this space, seeing what emerges. I mean, we’ve seen over 100 ketamine journeys at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt; In a supportive clinical setting, the chance of having a bad trip is severely diminished. Also, I hold the faith that there’s no such thing as a bad trip. Rather, there are challenging or uncomfortable journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Let’s say someone’s trauma comes through. One way that could show up is you are screaming, or a lot of energy is just ripping through your body. You’ll get off your mat and you’ll just want to run. You’ll think you’re in a dangerous situation. The first thing we do is make sure you’re in a safe hold so that you feel cared for. We’ll let you take your eye mask off. Some people need a handhold or would like to be walked around the room. All these things help bring you back to now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The third day is all integration and coaching: “What does this mean for me? How did I feel? And how do I bring something positive from that journey into my everyday life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; And about a week and a half after, we have a follow-up virtual integration session, focused on the application of what they’ve learned to their leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;  One person came in not being able to feel their body. “I’m just a head, and this is my meat sack,” basically is what they said. After the off-site, they were able to pinpoint, “Actually, I feel like I can feel my chest. I can go to other places inside my body and be connected to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; People are floating away at the end. They’re like, “I don’t want this to end. Can I integrate this way of being into my life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—As told to Elana Klein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOa28tcWloZklXVkZxOWhrdFZvTWJvaFRBQnN0dHFDTEV3YUxDUVdyMEhSa2Z4WUFnWHd4ZVFUTC1kak5EbC0tRWlXVW1wYXhxRHhtOFZtMXNmYjkyZW9LNVBZVTNSbE8yMTZuTlkxR2t0Z04ya25IOXdXVU02ZFJuUm5DdGJrN21F</guid></item><item><title>Thanks to norovirus, there's a whole lotta poopin' goin' on - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPbEw0bmRLX3FpcXRxVlpPeU5IU0VwSnZoQXRXZnZLaDQ3OHQ5cTRTZlZzMktoSGtNU09lbHhWNzRUajJVVGhJNS1QbmlPcUJmZ09GRlBNWEhQU0VrUlpnQXhHYmwxSk5VRi03SDhpYVpkRjFJa1F1N2VvVndESEdNaGdhQk8xQ3B1RjJzRUVvQmY5RklvV2tpdkZ30gGfAUFVX3lxTFBFaFVvS244Qkl2TDZWSE1DQUZ1T2NWOGtEcHpYM3NxRzhoc2lpanI1TUlvZVRRLVMtUTktR3A2b2RIRlRfZnpPbWRGQ2dfUjhEOU56VDVFbjZhd0RLWUhJTVRLbHZnREhNSFIyTnYteGRCLWJnQWNHRzF4SUtVbTdMTTJqbGpOQ3JyMkdLcmpCSXlxMWdTS0VVSFM4ODlBWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:26:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPbEw0bmRLX3FpcXRxVlpPeU5IU0VwSnZoQXRXZnZLaDQ3OHQ5cTRTZlZzMktoSGtNU09lbHhWNzRUajJVVGhJNS1QbmlPcUJmZ09GRlBNWEhQU0VrUlpnQXhHYmwxSk5VRi03SDhpYVpkRjFJa1F1N2VvVndESEdNaGdhQk8xQ3B1RjJzRUVvQmY5RklvV2tpdkZ30gGfAUFVX3lxTFBFaFVvS244Qkl2TDZWSE1DQUZ1T2NWOGtEcHpYM3NxRzhoc2lpanI1TUlvZVRRLVMtUTktR3A2b2RIRlRfZnpPbWRGQ2dfUjhEOU56VDVFbjZhd0RLWUhJTVRLbHZnREhNSFIyTnYteGRCLWJnQWNHRzF4SUtVbTdMTTJqbGpOQ3JyMkdLcmpCSXlxMWdTS0VVSFM4ODlBWQ</guid></item><item><title>Thanks to norovirus, there's a whole lotta poopin' goin' on - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPbEw0bmRLX3FpcXRxVlpPeU5IU0VwSnZoQXRXZnZLaDQ3OHQ5cTRTZlZzMktoSGtNU09lbHhWNzRUajJVVGhJNS1QbmlPcUJmZ09GRlBNWEhQU0VrUlpnQXhHYmwxSk5VRi03SDhpYVpkRjFJa1F1N2VvVndESEdNaGdhQk8xQ3B1RjJzRUVvQmY5RklvV2tpdkZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:26:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPbEw0bmRLX3FpcXRxVlpPeU5IU0VwSnZoQXRXZnZLaDQ3OHQ5cTRTZlZzMktoSGtNU09lbHhWNzRUajJVVGhJNS1QbmlPcUJmZ09GRlBNWEhQU0VrUlpnQXhHYmwxSk5VRi03SDhpYVpkRjFJa1F1N2VvVndESEdNaGdhQk8xQ3B1RjJzRUVvQmY5RklvV2tpdkZ3</guid></item><item><title>Trump Admin Shifting Away From Depopulation for Bird Flu - Farm Policy News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPN0ZyMnlYRk1LbEpwUm1nZ2xkRndPSnF1QXVKTUdkVUFqbkUyWThMMUlqS0YwSWpPaVJRM1ZaVXhEc1p6cHhjcExLcXlhVU01d3k3OWlvVmhHODJZV21yMnJPVVpmd3VPWUdpZ2gxcUI3bGVWbktPaGNRbllhZHlkdWR6VC1MU0FaQW00X2dadWVkZy1qU2VDVXUteVgxaGNieVlV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single-blog-content entry wpex-mt-20 wpex-mb-40 wpex-clr" itemprop="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/22391-trump-administration-to-release-avian-flu-plan-shift-away-from-depopulating-farms"&gt;Agri-Pulse’s Philip Brasher reported Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;strong&gt;the Trump administration is preparing a plan for combatting avian flu that will move away from depopulating entire infected flocks and rely instead on ‘biosecurity and medication’ to contain outbreaks, says President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CBS’ Face the Nation Sunday that he has been working on the plan with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and ‘all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world,'” Brasher reported. “…USDA has for years been requiring the depopulation of infected flocks to control the spread of the virus, a requirement that has contributed to skyrocketing prices for eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘The Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken,’ Hassett said,” according to Brasher’s reporting. “‘And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn’t have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we’re working on,’ Hassett said.”&lt;/p&gt;

Most of those infections have been among farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cows,” Reuters reported. “…Zoetis, which deals with vaccines, medicines as well as diagnostic solutions for animals, said the conditional license was granted based on safety and reasonable expectation of efficacy. A conditional approval, called a conditional license, is used for emergencies, limited market availability, or other special circumstance and is issued for a finite period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last month, USDA said it would rebuild a stockpile of bird flu vaccines for poultry that match the strain of the virus circulating in commercial flocks and wild birds,” Reuters reported. “The U.S. had built a poultry vaccine stockpile after major bird flu outbreaks in 2014 and 2015, though they were never used.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Separately, Moderna is developing a bird flu vaccine for humans and has received about $766 million from the U.S. government for its advancement,” Reuters reported. “The company said last month it was preparing to advance its experimental shot, mRNA-1018, into late-stage trials based on preliminary data from an early- to mid-stage study.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/22391-trump-administration-to-release-avian-flu-plan-shift-away-from-depopulating-farms"&gt;Brasher reported&lt;/a&gt; that “the United Egg Producers and National Turkey Federation wrote Rollins on Friday in support of using vaccines to control the virus. ‘It is imperative that a science-based surveillance strategy be developed in which infected animals can be distinguished from vaccinated animals, and that any validated, risk-based surveillance strategy must be agreed upon by our international trading partners,’ the letter said. The National Milk Producers Federation and International Dairy Foods Association also signed the letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Vaccine Use Could Negatively Affect Poultry Exports&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letter-to-USDA-Re-HPAI-Vaccine.pdf"&gt;The Congressional Chicken Caucus wrote to new Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins&lt;/a&gt;, however, saying that “to be clear, vaccination in any poultry sector – egg layers, turkeys, broilers, or ducks – will jeopardize the entire export market for all U.S. poultry products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem is that most U.S. trading partners do not recognize countries that vaccinate as ‘free of HPAI’ due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the virus,” the letter said. “Therefore, U.S. trading partners do not accept exports from countries that vaccinate, either for specific product categories, regions that vaccinate, or for all poultry from the country. In other words, if an egg-laying hen in Michigan is vaccinated for HPAI, it’s unclear to the rest of the U.S. poultry industry whether our trading partners would accept an unvaccinated broiler chicken from Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter says that U.S. broiler producers export more than 15% of production, at a value of nearly $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You can start out as an average walker, and over time, speed up the strides on your daily neighborhood route. This helps to create aerobic activity, improve your heart health and build up endurance while burning calories, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/walking/art-20046261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you get started? Late winter and early spring are great times to pound the pavement, as temperatures are more mild and the ground is thawing in some parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips and tricks to get your walking routine underway:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. As few as &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:4,000 steps a day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;4,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; can decrease your risk of early death, according to recent research, according to the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Experts at the Mayo Clinic say walking also improves blood pressure and cardiovascular health, and can help control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. It also maintains weight and mobility, and can even help you lose a few pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Mentally, walking doesn’t just improve mood, it also helps maintain memory and cognitive function, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acefitness.org/about-ace/press-room/in-the-news/8287/walking-vs-running-which-form-of-cardio-has-better-health-benefits-sports-illustrated/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Council on Exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Council on Exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;four women walking outside on spring day&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started, try incorporating a 30-minute walk into your daily routine, either outside or on a treadmill. Build up with strength training over time. Even small amounts of activity adds up to benefit your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more intense workout, try walking uphill for longer periods of time, or up and down stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when you’re ready, you may even want to start to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MORE ON WEATHER.COM&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1Vc01nSzUxdWM2RG4zOXR3eWRURzN4Y1cxaEp1bVdyUm50TUk1aXY5Ty02YWpxY2VrRmpaZlRqRWl5dnRNcmM2YUdMeUZXbVJFbzV3d0RqQnJQRGJhYzV5VXpacXlVQXFNaGkwZFdXRFZFWnM2N0JfcA</guid></item><item><title>Oatzempic: should you try the weight-loss ‘miracle’ drink? - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPQXlTdkdEY2d6LWwtSVhWb01yazBxeTU3TmdFVTdvRXNLN0FuUjRtMXN2dlpaVnVIaDBRYmhNc2lZWnNWczZodFIxemlXV2xvQmczZkZmVDZwdXBsTnhPV0Z5b1R3QmJEUFBxWnVSNi10NDBmWHVXZzgtQkRwcVR3RUFJeXJ6MTRtS2ZJOERfMUV1MTZyN1czMUgtZ0c2R2ZxVy14aEgtUGZkMkhXZXpBeU1ONVcwSnZ5RmNLQzFvVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Oatzempic”, as the DIY drink is being dubbed, is made by blending half a glass of rolled oats, a glass of water, a dash of cinnamon and a squeeze of lime juice. As rudimentary and unlikely as it sounds, it has amassed a cult following, with 40 million views on TikTok as well as before-and-after posts on Instagram.

Of course not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Linia Patel, a registered dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, describes the craze as “madness”, and Rhiannon Lambert, a registered nutritionist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Science of Plant-Based Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;, says, “It’s a bizarre phenomenon and there’s nothing miraculous that’s going to come from drinking a glass of blended oats and water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Does ‘Oatzempic’ really work for weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, there is a kernel of scientific truth hidden in the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Oats are rich in soluble fibre, particularly beta-glucan, which forms a gel-like substance in the digestive tract that may then help to slow down your digestion,” Patel says. “This can lead to an increased feeling of fullness and satisfaction after eating. Oats can help regulate hunger and appetite, but they are by no means a miracle weight-loss aid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.8"&gt;&lt;div id="3a924a7c-b79f-454d-a0d5-be7b73d65a85"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Oats, water, lime juice and cinnamon — bizarre concoction or weight-loss miracle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As if a dubious viral weight-loss trend wasn’t enough to malign the reputation of the wholefood staple, there is also speculation about its heart-healthy reputation. The soluble fibre in oats has been linked to lower cholesterol and for years they have been recommended as part of a healthy diet, with the British Heart Foundation stating on its website that “porridge is our top choice for a heart-healthy breakfast”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, last year Dr Jack Wolfson, a certified cardiologist from Arizona who calls himself the “natural heart doctor”, questioned all this in videos he posted on social media that have attracted millions of views. In them he says that oatmeal (porridge to us in the UK) has “no nutritional value” and “contains a lot of anti-nutrients” that prevent our bodies from absorbing other vitamins and minerals. On his website he states that our hunter-gatherer ancestors “never ate oats” and that “if you want all the fibre and all the alleged benefits of oatmeal, just eat the box”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/a-week-trying-to-eat-30-plants-what-did-the-kids-think-3hv5g3tgh" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A week trying to eat 30 plants. What did the kids think?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Significant studies suggest otherwise, though. In 2016 a large review of 58 published papers in the BMJ reported that eating 3.5g a day of oat beta glucan fibre — equivalent to the amount in a bowl of porridge and a couple of oatcakes — lowered markers of cardiovascular disease. These included a 4.2 per cent reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol levels. And two years ago an analysis involving nearly 5,000 overweight people with raised cholesterol conducted by a team of European cardiologists concluded that an oat-eating habit resulted in better blood fat profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It is well documented that the consumption of beta-glucan within oats significantly reduces LDL cholesterol profiles,” Lambert says. “And since that is a determinant of someone’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease we can conclude that, for most of us, oats are good for our hearts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/food-drink/article/ozempic-social-life-friends-first-person-vcchwd7d9" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozempic is ruining my social life (and I’m not taking it)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oats have also come under fire for causing sugar spikes in those monitoring their blood sugar levels. But Dr Duane Mellor, a registered dietician and senior teaching fellow at Aston University medical school, says that anti-oat messages have no basis in science. It’s “a normal part of digestion” for blood sugar to rise after we eat carbohydrate-rich foods including oats, Mellor says, and they are classified as a medium glycaemic index (GI) food, meaning they are absorbed more slowly than white bread and refined cereals. Any food with a medium or low GI is thought to sustain appetite and reduce hunger pangs better than ultra-processed and high GI foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Most research overwhelmingly shows that oats are beneficial for our health in many ways,” Mellor says. “No food is perfect and no food is a magic bullet for health, but in general oats fit neatly into a well-balanced diet.” Here’s what they can (and can’t) do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Will eating oats help you to lose weight?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;With their medium GI and beta-glucan fibre content, “adding oats in your diet can help regulate hunger and appetite”, Patel says. Oats contain about 380 calories and about 7g of unsaturated fat per 100g, and a bowl of porridge made with 200ml of semi-skimmed milk provides about 280 calories, but the fibre means you are less likely to snack or overeat after consuming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One of the reasons people following the oatzempic trend may have lost weight is because they used the drink as a meal replacement and it filled them up. But you don’t need to blend oats into a drink to get the benefits — overnight oats, porridge and oatcakes will all bring benefits. A review of evidence in the journal Current Nutrition Reports last year found oat consumption to be beneficial for weight management and appetite control. That paper also highlighted oats as benefiting a healthy gut microbiome, which has been associated with weight loss and a reduced risk of obesity by other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Beta-glucans are also a prebiotic and support the ‘good’ bugs in your gut to grow,” Patel says. “There is more and more evidence showing that a healthy, diverse community of gut bugs not only help with better digestion but are involved in appetite control as well as hormone regulation and risk of diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Do oats contain ‘anti-nutrients’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So-called anti-nutrients are compounds naturally present in plant-based foods that reduce the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food. Oats do contain phytic acid, found in abundance in the bran part of the oat grain, which binds to minerals including zinc, magnesium, calcium and manganese, making it difficult for your body to absorb them. However, this is not problematic if you eat an otherwise healthy diet. Lambert says the health gains from oats being a medium GI and high-fibre wholegrain outweigh any potential effects of nutrient malabsorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“As oats are not a natural source of these micronutrients, there is less of a reason to worry about this inhibition,” Lambert says. “A top tip is to pair your bowl of oats or granola with a fresh orange, as the vitamin C found in oranges is known to aid iron absorption and therefore cancels out the effect of the phytic acid.” You can also try soaking oats overnight, which reduces anti-nutrient levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Is oat milk a healthy option?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unless you opt for oat milk because you have a cow’s milk or lactose intolerance, choosing an oat milk latte may have fewer health benefits than you think. Commercial oat milks are made from the liquid left when oats are soaked in water. They can be highly processed and some are sweetened. All are lower in protein than cow’s milk. While oat milk does contain some fibre, it is not in impressive amounts. An average serving of a commercial oat milk provides two grams of fibre, less than 10 per cent of the daily requirement for adults (30g). Lambert suggests you look for an oat milk that is fortified with iodine, calcium and, preferably, vitamin B12 and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Are some oats better for you than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Instant porridge pots and sachets are more highly processed and some contain high levels of added sugar, which cause more pronounced blood sugar spikes. Coarse, jumbo or steel-cut oats (also known as Irish oats) are minimally processed and have a slightly lower glycaemic index than rolled oats, so will have less impact on blood sugar levels. The addition of a little fat or protein will cause a less dramatic rise and fall in blood glucose levels, keeping you feeling fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“In my clinical practice I find that many people begin the day with a low protein intake,” Patel says. “Since protein also has a positive impact on glycaemic index, if you opt for oats in the morning make sure you take them with milk, some nuts or seeds, or stir in some Greek yoghurt or even an egg to boost the overall protein content of your breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It is worth paying extra for organic oat products. “They typically will have much lower glyphosate contaminates from herbicides put on the crop to kill weeds,” Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Are oats gluten-free?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;According to the NHS, oats do not contain gluten. However, they are often avoided by people with coeliac disease, a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues when gluten is consumed. This avoidance is largely because oats are often produced in the same factories as wheat, barley and rye, which carries a risk of gluten contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oats do contain avenin, a protein similar to gluten, and according to the charity Coeliac UK this can cause sensitivities in a small percentage of people with the condition. For most people with a non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, choosing gluten-free oats is an option, although you will need to check labels carefully. Oat products described as “gluten-free” will have passed tests to prove they contain 20 parts per million or less of gluten, and thus meet the UK’s legal standards for gluten-free labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPQXlTdkdEY2d6LWwtSVhWb01yazBxeTU3TmdFVTdvRXNLN0FuUjRtMXN2dlpaVnVIaDBRYmhNc2lZWnNWczZodFIxemlXV2xvQmczZkZmVDZwdXBsTnhPV0Z5b1R3QmJEUFBxWnVSNi10NDBmWHVXZzgtQkRwcVR3RUFJeXJ6MTRtS2ZJOERfMUV1MTZyN1czMUgtZ0c2R2ZxVy14aEgtUGZkMkhXZXpBeU1ONVcwSnZ5RmNLQzFvVQ</guid></item><item><title>Genes, income and health: Unraveling the complex connections - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOeWk5dzJTQzl4bWFYLXlhRW44ejdaUlRWMTlNX0RsSWFXUjBXWFJlekYtT2FhcWM4a3BfMDlRYndCYlZ4X1lrellkWUJ5QXBiNmVJeDNnTVdDX3VVaUMyZE03aHQtblFnMHY2SFh6b3dzMmpKUjJnMzJqa2JnOTA4eE9Xd011Qlhsd1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research studies have consistently found that there are disparities in the health outcomes of people from different socio-economic backgrounds. More recently, some findings hinted at the possibility that genetics also play a role in the widely documented relationship between health and income.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Uppsala University, University of Edinburgh and other institutes worldwide recently carried out a study aimed at further exploring the connection between genetic variants and income. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02080-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that while the effects of genetics on income and health are small, they are significant and observed in populations from various European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are many reasons to be interested in the relationship between our genome and our income, and how that relates to differences in health, and these reasons will vary between co-authors of this study," Abdel Abdellaoui, W. David Hill and Philipp D. Koellinger, co-authors of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "There is much interest in the relationship between socio-economic status and health in many different fields of research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much people earn is known to significantly impact their quality of life, broadening or limiting the services and opportunities available to them. For instance, in many countries, a larger income could allow individuals to send their children to private schools or enroll for higher education courses, as well as pay for specialist and private health care services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While previous research has established strong associations between income and various life outcomes, we wanted to explore the extent to which and how genetic factors relate to these associations," said Abdellaoui, Hill and Koellinger.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This will teach us about how our socio-economic system interacts with our biological make-up, will inform research on the relationship between biology and disease, and can help us better understand how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/social+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;social factors&lt;/a&gt; and health influence each other."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic data&lt;/a&gt; collected from 668,288 individuals across 12 countries, primarily in Europe, which was stored in various large-scale biobanks or gathered as part of earlier cohort studies. The researchers estimated the associations between these individuals' genetic variants and their income, also examining how both are linked to health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using family data, we examined how much these genetic associations are influenced by the family environment, which can make genetic effects appear larger than they are," explained Abdellaoui, Hill and Koellinger. "We already knew that genetic associations with income closely resemble those with educational attainment, so we used statistical techniques to separate the two and examine their distinct relationships with (mental) health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the analyses carried out by the researchers showed that environmental factors influence the difference in income observed among the populations they studied. In fact, while the team found that genetic factors explained approximately 1%–5% of variations in income, most of the predictive power of genetic variants appeared to arise from indirect effects, such as the background of parents and other environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Only about a quarter of the genetic influences on income seem to be from direct genetic effects, meaning that most of the observed genetic associations are shaped by social and environmental contexts," said Abdellaoui, Hill and Koellinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Second, we found evidence that some of the genetic effects that act on income in one country are different from the genetic effects that act on income in other countries. This suggests that social and economic structures influence how genetic predispositions manifest and that the traits and skills that contribute to income may differ between the countries studied."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers observed that the association between genetic variants and income also extended to education. Yet when they removed genetic effects that were shared between income and education, the remaining genetic factors (only linked to income) were found to be associated with better mental health outcomes and an engagement in risky behaviors, such as smoking or drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Plans for future research will vary between authors of this study, but an important direction for the field is to better map the relationships between genetics, socio-&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/economic+status/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;economic status&lt;/a&gt;, and health outcomes across different societies and over time," said Abdellaoui, Hill and Koellinger. "We expect these relationships to vary depending on social structures, policies, and historical contexts."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This recent work offers new, interesting insights about the intricate link between genetics and income, education, and health. In their next studies, the team would like to broaden their research, examining more diverse datasets that reach beyond European populations, as this could help to determine how the effects that they observed vary on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further work is also needed to disentangle genetic effects from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+influences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental influences&lt;/a&gt; and to explore the mechanisms through which socio-economic factors influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; disparities," added the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Additionally, income is just one aspect of the broader concept of socioeconomic status (SES). As such, it is important to understand how specific these genetic associations are to income or if they act across indices of SES. This is currently the focus of one project carried out by Hill and Koellinger."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six o’clock, TV hour, don’t get caught in foreign tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY"&gt;REM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: I wrote the first draft of this about two weeks ago. It looked bad then. Since? Holy cannoli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sigh. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men"&gt;Not with a bang but a whimper&lt;/a&gt;. This is my whimper for the month. I had other ideas for the blog. There is an acupuncture post I thought about doing. Two on chiropractic, but I suppose the one on chiropractic and the Senate is a non-starter on basic principles. I will eventually get around to them but given the &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rapid_unplanned_disassembly"&gt;rapid planned disassembly&lt;/a&gt; of the government, the topics seemed so trivial. Don’t get me wrong. I enjoy writing on the usual &lt;abbr title="So-Called Complementary and Alternative Medicine"&gt;SCAM&lt;/abbr&gt; topics. So eventually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sports metaphors are always popular, so here is mine. Right now, if the medically oriented federal organizations such as the NIH or CDC were an NBA team, they are filling their roster and coaching staff with, well, people like me. Short, weak, uncoordinated, slow and with only a trivial understanding of the details of the games. Put that team on the court and it will not go well. Although, such a team could &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/standings"&gt;perhaps beat the Wizards&lt;/a&gt;. But I do not think the current appointments are going to be able to handle a resurgence of long controlled and mostly forgotten infectious diseases. But not forgotten by me. It was my job for 40 years to think about infections, a mindset that made me popular at parties. “Hey, did you know you could get &lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt; from eating that?” and “Oh, that could be a sign of syphilis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My wife likes to say the best way to predict the future is to understand the past. &lt;a href="https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/those-who-cannot-remember-past-are-condemned-repeat-it-george-santayana-life-reason-1905"&gt;George Santayana had it wrong&lt;/a&gt;. People usually remember the past, incorrectly, preferring to ignore it or figure it doesn’t apply to them. So I thought it might be fun to try and guess what is going to happen in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-105530"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw a few of the vaccine-preventable diseases in my long and storied career. One case of tetanus in an elderly unvaccinated SE Asian immigrant. Ever had a muscle cramp? Hurt like hell, didn’t it? Now imagine every muscle cramping at once and not stopping. Awful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw one case of paralytic polio 40 years ago, again an immigrant who never received the vaccine. Lots of chickenpox over the years. A couple fatal cases in pregnancy, an awful complication, and the occasional necrotizing fasciitis complicating chickenpox, again in the unvaccinated. One case of mumps in a middle-aged unvaccinated truck driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I never saw a case of whooping cough, diphtheria or measles, in part because I was an adult infectious disease doctor and all the children were cared for at the pediatric hospital, and in part due to the rarity of the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Couple cases of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;influenzae&lt;/em&gt; b meningitis in young adults. They died. Bad disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw lots of pneumococcal disease early on in my practice and all the odd manifestations of that organism: meningitis, heart valve infections and even a couple rare cases of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6904394/"&gt;hemolytic uremic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6956486/"&gt;Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&lt;/a&gt; syndrome. They died as well. But thanks to childhood vaccination, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39435466/"&gt;adult pneumococcal disease&lt;/a&gt;, along with antibiotic resistance (temporarily), went away. The importance of immunizing the vector/source of infection,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal disease also disappeared in the second half of my practice. There is a disease that can kill and kill fast from sepsis and meningitis. Fine at breakfast, dead by dinner. Glad it was mostly gone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awful diseases and rare complications are, if you are a clinician and temporarily turn off the empathetic/sympathetic parts of the brain, intellectually really cool. I have said that infectious disease is kind of like birding, only interesting in that you have a life list of all the odd infections you have seen. Unlike birders, I don’t want to complete the list. I don’t want to see a case of measles or whooping cough or smallpox. I am quite satisfied with the historical descriptions. Unfortunately, the best cases with the most interesting physiology and the deepest understanding of disease are the worst for the patients. You never want to be an interesting or great case for your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What to expect? Clinicians are going to have the opportunity to see a lot of interesting, great cases. And mores the pity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine preventable diseases will return. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5127422/whooping-cough-outbreak-u-s-seattle"&gt;pertussis aka whooping cough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7321a1.htm"&gt;chickenpox&lt;/a&gt; will lead the charge given how communicable they are. I always remembered my specialty was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;infectious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; diseases, with emphasis on infectious. The other vaccine preventable diseases, perhaps less so. But the number of infections will be small potatoes relative to the entire US population. Vast swathes of the country will still be immune and continue to get their vaccinations. The outbreaks will be confined to communities whose vaccination rates will run in the 80%. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/measles-texas-outbreak/index.html" title=""&gt;Like Texas.&lt;/a&gt; More cases in red counties if COVID is any example, although anti-vaccination knows no color. There will be dozens of children who will sicken, but, fortunately, rarely die. And it will be very expensive. In 2019, across the Columbia from Portland:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall societal cost of the 2019 Clark County measles outbreak was approximately $3.4 million ($47,479 per case or $814 per contact). The majority of the costs (≈$2.3 million) were incurred by the public health response to the outbreak, followed by productivity losses (≈$1.0 million), and direct medical costs (≈$76,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I suppose they are getting what they voted for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I expect there will be the reports from parents whose unvaccinated children died or had horrible complications imploring people to get vaccinated. That, like COVID testimonials, will do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I would bet against huge outbreaks of childhood diseases that will sweep the US. There will likely always be enough immunity that those diseases will fester along, causing morbidity and mortality in a relatively small population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huge outbreaks infecting millions will require a new pathogen where there is no preexisting immunity in the population or that has the bad combination of being both virulent and infectious, Hmm. Like bird flu could become. Look how we did with COVID when we had the best and brightest at the CDC. Moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there were issues with CDCs response to COVID. Armchair quarterbacking is easy. I was in charge of infection control for 6 hospitals for much of my career and knowing what to do with known diseases and a small outbreak was difficult. I cannot imagine trying to control a new/unknown infection for 350,000,000 plus people. It ain’t easy and the CDC has my sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the best and the brightest are being replaced by oh man, I don’t even have the adjectives. Starting at center, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_shortest_people" title=""&gt;Chandra Bahadur Dangi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when and if there is a new pandemic, if bird flu mutates or who knows what is lurking out there decides it’s dinner time and humans are now on the menu? Man, we are so toast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then there is AIDS. My career started with AIDS, remembering the association is not causation. I still remember my first patient, a twenty something male, dying of disseminated &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;avium&lt;/em&gt;, wasting away with fevers and intractable diarrhea. We did not know the cause of his disease, which made care a little anxiety provoking. I remember he told me he could spit in my mouth and not give me AIDS. Besides ick, how did he know? At autopsy he was more &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;avium&lt;/em&gt;, than human cells. It was an awful death, the first of many I saw in the following years. Everyone in medicine probably has the diseases they don’t want to die of. AIDS, ALS, and pancreatic cancer may be my top three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AIDS was the death no one wants. Slow, debilitating and often painful. And they could the bullet coming, Not the quick demise of a cardiac arrest we all hope for. And I saw lots of AIDS deaths before the amazing results of &lt;a href="https://www.positivelyaware.com/articles/25-years-haart"&gt;HAART&lt;/a&gt; now called ART. Much better than the Fairly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy that preceded it. Yes, I went there. You may be young once, but you can be immature all your life. Since around 2005 I had not had a single patient die of an AIDS-related infection. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was nice not to give people a fatal diagnosis. One of the least fun parts of the job is telling someone they have an illness that will likely kill them in the next year or so, there is nothing to be done about it, and you have seen the effects of the disease in many of your friends. The despair and anguish of patients and their loved ones are awful. And, in the US, mostly in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Africa? About 21 million people are alive because of AIDS medications, much of it supplied and managed by US dollars gleefully being cut off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one million people showing up in clinics being given a death sentence. 21 million people lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, with the anguish and despair of knowing they are going to die soon and unpleasantly. Mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and children are going to lose their loved ones. Babies will be infected in the womb and die young.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The amount of totally preventable suffering and death may be staggering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take time and it probably (I hope) will not happen at quite the scale of 21 million. Stop HAART and it takes a month for the HIV to rebound, 6-ish years to progress (all the while the patient is now infectious so spread increases) and kill. So some time to mitigate. But the deaths and suffering could be catastrophically huge. This one hit me hard, a pit of the stomach feeling of despair. Americans? For good or bad—well, mostly bad—we are getting what the majority voted for. Millions of those outside the US whose lives depend on us? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I recently heard, the willingness to inflict suffering and death is a feature, not a bug. It is a shame humans have never developed a philosophy of love your neighbor, peace and love (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ringostarrmusic/video/7117045001833565483?lang=en" title=""&gt;besides Ringo&lt;/a&gt;), and help the helpless. It would be nice for such a thing to exist. I dream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news in all this? The death and suffering in the next century from unopposed climate change will make even this look like a walk in the cemetery. At least I will be dead.&lt;/p&gt;

            There have been three days over the past month that my two children have both gone to school. By the time one of them recovers from the latest virus they’ve brought home, the other one is sick again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000g3b6mtiox5zli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I know many of you are going through the same experience. Doctors saw more &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/health/intense-flu-season/index.html"&gt;patients with flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; during the week ending February 1 than at any time in the last 15 years, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000h3b6m4obpilpf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For parents working outside the home, having kids home sick  is often a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000i3b6mwlo0y0u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many parents don’t have the option to work from home. That includes my husband, who is an emergency department doctor. He will often cover for colleagues when they ask him to switch shifts due to family emergencies. I try to say yes if we can make it work — even when it’s inconvenient for our family. That way, I hope they’ll do the same when our daughters are sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000j3b6mdvgd28sw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a professor, I’m often able to work remotely. But it isn’t easy to do so while caring for a sick child. Since I expect to be in this situation again, I reached out to experts to learn what parents can do to take care of their sick kids and themselves while working from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000k3b6mebmto7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kids who are sick benefit from regular contact and reassurance from their parents, said Dr. Michael Glazier, chief medical officer at Bluebird Kids Health, a Florida-based pediatric practice.  That’s hard to give them when parents must be in meetings or meet deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000l3b6m3x0hn1wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under such circumstances, “it is very helpful for kids to be given a schedule and reminded of the times when meetings occur and when parents will be back to check in,” he said via email.  “Often kids will also benefit from having a direct line of sight with their parents when their parents are at home but working.” That way, kids are reminded their parents are there for them.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000m3b6mhw3e7ajv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glazier also recommended giving kids “gentle activities that can preoccupy them and divert their attention away from their symptoms.” He suggested keeping a stash of new things on hand to pull out during sick days, such as Play-Doh, blocks and art activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000n3b6mu4jqdcvs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To stay sane, it’s a good idea for parents to remind themselves that the situation is temporary, said &lt;a href="https://thecounselaur.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lauren Tetenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based licensed clinical social worker who specializes in maternal mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000o3b6mza9c9hlc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Be gentle with yourself and accept that if today is a sick day for your kid, it likely won’t be your best day at work,” she said. “Health is truly the priority here, and if you wear yourself down trying to do everything at 100% and get sick yourself, you’ll have even more to worry about when it comes to balancing it all.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000p3b6mr3fdmkx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We also have to ask for help, Tetenbaum said. “It’s really important to build a system of supportive adults who can step in as needed, even if your kid may be spreading germs. That adult can be a paid babysitter, a family member or a neighbor or friend who will do you a favor that you will one day return.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000q3b6mdj1km9jj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tetenbaum, who is a mom of two elementary school-age kids, said it’s important “not (to) assume that one parent is always the default caregiver.” In most families, that’s the mom. “Couples must explicitly communicate about who can do what on certain days, even if one parent usually has a more flexible schedule,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000r3b6muybvumaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She also recommended that parents be compassionate with themselves. “You are doing your best,” she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000s3b6mukjylcc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For me, it means sometimes allowing my daughters to consume extra media content, such as YouTube videos or online content from PBS Kids, while making sure it’s appropriate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000t3b6mwuvnq4st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When kids return to school, Glazier said there are ways to try to prevent them from bringing the next virus home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000u3b6miuau406x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping up to date with vaccinations is important, he said. The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/influenza/#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics,can%20be%20used%20for%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that all kids over age 6 months get the flu vaccine unless they have medical reasons not to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000v3b6mev4x0vh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Making sure kids get good nutrition and enough sleep and exercise can also help keep their immune systems healthy. “A strong healthy immune system will help both prevent and minimize the effects of infections,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000w3b6mbj22333q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also suggested telling kids to wash their hands frequently, especially before they eat at school. They should wash for at least 20 seconds, he said, which is about how much time it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000x3b6mazhi2ngl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s not possible to do so at school before eating, they should use a hand sanitizer. (I stashed a small one in my daughter’s backpack.) A hand sanitizer can’t kill all germs, but it can help protect against many.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000y3b6mgd8ue2we@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also a good idea to send food to school that kids can eat with utensils, rather than with their hands, which could be full of germs, Glazier said. And he recommended telling kids not to share food with their friends. While hard to enforce, it’s another way to avoid the spread of germs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000z3b6muux7r4w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When many classmates are sick, it’s also a good idea to have kids wash their hands and change their clothes when they come home from school, even before giving them hugs, Glazier said. Doing so can help prevent them from making their parents sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz800103b6m4ekuh8h0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Taking care of a sick kid isn’t easy, especially when parents also have to work. But parents with the option to work remotely can be strategic about keeping our kids home when they’re sick and teaching them about hygiene for when they return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to live your dreams — especially when you can’t remember them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dream recall is the ability to summon at least some significant details from a dream once you wake up. &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remember-dreams-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Only 11% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; almost always remember their dreams — it’s a mystery why it’s easier for some than others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in Italy say they have identified the individual characteristics and external factors that can influence the odds of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Everyone dreams at night, but very few people remember the details of their dreams. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;phoenix021 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits and sleep dynamics interact,” said lead study author Giulio Bernardi, a professor in general psychology at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s a dream?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vivid dreams happen most often during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, when the brain is particularly active. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;StockPhotoPro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A dream is a sequence of images, thoughts, emotions and sensations that our mind generates while we sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171870/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;All of us dream every night.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/01/how-dreaming-makes-you-fitter-smarter-and-happier/"&gt;Dreaming is believed&lt;/a&gt; to help us process our emotions, store memories, strengthen our brain’s neural connections, reduce stress, solve problems and think creatively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/24/us-news/start-up-remspace-claims-to-have-successfully-achieved-first-chat-between-two-dreaming-humans-could-unlock-new-dimensions/"&gt;Vivid dreams&lt;/a&gt; happen most often during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, when the brain is particularly active.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people, especially women, said they were able to recall their dreams &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9132492/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more often during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273281" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers attributed&lt;/a&gt; to greater stress, depression and sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How did the study work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Study participants had to report daily for 15 days if they dreamed or not and to describe the dream if they did. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂ ÃÂµÃÂ³ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂ° Ãâ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂµÃÂµÃÂ²ÃÂ° – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The IMT research was conducted from 2020 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 200 participants, between 18 and 70, took psychological tests and answered questionnaires before and after the trial to determine their anxiety levels, their interest in dreams and their tendency to get distracted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were given a voice recorder to report daily for 15 days if they dreamed or not and to describe the dream if they did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each participant also wore an actigraph, a device that detects sleep duration, quality and disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Which factors increase the chances of better dream recall?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Younger people tend to be able to better recall their dreams, according to the new study. Researchers suggested there may be age-related changes in memory processes during sleep. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;chaiwattc – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers proposed that the people most likely to recall dreams:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a positive attitude about dreams&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Tend to let their minds wander&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spend longer periods of time in light sleep&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Live in warmer weather — participants reported lower dream recall during winter&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Are younger — older people often have “white dreams,” the vague sense of having dreamed without concrete evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness,” Bernardi said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Valentina Elce, an IMT researcher and first study author, said data collected in this project will allow the team to research unusual changes in dream patterns and their possible significance for predicting or identifying medical or psychological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

            There have been three days over the past month that my two children have both gone to school. By the time one of them recovers from the latest virus they’ve brought home, the other one is sick again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            I know many of you are going through the same experience. Doctors saw more &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/health/intense-flu-season/index.html"&gt;patients with flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; during the week ending February 1 than at any time in the last 15 years, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

            For parents working outside the home, having kids home sick  is often a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000i3b6mwlo0y0u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many parents don’t have the option to work from home. That includes my husband, who is an emergency department doctor. He will often cover for colleagues when they ask him to switch shifts due to family emergencies. I try to say yes if we can make it work — even when it’s inconvenient for our family. That way, I hope they’ll do the same when our daughters are sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000j3b6mdvgd28sw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a professor, I’m often able to work remotely. But it isn’t easy to do so while caring for a sick child. Since I expect to be in this situation again, I reached out to experts to learn what parents can do to take care of their sick kids and themselves while working from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000k3b6mebmto7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kids who are sick benefit from regular contact and reassurance from their parents, said Dr. Michael Glazier, chief medical officer at Bluebird Kids Health, a Florida-based pediatric practice.  That’s hard to give them when parents must be in meetings or meet deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000l3b6m3x0hn1wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under such circumstances, “it is very helpful for kids to be given a schedule and reminded of the times when meetings occur and when parents will be back to check in,” he said via email.  “Often kids will also benefit from having a direct line of sight with their parents when their parents are at home but working.” That way, kids are reminded their parents are there for them.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000m3b6mhw3e7ajv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glazier also recommended giving kids “gentle activities that can preoccupy them and divert their attention away from their symptoms.” He suggested keeping a stash of new things on hand to pull out during sick days, such as Play-Doh, blocks and art activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000n3b6mu4jqdcvs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To stay sane, it’s a good idea for parents to remind themselves that the situation is temporary, said &lt;a href="https://thecounselaur.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lauren Tetenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based licensed clinical social worker who specializes in maternal mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000o3b6mza9c9hlc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Be gentle with yourself and accept that if today is a sick day for your kid, it likely won’t be your best day at work,” she said. “Health is truly the priority here, and if you wear yourself down trying to do everything at 100% and get sick yourself, you’ll have even more to worry about when it comes to balancing it all.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000p3b6mr3fdmkx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We also have to ask for help, Tetenbaum said. “It’s really important to build a system of supportive adults who can step in as needed, even if your kid may be spreading germs. That adult can be a paid babysitter, a family member or a neighbor or friend who will do you a favor that you will one day return.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000q3b6mdj1km9jj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tetenbaum, who is a mom of two elementary school-age kids, said it’s important “not (to) assume that one parent is always the default caregiver.” In most families, that’s the mom. “Couples must explicitly communicate about who can do what on certain days, even if one parent usually has a more flexible schedule,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000r3b6muybvumaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She also recommended that parents be compassionate with themselves. “You are doing your best,” she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000s3b6mukjylcc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For me, it means sometimes allowing my daughters to consume extra media content, such as YouTube videos or online content from PBS Kids, while making sure it’s appropriate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000t3b6mwuvnq4st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When kids return to school, Glazier said there are ways to try to prevent them from bringing the next virus home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000u3b6miuau406x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping up to date with vaccinations is important, he said. The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/influenza/#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics,can%20be%20used%20for%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that all kids over age 6 months get the flu vaccine unless they have medical reasons not to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000v3b6mev4x0vh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Making sure kids get good nutrition and enough sleep and exercise can also help keep their immune systems healthy. “A strong healthy immune system will help both prevent and minimize the effects of infections,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000w3b6mbj22333q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also suggested telling kids to wash their hands frequently, especially before they eat at school. They should wash for at least 20 seconds, he said, which is about how much time it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000x3b6mazhi2ngl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s not possible to do so at school before eating, they should use a hand sanitizer. (I stashed a small one in my daughter’s backpack.) A hand sanitizer can’t kill all germs, but it can help protect against many.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000y3b6mgd8ue2we@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also a good idea to send food to school that kids can eat with utensils, rather than with their hands, which could be full of germs, Glazier said. And he recommended telling kids not to share food with their friends. While hard to enforce, it’s another way to avoid the spread of germs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz8000z3b6muux7r4w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When many classmates are sick, it’s also a good idea to have kids wash their hands and change their clothes when they come home from school, even before giving them hugs, Glazier said. Doing so can help prevent them from making their parents sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm79a4qz800103b6m4ekuh8h0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Taking care of a sick kid isn’t easy, especially when parents also have to work. But parents with the option to work remotely can be strategic about keeping our kids home when they’re sick and teaching them about hygiene for when they return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

If she had listened to the first doctor, White isn’t sure what could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TTCVGXFYLFGAFGDL4PQOGIUIQE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/liver/childhood-liver-cancer/undifferentiated-embryonal-sarcoma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cancer.gov/types/liver/childhood-liver-cancer/undifferentiated-embryonal-sarcoma"&gt;According to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, children may not show symptoms of UESL until the tumor has grown larger. It’s important to consult your child’s doctor if they experience a lump in the abdomen, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, or fatigue and loss of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;‘He has to stay home with her and I have to stay here’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VA77NXANBFFIHDACHDX7MJS5OI"&gt;White shared that there is a treatment plan in place for Arcelia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2OKJH2UBRVAWBFWTK7GJBEDPSU"&gt;Ideally, this includes rounds of chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill growing cancer cells, followed by surgery to remove the tumor, and then more rounds of chemotherapy to help her go into remission, White explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UIDPVOQ3RRCQXDPQFHHLZ5HUII"&gt;Arcelia began her first round of chemotherapy on Jan. 1, 2025. For three consecutive days, she receives three-and-a-half-hour chemotherapy sessions, followed by a three-and-a-half-week break for her body to adjust. This cycle then repeats until her last session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RCOFEAYIYZCNNHPENASCZGAPUU"&gt;“She’s going to have a total of four of those sessions, and we’re already two down,” White said, adding that the third one is expected to be next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZCZ7WIAEZNAGNH3GMVC32LNMVE"&gt;White was initially with her daughter for a month in the hospital, going home for a week before returning for chemotherapy, and then spending time at home in between treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IIKKI23JCRFKJGEIMSGJI4WU6Y"&gt;“A lot of the time, we’re here at the hospital. For any sign of loss of appetite, you have to bring her in. For fever. For any little sign of any difference we see in her,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GPAWKYRSFZBJRBMNOWJBMOBRJI"&gt;White explained the unpredictability of the treatment plan: After her final round of chemotherapy, Arcelia will have surgery to remove the tumor, if possible. If not, she’ll continue chemo until the tumor shrinks. And if the surgery is successful, she’ll have a few more rounds of chemo before remission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3FH3UX2CXVD5VCSXAT6PJEM3FU"&gt;However, if the surgery is not successful and some of the tumor remains, she will undergo another four to six rounds of chemotherapy before another attempt at surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T5ZEA5TPZNCSPN7OEXMQBL5GLE"&gt;“It took weeks of accepting this and being there for her. Me being sad or not realizing the reality of the situation would probably be worse for her than if I’m here and supportive... and we have a good team, amazing nurses, and great support,” White said. “That’s what’s going to get Arcelia through it at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SEN2XMMIYNHYTAZW2DP4542ZYU"&gt;White and her partner Johnathan Mendez are tag-teaming to manage the situation, with Mendez staying at home with Arcelia’s sister, Josie, who can’t be at the hospital overnight since she’s under 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SPL4B2XHXBAWTED2GCIFRKV2ZI"&gt;“He has to stay home with her and I have to stay here. We both have stopped working,” White said, adding that Josie can’t go to day care right now because even a mild illness could be passed to Arcelia and land her in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PUPA7WPN7FGMDKEUULKGT3RDPA"&gt;“Without him I would be nothing. He is my back bone,” White said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Turning to the community for support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5NLILVNKB5DA3HIXZSJIXRQL44"&gt;White shared that, financially, the day-to-day expenses -- like car payments, groceries and rent -- bring a sense of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O4W4K4PHDZFPDAWDVNQLC4ZJLY"&gt;“We’re very proud people. I was refusing to do a GoFundMe while my family was encouraging it. I was like, ‘No, how can we ask for money in such a hard time... I mean, eggs are costing you an arm and a leg,’” she said. “But once I sat down and realized, I am in a situation where there is no other option... it’s either I’m going to lose my house or I need to reach out to my community and my people and ask for help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QRKIDVGTRVFTNIWTWBKOL5ICDE"&gt;White organized a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/join-arcelias-battle-against-cancer?attribution_id=sl:52fe155a-e3ee-4b67-a7b8-a09d8d0a5db1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp10_t2&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/join-arcelias-battle-against-cancer?attribution_id=sl:52fe155a-e3ee-4b67-a7b8-a09d8d0a5db1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp10_t2&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to raise funds for Arcelia’s fight against cancer, which has left both her and her partner out of work and behind on bills.

                                    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s new approach to communicating health and medical data has left a hazy picture of the country’s fight against bird flu and has complicated the relationship between the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.notus.org/senate/rfk-confirmed-health-secretary-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal health bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and state agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some state health officials told NOTUS they’ve continued to get what they need from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other officials and outside experts say they’re worried about what they’re not being told and how that could be hampering the urgent push against H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        &lt;p id="googleAd74b68e84-c25c-4aca-b261-ffff74316b79" data-module class="GoogleDfpAd" data-slot-name="23211035655/article/leaderboard" data-slot-sizes="[[300, 250]]" data-slot-adsizemap="[[[834, 320], [728, 90]]]"&gt;
    &lt;span class="GoogleDfpAd-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p&gt;But at least some of the dysfunction of the federal health agencies has trickled down to the states that have had human infections, say some pandemic experts and health officials — making responding to the ongoing H5N1 outbreak that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking forward to your dreams at night makes you more likely to remember them,  a study has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Italian scientists seeking to understand why some people remember their dreams while others do not also found daydreaming can improve your ability to &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-96896a60-ede0-11ef-81ab-6fd638194cbe"&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; details from the sleeping subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on experiments with 200 participants, the results also showed how other factors influence whether or not people remember their dreams — such as age and the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, from IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, asked participants to wear sleep-monitoring devices and used tape recorders to document their dream recollections over a 15-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Volunteers, aged 18 to 70, were also required to undergo psychological tests before the experiment to assess aspects such as anxiety levels, interest in dreams, and proneness to 'mind-wandering', or daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers described mind-wandering as a tendency to shift focus away from tasks and instead concentrate on 'unrelated thoughts or internal reflections', similar to daydreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings revealed clear patterns in who was more likely to recall their dreams—and in vivid detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who enjoyed dreaming, and saw it as beneficial to wellbeing, and those who frequently engaged in mind-wandering were more likely to remember their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having a positive attitude, frequent daydreaming are the best way to remember your dreams, a study suggests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found participants who experienced longer periods of 'light sleep'—as opposed to deeper, more restful sleep—were more likely to recall their dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger participants were generally better at remembering dreams than older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older people more commonly experienced what researchers termed 'white dreams'—a state where they remembered having a dream the night before but couldn't recall specific details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors, writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44271-025-00191-z"&gt;Communications Psychology,&lt;/a&gt; said this suggested an age-related change in memory may influence the ability to recall dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who took part in the sleep experiment in spring were more likely to recall their dreams than those who did so in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists suggested this hinted at factors like sunlight exposure, which is higher in the warmer months, playing a potential role in the ability to recall dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Giulio Bernardi, expert in psychology and author of the study, said the results suggested the ability to recall dreams was a complex process influenced by many factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors added they hope the study will form a base point for similar research on the ability to recall dreams in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It felt like she was underwater, and had to wait for a wave to pass to come up for air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It was very scary, because you didn’t know how long that wave would last,” Ms. Ramirez, now 55, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For months, she dismissed the issues as a flare-up of her asthma, anxiety over her father’s recent cancer diagnosis or a sign of impending menopause. But when she finally got checked out, a doctor diagnosed Ms. Ramirez with heart failure. Her condition eventually became so severe that she needed a heart transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Heart failure is a condition that occurs when the heart can’t pump out enough blood and oxygen to meet the body’s needs. Deaths from it have been &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2817830" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;climbing steadily nationwide&lt;/a&gt; since 2012, wiping out earlier declines. Rising rates of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure are likely contributing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are medications to treat one of the two main types of heart failure, but they aren’t used &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30025570/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;as much as they should be&lt;/a&gt;, doctors said. “The treatments that have been proven in trials to work are not getting prescribed to people in a timely way,” said Dr. Janet Wright, the director of the division for heart disease and stroke prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But growing awareness of the condition and its risk factors could change that. And new drugs to treat the other form of heart failure could also change the trajectory for patients with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Is this true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you browse social media for information on healthy sleep habits, you may stumble across &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thewellnesswaylargo/video/7311740483749940526" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;one of the many posts&lt;/a&gt; arguing that women require more sleep than men — “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cl63-Y3p-Ex/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dramatically more sleep&lt;/a&gt;,” some even claim. The reasons given vary, including hormonal differences and the notion that women have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD9_ffXPPDZ/?igsh=dGdxaXQya3JsMmht" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;faster-working brains&lt;/a&gt; than men do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As it turns out, we don’t have any legitimate research that suggests these claims are true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There is no evidence that there is a fundamental biological reason women need more sleep,” said Dr. Suzanne Bertisch, a physician specializing in sleep disorders&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On average, women do seem to spend several more minutes in bed every night than men do, but that doesn’t mean they require more sleep, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-316bc781"&gt;Men and Women Sleep Differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Only a handful of studies have evaluated differences in sleep duration among men and women. In a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4164903/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; from 2013, researchers analyzed survey data from more than 56,000 adults in the United States. When participants were asked how they spent their time over a recent 24-hour period, women reported devoting an average of 11 minutes more to sleep the previous night than men did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This didn’t necessarily mean that the women actually slept for 11 minutes more than men, however. As the study explained, the time participants reported also included the minutes they spent attempting to sleep — and women are far &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714764/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;more likely than men&lt;/a&gt; to experience insomnia, said Rebecca Robbins, a sleep scientist and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The 2013 study also found that women were nearly five times as likely as men to report sleep interruptions as a result of caregiving, usually for a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research suggests that &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/well/women-sleep-issues-hormones.html" title=""&gt;women experience lower quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, on average, than men do — whether they’re caregivers or not.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of different species of microbes live in your gut. In the future, one of these might serve a new function: microscopic in-house pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A new study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02570-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 18 in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/i&gt; shows how &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; can be directed to produce and release proteins within the lower gastrointestinal tract—eliminating a major roadblock to delivering drugs to that part of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral medication is the most common and practical means of drug administration, but the stomach doesn't let much pass through unscathed. This is good when it comes to things like foodborne pathogens, but gut-focused therapies are regularly deactivated and flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented workaround, biologist Bryan Hsu's team engineered bacteria-eating viruses called phages to infect and reprogram &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacterial+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial cells&lt;/a&gt; to produce and release a sustained flow of a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/protein/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;-based drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with immunologist Liwu Li, Hsu's research team showed that this approach can be used to potentially treat chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embrace your inner spider alien&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages (phages for short) are viruses that naturally infect bacteria. Phages are harder to classify than bacteria and therefore less understood, but we do know how they attack bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attaching to a bacterial cell, phages inject their own DNA and reprogram the cell so that it manufactures more phages—agents of the cell's own destruction. When the bacterial cell eventually succumbs, it explodes into a flood of new phages in a process called lysis. Millions of these events happening simultaneously produce a constant supply of a targeted protein inside the lower intestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though phages act (and look) like spider aliens, they are regular players on the gut-microbiome home team. In fact, their ubiquity is what prompted Hsu to explore using them to introduce and deliver therapeutic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary Baker, a doctoral student in the Hsu Lab, engineered special phages that inject a little extra genetic material into the bacterial cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to making a flurry of new phages, the instructions prompt the cell to produce a tagalong protein that can lend itself to targeted therapies inside the lower intestines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Engineered proteins reduced inflammation, obesity in mice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove their technique, Baker and research assistant professor Yao Zhang successfully applied these engineered &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/phages/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;phages&lt;/a&gt; to tackle symptoms associated with two separate diseases in mice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced inflammation by releasing a protein that inhibited an enzyme associated with inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced obesity by releasing a protein that induced a feeling of satiety in mice given a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; that is typically associated with Western diets, which are often linked to an increased risk of obesity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these results, Hsu's team demonstrated proof-of-concept for a new drug-delivery method. They are currently exploring commercial potential of this innovation through the National Science Foundation I-Corps program and the Fralin Commercialization Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the drug-delivery problem has at least two parts. Hsu's next challenge involves getting drugs absorbed from the gut into systemic circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like we're Amazon. We got the stuff there, we dropped it off on the doorstep," Hsu said. "Now we need to figure out how to ring the doorbell."&lt;/p&gt;

Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/what_foods_help_repair_kidneys/article.htm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;foods help repair kidneys&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-blueberries/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high levels of antioxidants and loads of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/why-you-need-vitamin-c-for-immune-support-and-how-to-get-enough/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Dark, leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=Dark%20green%20leafy%20vegetables%20are,many%20of%20the%20B%2Dvitamins." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;key vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;, plus immunity-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;A study from Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618629/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;people with CKD&lt;/a&gt;, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the same family as garlic, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-onions" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt; give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Cauliflower&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282844" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Egg whites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/core-kidney/patient-resources/eating-healthy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Egg whites&lt;/a&gt; are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Arugula&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-arugula" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Arugula&lt;/a&gt; is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPS2Q5UXBTWUNEOGFwMEpBanRGVVd6SFh0MWdneWNIU2pBUVNrX0FsOFRkWnQ0dS00TF9CVnBrWUlJTk95b3FUZ3dKXzZTcENjSUhhOWRrTWc0VUhrRFBzTFRFNmlEZ0FlSUl4TlJzUGRXVFg0TjJKUG1oN1RaN1haT1d6RDQ</guid></item><item><title>'I'm cutting down on ultra-processed food – these swaps are game-changing' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQMnpCZGRZd2l4eWRmVkl4RFlNbmZSSEUzM2dld0FKaGlFUUxHYXRvTHhWblc4Z1RIbDFZRzhQa0Z3LU1lX0NoYW41aDRvcWVJRzJIMWdZSE81Nkdyd3JSTFdSaDZranJpNlkzdi1ZdVpjdWFjRDF3TldqdG5hbURrWWV3N3RqUzDSAYwBQVVfeXFMUDJLN3I0UmpaeGdVNnhRTVZHUzQxMHlFS1hnbDNiT0UyNVZmVkJpNmJsODR4ZzVBLTZZYjNDWE1QZjVISDZ1TVRUMWVOeEFyZTB5eHlvaFl2emp3MnBRdE8xemJycDh6VDVPOUlDUlcxQzBqZmtZb3lnVU9wX0dpNFp3OTZJZ3BtdEFJaDY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are not as healthy as eating whole &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/food-and-drink" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be tough to know where to start when making swaps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation: "Ultra-processed foods typically have more than one ingredient that you never or rarely find in a kitchen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They also tend to include many additives and ingredients that are not typically used in &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;home cooking&lt;/a&gt;, such as preservatives, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and artificial colours and flavours. These foods generally have a long shelf life."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But why are they so bad for us? They often contain "high levels of saturated fat, salt and sugar," and "it’s also been suggested that the additives in these foods could be responsible for negative health effects".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's why Katie Duarte made a TikTok showing the ultra-processed food &lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;swaps &lt;/a&gt;she made, captioning her video: "&lt;span&gt;Easy swaps to reduce the amount of ultra-processed food (UPF) in your family diet. Ideally, we would make all food from scratch, but realistically, most of us do not have the time (I certainly don’t)."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Katie said that she was trying to be a "little more mindful" about what she and her family ate, and she started with bread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Most sliced bread has way too many ingredients. We've made the swap to Jason's sourdough," she shared, also saying that wraps are "super processed". She said she'd made a swap to a brand where the "only ingredients are flour, water, extra virgin olive oil and salt". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katie said another good and easy swap was to opt for real butter rather than spreadable. She said "good plain old butter" is better than any alternative. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, she shared that pasta sauce is a good swap, saying that she makes 99% of hers "from scratch," but she likes to have "jars in the cupboard just in case" she needs it and doesn't have the ingredients to make it there and then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She recommended the specially selected pesto from Aldi because it's made with extra virgin olive oil. She also recommended Heinz pasta sauces that are made with extra virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next up was milk. "So I was an Oatley Barista die-hard fan, but sadly, I had to let it go because it does have rapeseed oil in it, which is probably why it tasted so good," she shared. Katie shared that she's swapped to whole milk, but Plenish is a good "plant-based alternative".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then she said that she'd made cereal swaps, saying that if you like 'normal' cereals, "it's fine, everything in balance," but she said if you do want swaps, then organic oats are a good idea. Also, granola with extra virgin olive oil in, instead of rapeseed oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the video comments, people gave their own tips for different food items. One wrote: "Top tip for pasta sauce - batch cook it and put it in large ice cube trays like the weaning ones, freeze them. Then, when you make pasta, just pop a cube out of the freezer". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another added: "Very helpful! I’ve noticed that the least processed pizzas I could find in Sainsbury’s were the cheapest own-brand ones."

The Arctic Air is blasting the Empire State and wind chills are well below zero from Buffalo to Albany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it won'y be too long before the spring does get here and most people get out of the house and head to great outdoors!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you own property, or recently purchased some land in New York State, now is the time to get a plan in place to mark the borders on your land to keep trespassers away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What The Law Says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State has some very specific laws pertaining to trespassing and what the responsibilities are of landowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the "11X11" law. &lt;a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/forests-trees/private-forest-management/posting-your-land" target="_blank"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that there are specific dimensions that are required for the &lt;a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/forests-trees/private-forest-management/posting-your-land" target="_blank"&gt;size posted signs&lt;/a&gt; need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Signs must be a minimum of 11 inches by 11 inches. They also must bear the name and address of the owner, lawful occupant or other person or organization authorized to post the area".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some hefty fines in place for those who are caught trespassing here in New York State. However, for those who own the land, it is very frustrating to pay taxes, keep it posted and still have people wonder on private property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quick Reminder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the summer approaches, it is a good idea to remember that unless you are on New York State property, you are on private property and should ask for permission before you enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;LOOK: 11 tick-borne illnesses and what to watch out for during your outdoor adventures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://stacker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Stacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compiled a list of 11 common tick-borne diseases in the U.S. and what symptoms to watch out for, using a variety of medical and government sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Martha Sandoval&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wyrk.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 09:11:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE02Y2luZ3ZhWWY2ZktDTDF5WnNVS0NJY1RDMkgwLUVDc1ZET1BqU3dTZHA5SFg2WjR3MG5qTGYxcjdYQVVUNk5IYXl6ZFU3ZlY3M0FPeVd4WjRRcXpoV1NpZmd2Zw</guid></item><item><title>Mum has incurable cancer after doctors said symptoms 'just period' - Bristol Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQcy0xZjFpZ29IMTlBZGw0YnB0V2FlT2h5clBtRnJoeFpUUTFmRXU2eHJmYjYwTy1uWEdmU0VTY0d1RkE0SGFJN1R6bkQ5R1VkWVRYODU2dVliRGM4WDdESGVpajB4U2tZdmdWM1lEUDJ2d3ZzdGJSWUxCTkFRY0dyVGJvVmFyMHpKR1JsWm1NYlZkM0EtaUHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUFUyRVZwX0lVZXBiSlhFajJ1RmV5MGtkQmdJYloyTnNpd3dvTzJJU0x4dnVrdHFKYWVET0gwVF9XM0s4MzhHQkxvZ24zUXJ4bHE0ZDZYaVNtOWlTc09LLUcyMFZuQzBsRXd4N1VDNkZUZjFKTlJacTF3TC1XdFBoNEZ5Ykw2c1EzaWVLYWJsdUxNc3RJRzdCRnVLQXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mum who was diagnosed with stage four cervical cancer claims doctors said her blood clot symptoms were "just your period". &lt;span&gt;Charley Jayne Law, 31, began bleeding clots the size of her "palms" but was dismissed by doctors on multiple visits to a London hospital over two months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She was eventually referred to gynaecology at King's College Hospital and was diagnosed on January 27, 2025 after a &lt;br&gt; number of blood tests, transfusions and iron tests. &lt;span&gt;Charley was so unwell she had to be admitted as an inpatient and had to make the hard decision to put her children into emergency foster care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now at Guy's Cancer Centre she has been told her cancer is incurable but treatable and is building up strength - after dropping from 12st to 7st - so she can start chemotherapy. &lt;span&gt;Charley, a full-time mum from Sydenham, London, said: "I was bleeding clots the size of my palms. I attended hospital multiple times between September and December 2024 and was fobbed off with "it's just your period" by multiple male doctors who didn't even do the basics of an examination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="9953641" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The news on January 27 tore my world apart. &lt;span&gt;My body was on the verge of giving up as during this entire time I was still mum.

She then taps journalists from the Well section or health and science freelance writers to report the answers, with the help of experts and research. The column, which publishes every Tuesday morning, aims to provide a judgment-free zone for people to pose even their most personal health concerns. (The questions are published anonymously.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In an interview, Ms. Calderone spoke about how she picks questions, what topics she won’t assign and what she hopes people take away from the column. This interview has been edited and condensed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Do you look for questions that are topical?

                                    &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business Insider has spoken to lots of centenarians about what they think has helped them live past 100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many have kept fit without going to the gym.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building movement into daily life is one of their top tips. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hate working out but want the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/exercise-for-healthy-aging-longevity-strength-training-personal-trainer-2024-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;life-lengthening benefits of exercise&lt;/a&gt;, you may find it reassuring that many centenarians Business Insider has spoken to have never set foot in a gym. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some degree, the type of exercise you do seems to matter less than how often you do it. Nathan K. LeBrasseur, a physiologist who studies healthy aging, previously told BI that people should do an exercise they enjoy because then they're more likely to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-102-year-old-centenarian-research-backed-longevity-tips-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;102-year-old Deborah Szekely&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a ranch in Baja California, Mexico, agrees. "What matters is that you're pushing yourself enough to feel it, getting your heart rate up, and breaking a sweat. If you get really huffy puffy, you're doing a good job," she told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-getting-fit-any-age-cyclist-daily-start-exercising-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;never too late&lt;/a&gt; to get active. A 2023 study by researchers at Duke Kunshan University, China, found that participants over the age of 80 who were physically active were more likely to live longer than those who were inactive — even if they started later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how centenarians who spoke to BI said they stayed fit.&lt;/p&gt;

A 2023 review of studies published in the journal GeroScience found that walking appeared to decrease the risk of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/what-is-heart-disease" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, type 2 diabetes, cognitive impairment, and dementia, while also improving mental well-being, sleep, and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c1570d99-e90b-48e6-b011-0e1a6be942c6" data-toc-id="c1570d99-e90b-48e6-b011-0e1a6be942c6"&gt;2) Cycle instead of driving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin McEvilly, who was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ireland-oldest-man-longevity-secrets-healthy-aging-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Ireland's oldest man&lt;/a&gt; when he died aged 108 last October, never owned a car. Instead his bicycle was his primary form of transport until he was 99. Even once he stopped cycling everywhere, he continued to use a stationary exercise bike until he was 105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 review of studies published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living found a link between cycling regularly and better mental well-being, a lower risk of dying from any cause, and a lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/what-causes-type-2-diabetes" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7088ebd7-ff62-4e56-af36-e139d5fff931" data-toc-id="7088ebd7-ff62-4e56-af36-e139d5fff931"&gt;3) Make exercise social&lt;/h2&gt;

Meanwhile, 103-year-old Janet Gibbs &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-tips-centenarian-who-played-golf-younger-friends-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;played golf until she was 86&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as physical benefits, the social aspect of exercising could also help us live longer. Professor Rose Anne Kenny, the chair of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and head of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, argues that socializing is more &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-antiaging-friendship-social-interaction-relationships-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;important for longevity&lt;/a&gt; than exercise or a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0837eba2-77b6-4c58-ae2e-6cb2cdc6e8a9" data-toc-id="0837eba2-77b6-4c58-ae2e-6cb2cdc6e8a9"&gt;4) Build exercise into your job or hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many centenarians did hard physical jobs, such as McEvilly who worked on his family farm. His days were spent cutting up turf for fuel, trimming plants, collecting water, and gathering moss to use for animal bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;The average US worker is likely to spend half of their day sitting down, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, but even if you have a mostly sedentary job you can build movement into your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just doing 20 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a day can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-exercise-prevent-death-sitting-all-day-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;offset the impacts of sitting&lt;/a&gt; down all day, a 2023 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Five years after the COVID outbreak sparked a frantic push for vaccines to build what public health officials called “herd immunity,” a growing number of Americans don’t want to be part of the herd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The rapid COVID vaccines rollout was credited with saving millions of lives. While scientists and health officials hailed it as a triumph of science and logistics, a potent mix of politics, fatigue, and misinformation has taken hold in recent years, leaving much of the public wary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health care providers, who strongly recommend vaccines as safe and effective, said such hesitation and outright resistance to vaccines has become disturbingly common even in Massachusetts, a state at the forefront of the campaign to develop and distribute COVID vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Indeed, a Boston Globe data analysis shows vaccination rates in the state, which have long surpassed the US average, have now dropped below those of the nation for COVID — and even more dramatically for flu, where vaccine uptake has fallen by half among those 19 and younger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most alarming to doctors and health officials in Massachusetts is a decline in immunization for serious childhood diseases, such as measles and mumps, that were largely suppressed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;through vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The motives for those refusing vaccines vary. They range from a sense that past exposure to vaccines or COVID continues to convey immunity to a belief that health officials overstated the value of the shots to the embrace of discredited internet conspiracy theories that government leaders were using vaccines as levers of political control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Farren, who said she’s considering homeschooling her daughter in part to avoid school vaccine requirements, questions their effectiveness and objects to the “sheep mentality” behind inoculation drives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’s far from alone. Only about 22 percent of adults in Massachusetts and 23 percent nationally received the most recent booster this fall and winter, federal and state data show as of late January. By contrast, in the year after shots first became available in 2021, more than 82 percent in Massachusetts and nearly 70 percent of US adults were fully vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I don’t think vaccines help,” said retired school teacher Diane Grady of Swampscott. Grady similarly was vaccinated during the outbreak, bowing to what she now calls “scare tactics,” but has stopped lining up for COVID or other vaccines in recent years. “I got on the bandwagon during COVID only so I could see my grandchildren,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new vaccine resistance dovetails with the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., confirmed by the Senate last week as President Trump’s new secretary of health and human services. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, told senators he is merely “pro-safety” and now believes vaccines play a critical role in health care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the mainstreaming of once-fringe anti-vax beliefs by Kennedy and others calls into question whether the nation, still grappling with the aftermath of COVID, can rally to blunt the next&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;health threat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Not everyone’s willing to accept my recommendations,” said Dr. Hugh Taylor, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, who practices as a family physician in the North Shore town of Hamilton and urges his patients to get vaccinated. “It’s not hard to find people who’ve heard different opinions about vaccines on the internet or even at the grocery store or a soccer game.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Much of the COVID vaccination falloff can be attributed to the reality of broader immunity, said Jen Kates, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most American adults got shots during the pandemic, many contracted COVID, and deaths from COVID have declined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The majority of people in the US don’t feel the need to get the vaccine,” Kates said. “They don’t feel at risk. They feel COVID is over.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

They help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are excellent sources of iron and folate, while citrus fruits provide immune-boosting vitamin C. Berries, carrots, and tomatoes are packed with antioxidants that fight inflammation and oxidative stress. Aim for a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Select whole grains for fiber and nutrients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, including brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat, oats, and barley, are rich in fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like magnesium and selenium. Whole grains contain bran and germ, unlike refined grains, which contain the essential nutrients and aid digestion. Diets with high fiber help control blood sugar, reduce cholesterol, and aid in gut health. Daily inclusion of whole grains provides sustained energy and enhanced digestive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Choose healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all fats are bad. Healthy fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats contribute to heart health, brain activity, and cell growth. Sources of good fat are olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocados. These reduce the levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) but raise the level of good cholesterol (HDL), reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, trans fats and too much saturated fats, which usually occur in processed food and fried foods, should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Opt for low-fat proteins, including lean meat, poultry, fish and legumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for repair of muscles, immune system functioning, and overall body maintenance. Opting for lean protein sources promotes healthy weight and chronic disease prevention. Good choices include skinless poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans), and low-fat dairy products. Fish, especially fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which benefit brain and heart function. Balancing plant and animal proteins guarantees nutrient adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reduce salt intake to lower blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased intake of salt has been associated with high blood pressure, heart conditions, and kidney disease. Salt is present in large quantities in processed foods, fast foods, and prepared foods. Fresh and home-cooked foods should be chosen to limit salt consumption. Instead of using salt, vegetables, lemon juice, garlic, or spices may be used as seasonings for food. Even reading the label on foods that contain sodium may assist in maintaining a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Control portion sizes to manage calorie intake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overeating, even healthy foods, can lead to weight gain and metabolic disorders. Being mindful of portion sizes helps regulate calorie intake and maintain a balanced diet. Using smaller plates, serving controlled portions, and eating slowly can prevent overeating. Listening to hunger and fullness cues is also essential for better digestion and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Plan daily menus emphasizing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins and good fats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-structured daily menu should emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Planning meals in advance helps ensure a balanced nutrient intake and reduces the temptation to opt for unhealthy choices. A typical meal could include a bowl of oatmeal with nuts and fruit for breakfast, a salad with lean protein and whole grains for lunch, and a vegetable-rich stir-fry with quinoa or brown rice for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Enjoy occasional treats in moderation without derailing your healthy eating plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completely eliminating favorite foods can lead to cravings and unhealthy eating patterns. Instead of strict restrictions, allow occasional treats in moderation. Whether it's a piece of dark chocolate, a small serving of dessert, or a few chips, enjoying indulgent foods mindfully prevents feelings of deprivation and helps sustain long-term healthy eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" believes the cardiologist. "No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>How you could be breathing in harmful airborne bacteria if you fail to do one thing when you go to the toilet - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watch out if you don't put the toilet seat down before flushing, because of nasty bacteria which shoot up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flushing the toilet sends a plume of tiny water droplets into the air surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most common potentially harmful airborne bacteria propelled from the toilet bowls of indoor bathrooms are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-576e3960-ed76-11ef-929b-3d7bfb423746"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt; and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can be inhaled, raising the risk of getting a nasty stomach bug or respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers measured the two types of bacteria in two bathrooms within an office building in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-577dc9c0-ed76-11ef-929b-3d7bfb423746"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One contained a squat toilet, which is a 'hole-in-the-floor' toilet type popular in China, that people squat over before using, while the other bathroom had a bidet toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Showing their commitment to science, the researchers used actual human stools to test for the bacteria created when flushing both toilets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was compared to the bacteria in the air after flushing the toilets when they were empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Watch out if you don't put the toilet seat down before flushing, because of nasty bacteria which shoot up into the air. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concentrations of the bacteria in the air were found to be 16 to 27 per cent lower for E. coli after flushing an empty toilet compared to flushing a stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concentration was 25 to 43 per cent lower for S. aureus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say the findings for squat toilets would apply to normal seated toilets as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However the study found good ventilation could reduce the proportion of these airborne bacteria particles, which scientists call bioaerosols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wajid Ali, who led the study from China University of Geosciences, said: 'Our findings underscore the substantial health risks posed by bioaerosol exposure in public washrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Enhancing ventilation systems by optimising exhaust fan efficiency and air exchange rates can effectively reduce bioaerosol concentrations and exposure risks for the public.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bacteria lurking within human waste in toilets is 'agitated' when they are flushed, according to the researchers, because of the 'swirling, splashing, and bubbling' water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous evidence has shown the nasty microbes hang around in the toilet even after dozens of flushes, but that closing the lid prior to flushing will reduce the amount of bacteria in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Among the most common potentially harmful airborne bacteria propelled from the toilet bowls of indoor bathrooms are E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Pictured: File photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study looked at people's likely exposure to airborne bacteria in the bathrooms examined, the probability of getting ill, and then how long someone might expect to be ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The period of illness which could be caused by toilet bacteria was calculated using Disability-Adjusted Life Years, which are used by health experts to measure the time people spend unable to live normally in full health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the measurements of bacteria concentrations from the toilets were found to risk people's health above the acceptable benchmark for DALYs set by the World Health Organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inhaling the bacteria could produce symptoms like abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However using an exhaust fan reduced the risk from the bacteria 10-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal Risk Analysis, highlights the importance of ventilation, noting that compared to private bathrooms, public toilets are particularly risky, because they are used more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flushing the toilet before using it unfortunately doesn't work perfectly, as the water remains contaminated after multiple flushes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high percentage of airborne bacteria found in the study was attributed to the interaction between liquid and air during toilet flushing, along with the siphon phenomenon created by the high water flow velocity, which predominantly releases tiny bioaerosol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;Northwest Naturals Pet Food issued a statement today (2/17/25). The pet food company shared the FDA and Oregon Department of Agriculture performed an audit/inspection of their manufacturing facility (a licensed USDA inspected human food facility) from late December 2024 through February 7, 2025. And…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The FDA’s audit did not contain any findings related to H5N1 or Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), and the FDA did not identify the source of the alleged contamination found in the opened bag of our product. Additionally, our product was never included in the FDA’s list of Recalls &amp;amp; Withdrawals, which can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/safety-health/recalls-withdrawals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/safety-health/recalls-withdrawals&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the completion of FDA’s audit, we updated the status of our voluntary recall with ODA to ‘closed’ and the recall has since been terminated.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;This means, that for six weeks regulatory authorities searched and tested and searched and tested…but they found NO contamination of Northwest Naturals pet food with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;This means that even though Oregon Department of Agriculture stated “&lt;em&gt;We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food&lt;/em&gt;” in a press release – it turns out…&lt;strong&gt;they were wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Drinking alcohol if you have a large belly or diabetes more than doubles the risk of serious liver damage, while having high blood pressure and drinking nearly doubles the risk, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are important health risks to consider, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are going to do exactly what they shouldn't do, and poison themselves," Freeman said. "Particularly during big (sports events), people will eat things like hot dogs, sausage, bacon, pepperoni and ham — and these processed meats are in the same category as cigarettes for cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're eating all these highly processed, high fat, high sugar foods, insulin goes into overdrive, which creates insulin resistance, then excess blood sugar and then fatty liver," Freeman added. "Then if you're drinking on top of it, it just amplifies the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men, which is often associated with obesity, is one of several cardiometabolic risk factors that also include high blood sugar and elevated blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all Americans have high blood pressure, more than 1 in 3 have pre-diabetes, while about 40% of the population is considered obese, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These health conditions contribute to a buildup of fat in the liver, experts say, which can then lead to fibrosis or scarring of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people don't realize this, but before one develops diabetes, for example, they typically first develop fatty liver," Freeman said. "It has to do with sugar dysregulation — when you have high blood sugars, your liver is storing fat to get rid of some of that sugar, and it's that excess fat that impairs liver function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, drinking damages liver cells trying to metabolize alcohol and can lead to additional fat buildup. The inflammation and scarring caused by excess fat may eventually lead to cirrhosis, which increases the risk of liver failure and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This double whammy of fatty deposits may be a reason behind the significant increase in liver scarring the study found among moderate to heavy drinkers with chronic conditions, said lead study author Dr. Brian Lee, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results identify a very high-risk segment of the population prone to liver disease and suggest that preexisting health issues may have a large impact on how alcohol affects the liver," Lee said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person may not have a big belly, high blood pressure, or diabetes does not mean that it's safe for people to heavily consume alcohol, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that alcohol is toxic to the liver and all heavy drinkers are at risk for advanced liver disease," Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'heavy' drinker?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published recently in the Journal of &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(25)00081-3/abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology,&lt;/a&gt; analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national government survey of nearly 41,000 people. Of those, over 2,200 were categorized as "heavy" drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, women who drank more than 0.7 ounces or more a day and men who drank 1.05 ounces or more a day were defined as heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that amount of alcohol is typically considered to be "moderate" drinking, according to the CDC. A standard drink in the United States is defined as 0.6 ounces of pure liquor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's equivalent to five ounces of wine with 12% alcohol, a 12-ounce can of beer that is 5% alcohol or 1.5 ounces of liquor (80 proof) or distilled spirts. Most people don't realize they are pouring drinks that far exceed those standards, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at what people drink with dinner or as a cocktail, they're filling up their glass with three or four ounces," Freeman said. "If a restaurant came out and poured you five ounces of wine, you'd complain that they didn't fill your glass. People are probably drinking much more than they realize."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alarming number of new studies are finding that any amount of alcohol is dangerous to health. In January, then-U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a strongly worded advisory about the link between alcohol and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States – greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the US – yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk," Murthy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only 45% of Americans surveyed by the American Institute for Cancer Research in 2019 said they believed that drinking alcohol causes cancer, the new advisory notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Unlike subcutaneous fat, which is stored under the skin, visceral fat is more metabolically active and releases inflammatory markers that contribute to insulin resistance and chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercise and overall caloric balance play vital roles in fat reduction, specific foods have been scientifically proven to aid in targeting visceral fat. This article explores three of the best foods for reducing visceral belly fat, backed by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Fatty Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boxrox.com/10-foods-that-help-you-sleep-better-and-recover-faster/" data-type="post" data-id="224083"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, mackerel, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been extensively studied for their role in reducing visceral fat. Omega-3 fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and promote fat oxidation. A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals who consumed omega-3-rich foods had lower levels of visceral fat compared to those who did not (Kaushik et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;span id="isc_attachment_64766" class="isc-source "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-1024x708.jpg" alt="salmon magnesium deficiency" class="wp-image-64766 with-source" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-300x207.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-768x531.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-608x420.jpg 608w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-150x104.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-218x150.jpg 218w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-696x481.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-100x70.jpg 100w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-822x568.jpg 822w, https://image.boxrox.com/2017/10/salmon-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;span class="isc-source-text"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://depositphotos.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;tycoon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids also regulate cortisol levels, a stress hormone linked to increased abdominal fat storage. High cortisol levels, particularly in response to chronic stress, contribute to visceral fat accumulation. Research in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation significantly reduces cortisol levels, thereby mitigating fat storage around the abdomen (Delarue et al., 2003).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="stagi-29b79300e4f4c534488cc6984aa6cc89 stagi-content" id="stagi-29b79300e4f4c534488cc6984aa6cc89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids enhance mitochondrial efficiency, increasing the body’s ability to oxidise fat for energy. This process directly impacts visceral fat reduction, as shown in a study published in &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt; that found a significant decrease in visceral fat in individuals consuming omega-3-rich diets (Buckley &amp;amp; Howe, 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. High-Fibre Foods: Legumes and Whole Grains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibre, particularly soluble fibre, is a crucial component in the fight against visceral fat. Foods such as lentils, chickpeas, oats, and barley are rich in soluble fibre, which slows digestion and promotes satiety, reducing overall caloric intake. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt; found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fibre intake, visceral fat accumulation decreased by 3.7% over five years (Hairston et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fibre also plays a role in modulating gut microbiota, which influences fat metabolism and storage. Research published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; found that an improved gut microbiome composition, driven by increased fibre intake, led to lower visceral fat levels (Zhao et al., 2018). The fermentation of soluble fibre by gut bacteria produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which regulate fat metabolism and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-1024x698.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-207870" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-300x204.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-768x523.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-617x420.jpg 617w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-150x102.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-218x150.jpg 218w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-696x474.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-822x560.jpg 822w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Man-with-Barbell-Overhead-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, particularly those rich in beta-glucans like oats and barley, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the postprandial glucose spike, preventing excess fat storage. A study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals consuming whole grains had significantly lower visceral fat than those consuming refined grains (McKeown et al., 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="stagi-919b0fc80f66961d80393638686300b5 stagi-content" id="stagi-919b0fc80f66961d80393638686300b5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Green Tea and Catechins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea is widely recognised for its fat-burning properties, primarily due to its high catechin content. Catechins, a type of flavonoid, enhance fat oxidation and thermogenesis, leading to increased energy expenditure and visceral fat reduction. A meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Obesity&lt;/em&gt; concluded that individuals consuming green tea extract experienced significant reductions in visceral fat compared to control groups (Hursel et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most potent catechin in green tea, inhibits an enzyme that breaks down norepinephrine, a hormone that promotes fat breakdown. This prolongs norepinephrine’s activity, increasing fat mobilisation and oxidation. A study in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that daily consumption of green tea extract led to a 7.7% reduction in visceral fat over 12 weeks (Nagao et al., 2005).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-207823" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-300x200.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-768x512.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-630x420.jpg 630w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-696x464.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-822x548.jpg 822w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/06/Green-Tea-on-Green-Background-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea also enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, preventing excess visceral fat accumulation. Research published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that green tea catechins improved metabolic rate and reduced body fat, particularly in the abdominal region (Venables et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Best Foods for Burning Visceral Fat&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mechanism of Action&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fatty Fish (Omega-3s)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers cortisol levels&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;High-Fibre Foods (Legumes &amp;amp; Whole Grains)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enhances satiety, regulates gut microbiota, reduces insulin spikes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Green Tea (Catechins)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Increases fat oxidation, enhances thermogenesis, improves metabolic rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buckley, J.D. &amp;amp; Howe, P.R.C., 2009. &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;.
