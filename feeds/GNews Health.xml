Brain volume decreases, for example, and neural connections may weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGD7BX4SZELPNI7QBW2IVUU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These physical changes help explain the mental shifts that often come with aging, making it harder to recall a word or learn a new task. The risk of developing dementia — an umbrella term that includes Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and more — rises with age, too. But there are simple habits that can reduce your risk of memory loss and dementia — and slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IMLNJTAYJECZP4KGP5YFRSF6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Think about risks and protective factors on a seesaw,” says Joel Salinas, a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. “Your risk on one side and things that protect you against that risk” on the other. Even if you have a significant family history of dementia, for example, “there’s just so much you can do on the protective side of the seesaw to balance it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUQUS6ZDQBCHFIHBFA23ZGKTJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nearly half of all dementia cases worldwide could be delayed or prevented altogether by making lifestyle and environmental changes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;2024 report published in the journal the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. These same practices — which include regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management and good sleep — can help slow the cognitive symptoms that come with normal aging. And recent research highlights other ways you can reduce your risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C42XBRMFLBFWBPTHH5UJSJQBIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/b&gt; Staying active enhances cognitive fitness in addition to physical fitness. People who engage in regular exercise have larger brain volumes than those who don’t. And a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9163715/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 58 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that physical activity was linked to a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQ7NTHVXNJDGLFNH3GMZLDXZHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even mild to moderate activity has an effect,” says Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and gerontology at the Keck School of Medicine and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WK23S3PSRJFXVLUFUHSVLN6E5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Of all my patients, those who have very structured and consistent exercise routines are the ones who tend to do the best,” Salinas says. Federal guidelines say older adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week — think speed walking or playing doubles pickleball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ELLJ4BLWXNHA5ABGC5PGKSDESY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your heart healthy.&lt;/b&gt; “Most dementia risk factors are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease,” Schneider says, “which leads to the common aphorism, ‘What’s good for the heart is good for the brain.’” Quitting smoking, losing weight and managing your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol can help reduce your risk of both heart disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URTN746BLBCUNDQQYTTX63YARA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat for your brain.&lt;/b&gt; As people age, healthy eating plans (high in plant-based foods and low in saturated fat) — such as the Mediterranean and DASH diets — have been linked to fewer cognitive lapses and a lower rate of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HQABQ3RX3FEINM7WDFRP5UFZG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, developed more recently, was designed specifically to protect brain health. It combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37133875/" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; found that adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of dementia in middle-aged and older adults. Other research suggests that — for thinking and memory — the MIND diet may be more beneficial than other diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="RT5N6WTOUFCX3FKRA6W5QK43YI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="RT5N6WTOUFCX3FKRA6W5QK43YI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A few more helpful steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X64D5FLJMJCIPIYSN5BJ3C25WA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Emerging research has revealed some factors in addition to exercise and diet that can make a real difference. This is “a tremendously active area of research right now,” says Susan Resnick, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZVIYACVSFE3DN2QE4DZM6JYGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay socially engaged.&lt;/b&gt; Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5653294/" target="_blank"&gt;Research on “super-agers”&lt;/a&gt; — people age 80 and older with the memory ability of those 30 years younger — points to a potential key factor that sets them apart from their peers: satisfying, high-quality relationships. Social contact benefits the brain by building cognitive reserve, promoting healthy behavior, and reducing stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D2F4GEQVTJFXNBLF2QRXMW5AEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Connect to others by joining a group exercise class, staying in touch with loved ones, or volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN4XL5ZJ5RHIHAED5YJN5MJQGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect your hearing and vision.&lt;/b&gt; Hearing loss often goes untreated. But a growing body of evidence shows that as the severity of hearing loss increases, the risk of developing dementia also rises. Similarly, older adults who experience vision loss have an almost 50 percent higher dementia risk. These declines may also mean less activity in certain brain areas — and often less social interaction and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L7I6TIAX5JHYRLJSXG6ZOBVTVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research suggests that older adults may be able to slow cognitive decline by using &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/hearing-aids/buying-guide/" target="_blank"&gt;hearing aids&lt;/a&gt;.

Some listen. Many don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Parker has seen plenty of misinformation and disinformation over the years, she said the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a petri dish there just waiting for that mess to proliferate,” she said in reference to vaccine scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then the right wind came along, and it blew those spores all over the place: the spores of ignorance and misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rekha Lakshmanan observed something similar. She is the chief strategic officer for The Immunization Partnership, a Houston-based nonprofit that aims to eradicate preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She argued that Texas has long been a site of vaccine misinformation. But the pandemic “made the nation catch up with Texas”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False rumours flooded the internet, warning that vaccines could alter DNA or render people infertile. Some conspiracy theories even posited that the vaccine could be used for implanting chips into patients’ bodies for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all vaccine sceptics believe the misinformation. The way Lakshmanan sees it, vaccine hesitancy falls on a continuum. At the far end, there are those who cannot be convinced to get a vaccine, regardless of the data you present. Unfortunately, she said, that’s the loudest group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, others can be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to take a step back and see that there’s a bigger part of that continuum that’s parents, and they just have questions,” Lakshmanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that parents are often sifting through reams of misinformation, trying to understand what is real and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine organisation Children’s Health Defense recently published a website that bore a striking resemblance to materials published by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its site was riddled with disinformation about vaccines. Kennedy, who served as a leader at Children’s Health Defense before joining the government, ultimately ordered the organisation to take the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The challenge with misinformation is that it could look legit,” Lakshmanan said, “which is why we have to approach these conversations with empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes arguments about “parents’ rights”, which she says is entirely misleading. Anti-vaccine leaders like Kennedy have accused the government of forcing vaccination on parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one has ever said we should take away parents’ rights,” Lakshmanan told Al Jazeera. “It’s a red herring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:41:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>‘Worst fears are coming true’ about Trump cabinet member (Hint: It’s not Hegseth) - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90 500w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;quality=90 800w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" alt="HHS Kennedy West Virginia" decoding="async" class="article__image-content"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

NIH-funded study reveals variables, such as poverty and education, that may underpin higher rates of heart disease and its risk factors.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) uncovered higher rates of heart disease and worse heart health affecting adults living in rural communities compared to urban areas and the factors that likely drive these differences. They found adults living in rural areas were more likely than those living in large cities to have heart disease (7% vs. 4%), high blood pressure (37% vs. 31%), high cholesterol (29% vs. 27%), obesity (41% vs. 30%), and diabetes (11% vs. 10%). Across all age groups, the differences in high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes were largest among adults ages 20–39 living in rural areas vs. cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators reviewed data from more than 27,000 adults who participated in the 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2022-nhis.html"&gt;National Health Interview Survey&lt;/a&gt; to understand geographical differences in rates of heart disease and risk factors for conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Since higher rates of heart disease among adults in rural areas compared to cities have been established, they also sought to understand factors driving these variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that factors such as levels of income and education, having enough food to eat, and owning a home mostly explained the higher rates of people in rural areas who had high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Prior &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073510971935079X?via%3Dihub"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also shown how difficult circumstances, such as living in poverty, can affect cardiovascular health, including increasing inflammation in the body. Additionally, having access to healthcare, which is important for overall health, did not factor into these differences. Lifestyle risk factors for heart disease such as smoking and being less active also didn’t explain these differences, although adults living in rural areas were more likely to smoke and be less active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that rates of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease were largest in rural areas compared to cities in the South. Rates of obesity were higher across rural areas throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 60 million U.S. adults live in rural communities, and heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death. In this study, 1 in 7 adults lived in rural areas (counties of less than 50,000 people), 1 in 2 lived in small or medium-sized cities (counties of 50,000 to less than 1 million people), and 1 in 3 lived in large cities (counties of 1 million or more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying factors driving the higher burden of heart disease and risk factors in rural regions remains a critical research priority. The authors note that insights from their study could inform public health efforts and policies to support and improve the cardiovascular health of people — especially younger adults — living in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/eCTi0XSs90G8-zMPPpxrsQ/project-details/10938144#description"&gt;R01HL174549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Oskar Hansson from Lund University, a co-author of the work, said: “There is an urgent need for accurate and cost-effective Alzheimer diagnostics considering that many countries have recently approved the clinical use of amyloid-targeted therapies [such as donanemab and lecanemab].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Plaques of a protein called amyloid beta and the formation of tangles of another protein called tau in the brain are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson and colleagues reported how they found fragments of tau, called eMTBR-tau243, could be detected in blood and correlated with a build-up of tau tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, but not other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team’s analyses, which involved 902 participants, found levels of this tau fragment were elevated in people with Alzheimer’s symptoms who had mild cognitive impairment, and higher again in those with dementia. Levels were not raised in people with cognitive impairments due to other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientifically, these results are very promising and important as this marker performed better than existing tests and the new marker could help track performance of new drugs in trials,” said Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a neurodegeneration expert at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But, she said, it was not a foolproof blood test for Alzheimer’s&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is also not a simple test, rather requiring complex scientific methods only available in specialist laboratories, so this will not be routinely available without further validation and development of cheaper, easier detection,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said eMTBR-tau243 was one of a number of different biomarkers being studied for use in blood tests for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“What’s interesting is that the blood levels of eMTBR-tau243 seem to be linked to a person’s memory and thinking abilities,” she said. “At present, it is not always possible to make a connection between the level of tangles observed with imaging and level of cognitive impairment, but having blood tests that do this will help to monitor diseases like Alzheimer’s in the brain as they progress, and help inform prognosis in future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Another piece of research&lt;/a&gt;, also published in Nature Medicine, has revealed the ratio of two proteins in brain fluid is associated with the degree of cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer’s, independent of levels of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This research, led by scientists in the US, involved samples from 3,397 people across the US, Sweden and Finland, and looked at levels of two proteins – YWHAG and NPTX2 – that are normally found at the junctions, or synapses, between neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team found the ratio of YWHAG:NPTX2 was better able to indicate that people were experiencing cognitive problems than their levels of amyloid beta and tau, and could be used to predict their future cognitive decline and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Tony Wyss-Coray, a co-author of the study from Stanford University, said the results could help identify the best medications for individuals and help design better clinical trials by selecting appropriate participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZW5mNjBjTXEyNjkwVWY2MjZOenllME1DYUJnUFpqbUQwYjgtS2lPN01hWHlPYVg0SnZ5azloNWRzOHRfTnNnekNncWw2ZG9RZ0NTcDAza295REJ3NVJJeDNqbmkxN2ZaSDdaQjJ0QTBUWWlaS3hNbW45TGR0ZU54M1Y2aThlbFlsVWhpclJTcGYzampwbFpUNWtzUWRndy1oZURN</guid></item><item><title>Why Parents of Kids With ADHD Are So Worried Right Now - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTUJ4RkR1anVqeTZXa2pxMGczbXVpS3I4REtnZ180YmpVMnowOS1rem1xaTVSS3QzcHVFN2NnREhPd0w4ODgtZjVXT2Y1SDdCMTQyb21qdWl4RHBjcF9ESUJUZ2hZYjl0dTlCbnVCc3RCWDVsWTAzeFp3WjVUVzBMZGZ2alFkYldjT3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t18jex008sbbm7xb9qdlc4@published"&gt;For a couple of years, the driving forces of grade school—learning and friendships— were out of reach for Grace’s young daughter. The girl, who has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, would walk around the classroom, touching and distracting classmates. When she inevitably got in trouble, the child felt embarrassed and anxious, but it was impossible to control the impulsive behaviors. “She could not function in school, at all,” says Grace, who lives in central Oklahoma and whose last name is being withheld, like those of other parents in this article, to protect her daughter’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tno001k3b72mh9ug9k0@published"&gt;That began to change four years ago when the then-6-year-old started on stimulant medications to control her ADHD symptoms. After trying a few, the family found the right fit, and for the first time, learning and friendships felt like a real possibility for the girl.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001l3b724mjutqn2@published"&gt;Now it feels like the hard-won progress—for the girl and for our national understanding of the roughly 1 in 5 American children with neurodivergence—is at grave risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001m3b7286k1fzku@published"&gt;Underlying the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again campaign, and most particularly a February&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt; executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling out ADHD medications and other commonly prescribed drugs for children as potential “threats,” is the anti-science implication that neurodivergence is a fiction, curable, as suggested in the executive order, with a well-balanced diet and regular exercise. Parts of the order read a lot like &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5164123-robert-kennedy-jr-psychiatric-drugs-children/"&gt;recent declarations &lt;/a&gt;from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., offering another piece of evidence—as if his &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;persistent illusions of a link between vaccines and autism &lt;/a&gt;weren’t enough—that the secretary of health and human services believes that scientists and doctors are hurting rather than helping neurodivergent children. President Donald Trump recently announced that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/parents-educators-worry-as-oversight-of-special-education-is-moved-to-hhs/"&gt;RFK Jr. will oversee special education&lt;/a&gt; for schools, meaning the secretary will now wield enormous influence in how children with disabilities are perceived and treated at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001n3b72sq9ski6z@published"&gt;It’s only in recent decades that it’s been widely understood how rooted the most common neurodivergent conditions like ADHD, autism, and dyslexia are in differences in brain structure or function, or both—and how treatable ADHD, in particular, can be with medications that alter that functioning. “The science of ADHD has shown that it’s a brain-based disorder. It’s not poor discipline; it’s not bad kids,” says Max Wiznitzer, professor of pediatrics and neurology at Case Western Reserve University and co-chair of the professional advisory board of the advocacy organization Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Specifically, for those with ADHD there’s an imbalance in the brain networks associated with attention and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001o3b72dd6n9fr6@published"&gt;To Grace and other parents, the executive order felt like a gut punch, with its implication that bad lifestyle choices can cause ADHD. “It makes me kind of rage honestly,” she says. “If it was that simple to fix without meds, we would have done it. Suggesting that ADHD is a parenting failure rather than a neurological difference is all kinds of messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001p3b72ibhkfw2y@published"&gt;Neurodivergent children are by no means the only group of students with disabilities threatened by the Trump administration’s many wild, devastating actions. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/us/trump-news"&gt;Efforts to destroy&lt;/a&gt; the Department of Education could &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/403596/what-dismantling-the-education-department-means-for-kids-with-disabilities"&gt;decimate services and advocacy&lt;/a&gt; for students with disabilities ranging from deafness and blindness to learning and intellectual disabilities to all manner of neurodivergence, hurting students of color and marginalized children the most. Severe cuts to Medicaid will make it nearly impossible for lower-income families to access vital services and supports, starting at birth when extremely &lt;a href="https://hechingerreport.org/parents-of-premature-babies-struggle-to-get-help-their-children-are-entitled-to/"&gt;premature babies are automatically eligible&lt;/a&gt; for critical therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001q3b729740xwui@published"&gt;Yet it is notably with neurodivergent children, and those with mood disorders like depression, that the country’s leaders appear to be attacking the very essence and scientific understanding of disability. Repeatedly, RFK Jr. suggested before his appointment that children taking illegal narcotics, as well as ones prescribed ADHD stimulants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, could be well-served on “healing camps” or “wellness farms” where they would essentially be reparented—cut off from the corrupting influences of modern life and, it seems, modern medicine. Last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;a recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the Cut, Kennedy claimed on a podcast that these farms could be particularly useful for Black children, saying, “Every Black kid is now just standard put on Adderall, on SSRIs, benzos.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001r3b72bkrr1icj@published"&gt;The executive order singled out ADHD stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall, which aim to increase brain activity in areas related to attention and impulsivity. (Many children also take nonstimulants, which expand the levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that promotes focus and impulse control.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001s3b726obkqfm9@published"&gt;According to the executive order, the steady rise in diagnosis and use of prescription medications for ADHD among children, along with generally high rates of chronic illness and mental health issues, “poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001t3b72nlde6p9k@published"&gt;Yet never once does the order use the words &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;neurodivergent&lt;/em&gt;, instead lumping disabilities like ADHD and autism in with diseases like asthma, Type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver, arguing that they can be addressed with “fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles,” and more steps in that same vein.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001u3b72mbbvw1nd@published"&gt;In other words, the administration, or at least the writers of the executive order, do not appear to understand the distinction between a brain variation (that you are born with) and a disease (which you can, indeed, sometimes develop through an unhealthy lifestyle). Wiznitzer notes that all competent pediatricians “encourage good diet. All of us encourage sleep and a healthy lifestyle. But even if you do that with the ADHD population, there is still going to be ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001v3b72ygjoyyuh@published"&gt;“The core symptoms,” he added, “respond best to medication,” with behavior therapy and classroom strategies also helping. But children with strong hyperactivity in particular, he said, most often need some medication to function effectively in school and in life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001w3b72hxs2f6ui@published"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18794206/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that ADHD medications can even alter some of the brain differences in children with the disorder, although Wiznitzer noted that “medicine is just one portion” of treatment and that expanded access to behavioral therapies and classroom support could help reduce some reliance on pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001x3b728nj6ogue@published"&gt;Yet availability of those therapies and supports—like occupational therapy and staff in schools trained in working with children with disabilities, including neurodivergence—could also become even more restricted. Public school districts across the country already were facing severe budget cuts with the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065"&gt;disappearance of pandemic relief funds&lt;/a&gt;. And now the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/department-education-cuts-expected-huge-impacts-teachers/story?id=119801563"&gt;slash-and-burn upheaval&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Education poses more budgetary uncertainty. While cuts could ultimately affect all students with disabilities, those with more mild to moderate disabilities, including many with ADHD, could feel the impact more quickly as schools strive to protect services for those with the most severe needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001y3b72yzcmwy3j@published"&gt;Children with ADHD are also a (seemingly) unintended target in &lt;a href="https://stateline.org/2025/02/20/gop-led-lawsuit-that-could-dismantle-disability-protections-draws-public-backlash/"&gt;an ongoing lawsuit by the attorney generals in 17 red states&lt;/a&gt; to declare unconstitutional the seminal Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a Civil Rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by recipients of federal funding. (The stated reason for this challenge was the 2024 inclusion under the Biden administration of gender dysphoria as a protected disability. But experts say a conservative push against federalism in favor of greater states’ rights is also likely at play.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001z3b72ah88b6fx@published"&gt;Most children with disabilities get special education services in school through an IEP, or an individualized education program. But &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/crdc-student-disabilities-snapshotpdf-21420.pdf"&gt;more than a million children&lt;/a&gt; who aren’t eligible for an IEP, including countless students with ADHD, get accommodations in school through a 504 plan. In South Carolina, a state that is part of the lawsuit, the attorney general received about 1,000 emails from parents concerned about the possible end of 504 plans, says Mitchell Yell, a professor in special education at the University of South Carolina. “If [the lawsuit] is not thrown out, that would mean a lot of hardship,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnt00203b72zsp97jge@published"&gt;Officials in many of the states have told parents that they are not targeting school 504 plans, but “if Section 504 were declared unconstitutional, it would be catastrophic for people with all types of disabilities,” says Alison Barkoff, a professor at George Washington University, in an email. In regards to potential impact on school 504 plans, she says, “I don’t think they realize they stepped on the mama tiger third rail.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-section-div/instances/cm8t19u04002a3b7201qp7pt4@published" class="section-div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnt00213b72idmzlji3@published"&gt;It took over a century for scientists and doctors to develop a strong understanding of the brain science behind neurodivergence—an understanding that’s still being refined. At the start of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, behaviors that we would now describe as characterizing ADHD, for instance, were referred to as a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258430/"&gt;“defect of moral control,”&lt;/a&gt; according to a 2010 review article on the history of the disorder. Although the subject of morality doesn’t come up in the executive order, there’s an implicit morality policing of parents in the suggestion that the real cure to conditions like anxiety and ADHD lies in healthier meals, less screen time, more outdoor activity—ideas perfectly summed up in the vision of those “wellness camps” RFK Jr. has evoked. “It seems to imply that there is something corrupt about these people,” says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00223b72kb7ku0pg@published"&gt;In the middle of the century, scientists made the connection between ADHD and the brain, writing that hyperactive behavior in children was caused by “damage” to the organ. That link to the brain was developed and refined over the next few decades. And ADHD, so named, first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1987 (for a few years before that, it was ADD with or without hyperactivity; and before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, it was hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood). It wasn’t until the 1990s, though, that doctors came to understand that ADHD is not something that most people necessarily outgrow, says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00233b729zmar4h5@published"&gt;The use of stimulants to treat ADHD—discovered by accident—long predates our contemporary understanding of the condition. But in more recent years, there’s been tremendous progress in refining and diversifying the types of medications available, particularly among the nonstimulant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00243b724glhg7vn@published"&gt;Shanna, a New Jersey mother of a 10-year-old who has ADHD and autism, says that at first she was deeply hesitant about putting her then 6-year-old on medication for ADHD. “I really thought we could control this with behavioral therapy,” Shanna recalls. “I don’t think any parent wants to give their kid medication they will be on for the rest of their life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00253b72a1civqrx@published"&gt;But the child wasn’t progressing academically, even with behavior therapy. At one point, a therapist stood near the child in the classroom and tapped her on the shoulder when she wasn’t paying attention. “What she learned is that she didn’t have to pay attention unless they touched her on the shoulder,” Shanna says. The pediatrician reminded the parents, “She has a chemical imbalance in her brain; she’s not going to outgrow this.” That clinched it.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00263b72j750v0j8@published"&gt;The parents first tried a stimulant medication, which proved disastrous: It didn’t help the inattention and the child lost 10 percent of her body weight. But the family regrouped and tried a nonstimulant that was more effective. Shanna credits the medication with finally giving her daughter the attention span to learn to read. “The differences were so startling,” she says. “It was shocking how well it worked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00273b72xa27xm4t@published"&gt;Parents and pediatricians say no one treatment is a cure-all. Shanna’s daughter continues to receive a variety of in-home therapies for autism and for ADHD. She’s on the same nonstimulant drug she started four years ago. In school, she has several accommodations: Teachers always say the girl’s name first when asking her a question, and she has preferential seating at the front of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00283b72n63usnyu@published"&gt;The family watches the girl’s sleep, activity, and diet closely (they stopped giving her much chocolate years ago, for example, because it made her too excited). But Shanna calls the idea that this monitoring alone—as implied by the executive order—would solve her daughter’s ADHD symptoms “ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00293b72up2pjzib@published"&gt;For most kids with neurodivergence, including Shanna’s daughter, a combination of strategies and therapies is crucial to helping them live their best lives. And the prospect of taking a key treatment away from millions of kids, Wiznitzer says, is “like kicking the chair out from under the &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;child.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gennady Onishchenko, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency TASS: 'In St. Petersburg, we have the Pasteur Institute, which only deals with influenza, and its official report does not contain any information about any new virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, let's not brush this information aside... [but], most likely, there is no virus, let's not hype it up now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No infection control measures are reported to have been taken in Russia, while officials are said to be warning that 'spreading unverified information about public health can lead to unnecessary panic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts outside the country have been unable to verify the reports, but have warned online that the situation in Russia is 'very political'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Sanders, a self-trained disease-tracker who helped track the early days of the Covid pandemic, wrote on her site &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/europe/pneumonia-respiratory-and-influenza-like-illnesses-ili-ac/russia-ad/1010785-russia-mystery-respiratory-virus-reported-in-the-media-gov-suggestion-of-metapneumovirus-march-29-2025"&gt;FluTrackers&lt;/a&gt;: 'Just a reminder... the Russia situation is very political.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50769434" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;slow-wave&lt;/a&gt; and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51106201" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep," Cho said. "That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer's prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer's supports the study's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it's real," said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don't get enough sleep, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lay in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there's an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added nearly five years to a man's life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can't wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can't be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't lose hope. The good news is that you can easily train your brain to better sleep by following what is called "sleep hygiene." It's important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you're falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep," Cho said. "There's no one medicine that improves overall sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="qp_all5451291"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qp_main5451291" fp="93084913-162" results="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long do you typically sleep at night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The effect was linked to dietary tryptophan deficiency, which lowers the production of serotonin—a neurotransmitter known to inhibit sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice that fasted every other day for months displayed significantly higher mating activity, even into old age, despite no improvements in sperm quality or hormone levels. Researchers suggest similar mechanisms may apply to humans, offering potential insights into non-pharmacological treatments for low libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Serotonin = Higher Libido:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting reduced serotonin, releasing behavioral inhibition in male mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased sex drive required fasting for at least 6 weeks, ideally 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to fasting-based treatments for low sexual desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan—an amino acid that must be obtained through food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108300"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a recurring subject of research because reduced food intake and thus calorie restriction has a variety of effects on the organism beyond the commonly observed weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE and lead author of the current study, and his team have also been working on this topic for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in the effects of fasting on aging. Using mice as a model, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms. Our aim is to gain insights that may also be relevant to humans,” says the Bonn-based scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More offspring than expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research results now published are based on a fortuitous discovery, as Ehninger and his colleagues had originally set out to investigate something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to examine how fasting affects the offspring of male mice. However, one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice—senior individuals by human standards—that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals. Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of detective work to uncover the real cause,” says Ehninger, whose research group collaborated on the current study with experts from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led by Prof. Yu Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, we realized: it is a matter of behavior. The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely. In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fasting in a 24-hour rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at two months of age, these male mice were subjected to a specific form of intermittent fasting. Their access to food followed a recurring 24-hour pattern: the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours with access to water only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 22-month fasting regimen, the males were housed together without any contact with females. They were later introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Effect takes time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice. These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females. They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups—both young and old—that fasted for only a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time,” says Zhou. “Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A question of serotonin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of investigating the causes, attention eventually turned to neurotransmitters that influence sexual behavior. Some have a stimulating effect, while others act as inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the sexually active male mice, one factor stood out: serotonin—a chemical messenger generally associated with inhibitory effects—was present at unusually low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited; the usual regulatory restraint was diminished,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter mediating communication between neurons. However, its synthesis depends on the amino acid tryptophan, which must be obtained through the diet or released through the breakdown of the body’s own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid, meaning that neither mice nor humans can synthesize it on their own. As a result, dietary intake plays a key role in regulating tryptophan levels in the body. It is, in fact, found in many common foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting,” explains the DZNE researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the fasting regimen relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All in all, the fasting mice consumed almost 15% fewer calories than the animals in the control group. This also roughly applies to their intake of tryptophan,” says Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it is currently unclear whether the reduction in serotonin levels is linked to our specific feeding regimen or would also occur with other types of fasting. Future studies will need to clarify this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A potential approach for therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chemical messengers also play an important role in regulating sexual behavior in humans. This applies in particular to serotonin,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he points out, this is evident, for example, in the use of SSRIs, a class of antidepressant drugs that increase serotonin levels. A potential side effect of this therapy is reduced libido. Conversely, lower serotonin levels are known to promote sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting—possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ehninger, there are actually only a few scientific studies on the effects of fasting on human libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, it would make sense to investigate this in more detail. I see potential for therapeutic applications. A lack of sexual desire is not necessarily perceived as problematic—but some people suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This condition is known as ‘hypoactive sexual desire disorder’ and particularly affects older adults. Fasting could potentially serve as a useful addition to existing treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and libido research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Ehninger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Ehninger – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.03.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/a&gt;” by Dan Ehninger et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging affects reproductive capabilities in males through physiological and behavioral alterations, including endocrine changes and decreased libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the influence of intermittent fasting (IF) on these aging-related declines, using male C57BL/6J mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed that IF significantly preserved reproductive success in aged mice, not by improving traditional reproductive metrics such as sperm quality or endocrine functions but by enhancing mating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavioral improvement was attributed to IF’s ability to counter age-dependent increases in serotonergic inhibition, primarily through the decreased supply of the serotonin precursor tryptophan from the periphery to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research underscores the potential of dietary interventions like IF in mitigating age-associated declines in male reproductive health and suggests a novel approach to managing conditions related to reduced sexual desire, highlighting the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and reproductive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:07:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9VVXk4RHFxaW1KNjBPR1c5Skt5VC1CcmplalJBaWRzSURnZjFJSTlXSVZoUG5CcHVVcGNnZzFDYWRZNnpGTDdBZVpVUVlBSVl2TzBVNXM2WnBvWmVnazdfbnVLOTRfYmIwNEQ4eDVFT3lENUZhdGROejlCVWVDZ9IBgwFBVV95cUxOYlRidlJQN3I5VWpwU3lKYXhiVlRjNG9zb0V2YlFLb2RPYnpfWjlGaXBvNWR6TThSZzMyVncwOTNEWk9sNWk3UDAxR29faXJicTJsMkE2VnpLVUJOdEJXc3l0MEk0NXpQWi1TYVp1QVJCcXlFUFFsN3JBMGExTTZINkdndw</guid></item><item><title>As avoidable deaths slowed globally, they rose in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPN2g4eWp2SmlwNGVsd013elJjbm9yV2I5WFhXc1I0aTBEbXBBYnRROFpDTGRqYzI4Q012UjZfSU1CQnZ0WnI5cmItTVNMcVdTNWlFMS1ha3pQd25iZnBnbzgzNUczT21TcUpwRnRMQmgwNEN0c25DMW50TmFhU1I0am9XaWtBcF9CYVRnWFlKYlRZOGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="47D2P73BMFCPLCIHJG4RWJWGWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;From 2009 to 2019, avoidable mortality increased by an average of 33 deaths per 100,000 people across the United States, according to an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831735" target="_blank"&gt;article published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJ4FZMAWFJBPDL3WBL4GOVB3HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the same decade that avoidable deaths increased in the United States, they dropped by an average of nearly 23 deaths per 100,000 across all other countries in the study.

Researchers found that older adults with mild cognitive issues performed worse on odor identification and memory tasks than cognitively normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, administered in English and Spanish, was equally effective across language groups and whether or not participants were supervised. These findings support the use of smell tests as a noninvasive screening tool to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases before memory symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At-Home Feasibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants successfully completed the smell test at home without supervision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olfactory-Cognition Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with mild cognitive impairment showed reduced odor memory and identification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Inclusivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Test results were consistent across English- and Spanish-speaking participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to early detection of cognitive impairment, a new study suggests that the nose knows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham developed olfactory tests — in which participants sniff odor labels that have been placed on a card — to assess people’s ability to discriminate, identify, and remember odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108288"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a nose." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team found that odor identification, memory, and discrimination declined with age.

Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early detection of cognitive impairment could help us identify people who are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease and intervene years before memory symptoms begin,” said senior author Mark Albers of the Laboratory of Olfactory Neurotranslation, the McCance Center for Brain Health, Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, and an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our goal has been to develop and validate a cost-effective, noninvasive test that can be performed at home, helping to set the stage for advancing research and treatment for Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albers and colleagues are interested in whether olfactory dysfunction — the sometimes-subtle loss of sense of smell — can serve as an early warning sign for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albers helped found a company that makes the Aromha Brain Health Test, which is the test used by the research team to conduct the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the olfactory test, the team recruited English- and Spanish-speaking participants with subjective cognitive complaints (those with self-reported concerns about memory) and participants with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared these participants’ test results with those from people who had no sense of smell and with cognitively normal individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that odor identification, memory, and discrimination declined with age. They also found that older adults with mild cognitive impairment had lower scores for odor discrimination and identification compared with older adults who were cognitively normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that test results were similar across English- and Spanish-speakers, and participants performed the test equally successfully regardless of whether they were observed by a research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that future studies could incorporate neuropsychological testing and could follow patients over time to see if the tool can predict cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that olfactory testing could be used in clinical research settings in different languages and among older adults to predict neurodegenerative disease and development of clinical symptoms,” said Albers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General Brigham Communications – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92826-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark Albers et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:54:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE0tTDVrYUNsQUR5SGg2c3BFRVBjOTJkV3hlWDB5UTgzbGxoOVFHczNiT1dYQ2lVTlZiY2pNeFFQWlhEc0RkVG5oOVdjaWVaclVLUDhGUGl0VV9iS2xfVE9jRnJTQTExQ1ox</guid></item><item><title>Highly contagious airborne disease outbreak in US sparks travel warning - Daily Express US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBnSWtIZU8yUVFvdV8wTVdPckFrTTNVZ3RfRmNjZlNzeWxPSVdmLVY2ZDN2dFd4QjFmUTZlZ01NQU1vb0ZoNGVfSFZ3cHRsbGFmTXhjVjlXZVM4ZHNkR0JxSVZyc0swcXJwNWtGY09PZEFoU2xQdHfSAXtBVV95cUxNQnh5RUZfNHhLVF9NQWtMNFRuR3IyVFhQWXBJakhfVVFERzMyTWtvdTFzVV9kUTNTbXFFLW45ZlhDRUZYbF93cTYyc0ZJREtDeWhtQ3ZFUXM2R2FMbnhBOXZYckg2VFpBOWhKejRVT1NlMk1DRE81cHFHWVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has sounded the alarm with travel advisories due to &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/167284/washington-DC-measles-case-amtrak"&gt;a surge in cases&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/166912/texas-mom-stands-decision-vaccinate-after-daughter-dies-from-measles"&gt;an airborne virus&lt;/a&gt; across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly contagious disease and &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/164436/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico"&gt;a significant killer of young children worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, is on the rise. The WHO highlighted that the virus spreads through droplets from infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already surpassing last year's figures, the US has confirmed 420 measles cases this year, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/166422/texas-measles-outbreak-reaches-259-unvaccinated"&gt;with a concentration in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; and now seeping into adjacent states, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/highly-contagious-air-borne-disease-34949272"&gt;reports the Daily Star. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston's computational epidemiologist, Benjamin Rader, expressed his concern about the prevalence of measles among those unvaccinated or with uncertain vaccination histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "We are experiencing an extremely concerning decline in measles vaccination in the very group most vulnerable to the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to watch for include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and white spots inside the mouth. A rash typically follows these symptoms, appearing 10-14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe cases of measles can result in pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infections, brain inflammation (encephalitis), blindness, and even death. While there's no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most patients recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radar explained: "The worry is that once measles gains a foothold in the community, it'll transition from isolated outbreaks to an endemic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T MISS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/politics/167411/trump-administration-halts-billion-health-funding" target="_blank" data-name="Trump cuts $12 billion in pandemic funding amid bird flu and measles crisis"&gt;Trump cuts $12 billion in pandemic funding amid bird flu and measles crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/167284/washington-DC-measles-case-amtrak" target="_blank" data-name="DC on alert as highly contagious disease detected in Amtrak passenger"&gt;DC on alert as highly contagious disease detected in Amtrak passenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/166912/texas-mom-stands-decision-vaccinate-after-daughter-dies-from-measles" target="_blank" data-name="Mom of girl who died of measles says 'disease wasn't that bad' as cases rise"&gt;Mom of girl who died of measles says 'disease wasn't that bad' as cases rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO is advising international travelers to ensure their vaccinations against measles are current before traveling, with a particular emphasis on those heading to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization also recommends that residents in U.S. outbreak areas adhere to local health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has issued a statement emphasizing the importance of widespread access to the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Measles" href="/latest/measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to keep general population vaccination rates high and protect individuals at increased risk of exposure, such as healthcare workers and international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization said: "Unvaccinated individuals from areas in the United States experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: "At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has been clear in its stance on vaccination against the virus to halt its spread, stating: "Immunization against measles prevents measles and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:35:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBnSWtIZU8yUVFvdV8wTVdPckFrTTNVZ3RfRmNjZlNzeWxPSVdmLVY2ZDN2dFd4QjFmUTZlZ01NQU1vb0ZoNGVfSFZ3cHRsbGFmTXhjVjlXZVM4ZHNkR0JxSVZyc0swcXJwNWtGY09PZEFoU2xQdHfSAXtBVV95cUxNQnh5RUZfNHhLVF9NQWtMNFRuR3IyVFhQWXBJakhfVVFERzMyTWtvdTFzVV9kUTNTbXFFLW45ZlhDRUZYbF93cTYyc0ZJREtDeWhtQ3ZFUXM2R2FMbnhBOXZYckg2VFpBOWhKejRVT1NlMk1DRE81cHFHWVE</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans − but there are ways to slow down viral evolution - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNLVRaSEdfOVZmbDlkbmtJa1JUTFMwYXgwdW1wTkFBX2g0QjdvOEdKN0p2QzNnM3NLRkNIWWRvQjFYaENkSlp6eFBnVU94UEVySngyUFlPZmNxMWtlc2tkUGc4d3VaWmFDY3l3RVlUSEViX2g3amF4T3NBd2NwMkNFTTkyZklidmZPUE1USVpDZV9PUUI5SkNHOG8yaUsxRS1LVFpLSHlNdmhSVXNfbTVZcF8ySmFrX1Q3X3gyamtxRlkwV3dXLVBmUllNdXNmcVZyRkMxYVpsd1pzT1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disease forecasts are like weather forecasts: We cannot predict the finer details of a particular outbreak or a particular storm, but we can often identify when these threats are emerging and prepare accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viruses that cause avian influenza are potential threats to global health. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-joint-fao-who-woah-assessment-of-recent-influenza-a(h5n1)-virus-events-in-animals-and-people_dec2024"&gt;Recent animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; from a subtype called H5N1 have been especially troubling to scientists. Although human infections from H5N1 have been relatively rare, there have been a &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025.pdf"&gt;little more than 900 known cases globally&lt;/a&gt; since 2003 – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe2416323"&gt;nearly 50% of these cases have been fatal&lt;/a&gt; – a mortality rate about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030"&gt;20 times higher&lt;/a&gt; than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. If the worst of these rare infections ever became common among people, the results could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching potential disease threats from an anthropological perspective, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ron-Barrett-2"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; recently published a book called “&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;Emerging Infections: Three Epidemiological Transitions from Prehistory to the Present&lt;/a&gt;” to examine the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/future-pandemics-will-have-the-same-human-causes-as-ancient-outbreaks-lessons-from-anthropology-can-help-prevent-them-224622"&gt;ways human behaviors have shaped&lt;/a&gt; the evolution of infectious diseases, beginning with their first major emergence in the Neolithic period and continuing for 10,000 years to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from this deep time perspective, it becomes evident that H5N1 is displaying a common pattern of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;stepwise invasion&lt;/a&gt; from animal to human populations. Like many emerging viruses, H5N1 is making incremental evolutionary changes that could allow it to transmit between people. The periods between these evolutionary steps present opportunities to slow this process and possibly avert a global disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spillover and viral chatter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a disease-causing pathogen such as a flu virus is already adapted to infect a particular animal species, it may eventually evolve the ability to infect a new species, such as humans, through a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-spillover-bird-flu-outbreak-underscores-need-for-early-detection-to-prevent-the-next-big-pandemic-200494"&gt;process called spillover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spillover is a tricky enterprise. To be successful, the pathogen must have the right set of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004129"&gt;molecular “keys”&lt;/a&gt; compatible with the host’s molecular “locks” so it can break in and out of host cells and hijack their replication machinery. Because these locks often vary between species, the pathogen may have to try many different keys before it can infect an entirely new host species. For instance, the keys a virus successfully uses to infect chickens and ducks may not work on cattle and humans. And because new keys can be made only through random mutation, the odds of obtaining all the right ones are very slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these evolutionary challenges, it is not surprising that pathogens &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;often get stuck&lt;/a&gt; partway into the spillover process. A new variant of the pathogen might be transmissible from an animal only to a person who is either &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.45"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; due to preexisting illness or more likely to be infected because of extended exposure to the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, the pathogen might not be able to break out of its human host and transmit to another person. This is the current situation with H5N1. For the past year, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;many animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of wild and domestic animals, especially among birds and cattle. But there have also been a small number of human cases, most of which have occurred among &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2414610"&gt;poultry and dairy workers&lt;/a&gt; who worked closely with large numbers of infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654010/original/file-20250309-56-8c7d2b.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Pathogen transmission can be modeled in three stages. In Stage 1, the pathogen can be transmitted only between nonhuman animals. In stage 2, the pathogen can also be transmitted to humans, but it is not yet adapted for human-to-human transmission. In Stage 3, the pathogen is fully capable of human-to-human transmission.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists call this situation &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250012210/theviralstorm/"&gt;viral chatter&lt;/a&gt;: when human infections occur only in small, sporadic outbreaks that appear like the chattering signals of coded radio communications – tiny bursts of unclear information that may add up to a very ominous message. In the case of viral chatter, the message would be a human pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sporadic, individual cases of H5N1 among people suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2024.101416"&gt;human-to-human transmission&lt;/a&gt; may likely occur at some point. But even so, no one knows how long or how many steps it would take for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses evolve rapidly. This is partly because two or more flu varieties can infect the same host simultaneously, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0141"&gt;reshuffle their genetic material with one another&lt;/a&gt; to produce entirely new varieties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654237/original/file-20250310-56-167183.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Genetic reshuffling – aka antigenic shift – between a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza and a strain of human influenza could create a new strain that’s even more infectious among people.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.4062/biomolther.2014.005"&gt;Eunsun Yoo/Biomolecules &amp;amp; Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-NC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reshuffling events are more likely to occur when there is a diverse range of host species. So it is particularly concerning that H5N1 is known to have infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44358-024-00008-7"&gt;at least 450 different animal species&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be long before the viral chatter gives way to larger human epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reshaping the trajectory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that people can take basic measures to slow down the evolution of H5N1 and potentially reduce the lethality of avian influenza should it ever become a common human infection. But governments and businesses will need to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can start by taking better care of food animals. The &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass"&gt;total weight of the world’s poultry&lt;/a&gt; is greater than all wild bird species combined. So it is not surprising that the geography of most &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00699.x"&gt;H5N1 outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; track more closely with large-scale housing and international transfers of live poultry than with the nesting and migration patterns of wild aquatic birds. Reducing these agricultural practices could help curb the evolution and spread of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654011/original/file-20250309-62-t0uaeu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Large-scale commercial transport of domesticated animals is associated with the evolution and spread of new influenza varieties.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/b3nscott/2512789670"&gt;ben/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can also take better care of themselves. At the individual level, most people can vaccinate against the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03721-24"&gt;common, seasonal influenza viruses&lt;/a&gt; that circulate every year. At first glance this practice may not seem connected to the emergence of avian influenza. But in addition to preventing seasonal illness, vaccination against common human varieties of the virus will reduce the odds of it mixing with avian varieties and giving them the traits they need for human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the population level, societies can work together to &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;improve nutrition and sanitation&lt;/a&gt; in the world’s poorest populations. History has shown that better nutrition increases overall resistance to new infections, and better sanitation reduces how much and how often people are exposed to new pathogens. And in today’s interconnected world, the disease problems of any society &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126795"&gt;will eventually spread&lt;/a&gt; to every society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 years, human behaviors have shaped the evolutionary trajectories of infectious diseases. Knowing this, people can reshape these trajectories for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Each individual’s microbial mix affects digestion, immunity, and many other human processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six years, scientists tracked the microbiomes of people ranging from 29 to 75 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They collected samples from the gut, mouth, nose, and skin, observing how these organisms changed during short-term illnesses, chronic conditions, and daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Snyder, Ph.D., from &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and director of the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, led this wide-ranging effort with the late George Weinstock at &lt;a href="https://www.jax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trillions-of-microbes-shape-who-we-are"&gt;Trillions of microbes shape who we are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers confirm that the human microbiome contains about 39 trillion microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results underscore the idea that we each have individualized microbiomes in our bodies that are special to us,” Snyder states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes, diet, and the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-may-be-the-best-strategy-to-boost-your-immune-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; all shape these communities, which vary greatly between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diversity matters for health. Each person’s bacteria respond to internal factors, refuting any notion that everyone shares identical microbial residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators suggest that understanding these differences could open new possibilities for personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-temporary-microbial-changes-observed"&gt;Temporary microbial changes observed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,432 biological samples produced more than 118 million measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists used genetic sequencing to identify microbial populations during routine checkups or unusual events, such as vaccinations or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-increasing-enterococci-looming-global-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xin Zhou, Ph.D., notes, “People with Type 2 diabetes showed a less stable and less diverse microbiome,” hinting that limited variety may connect with certain illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-term infections caused temporary disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that when you get sick with something like a cold, you have this temporary change in the microbiome; it becomes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-could-cause-a-health-crisis-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;very dysregulated&lt;/a&gt;,” Zhou explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With diabetes, that signature is the same in many ways except that it is long-term rather than temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personal-microbes-are-the-most-stable"&gt;Personal microbes are the most stable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finding challenged expectations about which bacteria remain most consistent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people would suspect that the bacteria shared among us would be the most important and thus the most stable. We found the complete opposite – the personal microbiome is the most stable,” Snyder expounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that unique &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/household-plumbing-is-full-of-microbial-communities-that-might-be-a-health-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbial communities&lt;/a&gt; within each person often stay steady despite environmental influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight highlights how individual baselines shape resilience during illness or dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interconnection-across-human-microbiomes"&gt;Interconnection across human microbiomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in the nose, mouth, or skin coincided with changes in the gut, suggesting that these microbes behave like “a single, fluid system,” according to Snyder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain immune proteins in the blood moved in sync with these shifts, indicating strong ties between microbial balance and immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors, including humidity and seasonal effects, influenced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/warming-waters-are-dramatically-changing-microbial-life-in-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbial composition&lt;/a&gt; but could not explain the large differences seen across participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underscores that each person’s body creates a unique habitat for bacteria, making it hard to define a universal standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-the-human-microbiome-matter"&gt;Why does the human microbiome matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists propose that the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-meditation-transforms-gut-microbes-for-optimal-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;composition and stability&lt;/a&gt; of a person’s microbiome may help predict how they respond to illnesses or treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The microbiome varies enormously between people. How you feed it and what it’s exposed to probably makes a big impact on your health, and we still have to work that out in many ways,” Snyder concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights from this work point to individualized strategies that account for specific microbial features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on personal baselines, future research may offer medical guidance tailored to each individual’s microbes, potentially improving &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-term wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolution-of-scientific-understanding"&gt;Evolution of scientific understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in microbes dates back to the late 1600s, when early microscopes revealed tiny organisms in water droplets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, scientists concentrated on harmful bacteria, overlooking beneficial ones. Over time, researchers uncovered the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasa-says-the-international-space-station-is-too-clean-add-microbes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;importance of friendly bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that assist with immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “microbiome” gained traction in the early 2000s, accompanied by growing awareness that these microbial residents are not merely passengers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing projects, including broad genetic investigations, have shown that microbial diversity can shift with diet, medications, and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evolution in understanding has prompted deeper studies into how each person’s bacterial signature may influence everything from metabolism to mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts see ways to use microbiome knowledge in personalized medical plans, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;designing probiotics&lt;/a&gt; or targeted therapies for each person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers suggest that small changes, like altering meal routines, might strengthen bacterial communities that enhance metabolic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others propose monitoring microbial markers to identify subtle shifts before chronic conditions take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to probe how gut microbes connect to the brain through chemical signals, raising questions about links to mental well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators are also examining &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/secrets-of-aging-have-been-found-in-the-skin-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skin microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; to see if they affect issues like dryness or irritation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As methods for genetic analysis improve, more precise mapping of these bacterial populations may offer fresh approaches for supporting long-term health without a one-size-fits-all framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-microbiome-and-future-health"&gt;Human microbiome and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing interest in this field suggests that bacteria can influence nutrient processing. Studies look beyond the gut, revealing microbial identities in body areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variety appears vital, prompting further work on how personal bacterial communities support resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple lifestyle shifts may nurture helpful microbes, guiding approaches that honor each person’s unique health profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these microbial mysteries continue to unfold, it’s clear that our personal armies of bacteria deserve more attention in the pursuit of better, individualized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(24)00056-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Host &amp;amp;

More than four out of 10 people diagnosed are over 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main forms of the disease — non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former accounts for eight in ten cases and is a less aggressive form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas the latter, small-cell lung cancer, is very aggressive and usually spreads faster.

Seasonal allergies are the body’s response to pollen from trees and grass; &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/seasonal-allergies"&gt;the immune system releases chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, like histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which cause all those uncomfortable, familiar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The best way to combat the unpleasant barrage is to get ahead of them, says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/russ-leftwich-md"&gt;Russell Leftwich&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/"&gt;American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology&lt;/a&gt; and an adjunct assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Since allergy season arrives at roughly the same time every year, Leftwich recommends starting your allergy relief of choice for a few days before pollen levels get too high. (The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, and IQAir provide local pollen monitoring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the dizzying variety of drugs at the pharmacy has you confused, here are a few things to know about the most effective types of over-the-counter allergy medications as well as non-pharmaceutical ways to keep your allergies in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="before-heading-to-the-drugstore" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Before heading to the drugstore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the best ways to alleviate allergy symptoms is to prevent pollen from getting into your body in the first place. This means keeping windows closed and wearing a mask while doing yard work, Leftwich says. If you’ve been outdoors for a while, &lt;a href="/even-better/24139229/allergies-seasonal-runny-nose-sneezing-eyes-itchy-watery-snot-relief"&gt;change your clothes and wash your face&lt;/a&gt; when you get home, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/rita-kachru"&gt;Rita Kachru&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of allergy and immunology in the department of medicine at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another prevention method includes rinsing your nose with a saline solution: a mixture of baking soda, salt, and distilled or boiled water, Kachru says. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/saline-sinus-rinse-recipe"&gt;mixing three tablespoons of iodide-free salt&lt;/a&gt; with one teaspoon of baking soda in a small container. Then add one teaspoon of the salt/baking soda mixture to eight ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/saline-spray"&gt;buy nasal saline sprays&lt;/a&gt; at the drugstore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-to-take-antihistamines" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When to take antihistamines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When avoidance strategies aren’t totally effective, you can treat your symptoms with over-the-counter allergy medications. One of the major categories of these treatments are antihistamines, which are available in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/antihistamines"&gt;pill, tablet, eye drop, or nasal spray forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antihistamines help reduce itchiness and sneezing and are your first line of defense, Kachru says. “The reason I always start with an antihistamine is because you may just have a day of a high pollen count,” she says, “and you just need a one-time antihistamine because you’re sneezing and you’re itchy and you’re a little congested.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kachru and Leftwich suggest opting for long-acting antihistamines — like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or fexofenadine (Allegra) — over short-acting ones. People can develop a resistance to short-acting antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), very quickly. Plus, Benadryl often makes people sleepy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Both short- and long-acting antihistamines provide relief within 15 to 30 minutes, Kachru says. Take them at the start of the day before you are exposed to pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For mild nose itchiness and sneezing, an antihistamine nasal spray, like azelastine (Astepro), might work for you. A common side effect is a metallic taste in the back of the throat, Kachru says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-to-try-nasal-steroid-sprays" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When to try nasal steroid sprays&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you’re reaching for an antihistamine three to four times a week, Kachru suggests adding a nasal steroid into the mix. Not only do nasal steroids reduce sneezing and itchiness, but they’ll help with congestion, too. These include fluticasone (Flonase), budesonide (Benacort), triamcinolone (Nasacort), and mometasone (Nasonex). Nasal steroids do take a few days until you feel the full effects, Kachru says, so don’t give up if you don’t feel better right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To properly administer nasal sprays, insert the tip in your nostril and point it toward your ear. A common mistake when using a nasal spray is pointing it straight up your nose. “It goes up their nose, down their throat and does nothing for them,” Kachru says. “Or they stick it inwards into their nose, and then they get nosebleeds. … So you want to always make sure that when you put it in, you point it out towards your ear, spray, sniff in, and then do the alternate nostril.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While not a nasal steroid, Kachru advises against using &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18562-oxymetazoline-nasal-spray"&gt;oxymetazoline (Afrin)&lt;/a&gt;, a nasal spray decongestant. “Patients who use Afrin regularly end up having really, really severe rebound nasal congestion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After a few weeks of daily nasal spray use, you may consider stopping an antihistamine, if you’re taking both. “That’s usually what I tell people to do,” Kachru says. “Eventually just use that antihistamine as needed” because the nasal spray is more effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The protocol Kachru recommends to her patients include a daily nasal rinse and nasal steroid with an antihistamine as needed. With this line of defense, hopefully your allergy season will be a lot less miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNSExjaFlPeTVCWXM3U29CSlhtUUZVWGlUcDEyc1NoVGJ4M1pza2M3M3l6TEhpc1NUUXZGeTUxZFRVTURKUDlmbjFURHV3OFZtc3lWNG5VSFNwZDB1NTJ1a2o5OG55YlBRTFBPYXZwY3BQMnZFdUpTX21pUFF2TlUwSE5SVkppS1dtclZKTkpubzV0dHZha0JCTEZ6ZWgyQQ</guid></item><item><title>Alzheimer’s risk rises when amount of deep sleep falls, study suggests - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1QS0s5Zmh1Q2RPTzFVSEg5R21UUjdoaHdFT0lSY3I1c0thTXhONjEyRExZYUhrRlhqVnFQMU83RnlrWDhDVlFBYXhRTDlpVUVwX0dHLVF6aXJ0QS16Wm1uUXAyc0ZIaEJ5X3k1R2toZERNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Natalia V.

Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in slow-wave and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep,” Cho said. “That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer’s supports the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Lack of deep sleep, where the brain cleans out toxins and sorts memories, can raise the risk of Alzheimer's diseasem according to a new study. - cyano66/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it’s real,” said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation/how-much-sleep" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about seven to eight hours of sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about seven to eight hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt; to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don’t get enough sleep, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cdi/indicator-definitions/sleep.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between 20% and 25%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;between 20% and 25%&lt;/a&gt; of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/baby-sleep/baby-sleep-cycle#:~:text=Newborn%20babies%20spend%20roughly%2050,cycle%20that%20changes%20over%20time." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 50%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about 50%&lt;/a&gt; of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get,” Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lay in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there’s an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/health/sleep-longevity-study-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nearly five years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nearly five years&lt;/a&gt; to a man’s life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can’t wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can’t be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t lose hope. The good news is that you can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:easily train your brain to better sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;easily train your brain to better sleep&lt;/a&gt; by following what is called “sleep hygiene.” It’s important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you’re falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep,” Cho said. “There’s no one medicine that improves overall sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:10:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1QS0s5Zmh1Q2RPTzFVSEg5R21UUjdoaHdFT0lSY3I1c0thTXhONjEyRExZYUhrRlhqVnFQMU83RnlrWDhDVlFBYXhRTDlpVUVwX0dHLVF6aXJ0QS16Wm1uUXAyc0ZIaEJ5X3k1R2toZERNQQ</guid></item><item><title>The 4 Shortfall Nutrients Experts Worry Most About - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNRlhFQWVwOU1fNElobnVKZE9uZUhuSkt0bml2ck5PTXlvMm1YdF9pcnFjQTEtR3V2Nl9aZDFncjMzckJqVGlKRnhLNUE2czE5Q3RKTTBsUVVwRGZ0Qm0ta0h3b01nWEdPMEthNnlFak1HUVVROGlIM2ZfNmpVY0NrcGR5WdIBiAFBVV95cUxNbXpjODRNN3U5a3dvNUlYa295ZGV0Sl85VngxSktqSjA3dkFGSHlmMGVCY2NMd3o1N3JDT0NGQm02YjY1VVpiS2wxZlF4QnpVbEE4UXB0VXNjMXlXRGpBenRMQS0yQ2JvMGNyek5YYWZaY3hNLXU3ZFZtZEdiN2dHVW13SzNpcnVP?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re eating the way most people in America do these days, you’re probably falling short of the vital nutrients you need.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNRlhFQWVwOU1fNElobnVKZE9uZUhuSkt0bml2ck5PTXlvMm1YdF9pcnFjQTEtR3V2Nl9aZDFncjMzckJqVGlKRnhLNUE2czE5Q3RKTTBsUVVwRGZ0Qm0ta0h3b01nWEdPMEthNnlFak1HUVVROGlIM2ZfNmpVY0NrcGR5WdIBiAFBVV95cUxNbXpjODRNN3U5a3dvNUlYa295ZGV0Sl85VngxSktqSjA3dkFGSHlmMGVCY2NMd3o1N3JDT0NGQm02YjY1VVpiS2wxZlF4QnpVbEE4UXB0VXNjMXlXRGpBenRMQS0yQ2JvMGNyek5YYWZaY3hNLXU3ZFZtZEdiN2dHVW13SzNpcnVP</guid></item><item><title>The CDC buried a measles forecast that stressed the need for vaccinations - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQdDQzbTlHUW9pemFXaTFvc2pqeXltbXNFM09uLXc4SGQxSkpVNmZqa3Q5OEU1cVFtaVZ2emo1cFZMclRYY0RvVU1hOW5lTk5LMk82VjRKeGlIRnZNTjdzNHRsZkpRYTloU3VxRDRGeWlxWXpubVNkUmVfQnlsWXl2WFlyYmRxVmfSAX5BVV95cUxORHJXZHBlMVZfbWpRUFAxZEJ5LWxuZVgyYnZwZ1RhQnA3S2hzNGFRdVczZEE1N2FfTDA4OHhXT1B0TG9yblJnZjBJTFNSSTdzemhNSUVEQUlPNnVFLTF2SzZiZE5KZWRMRGtGanQyQ29HY19hbmM2eTNtb0RoSFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00073b6mzer0z4i6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8w98h8r001b3b6ms543q2a1@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00083b6mwi0jvi4d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00093b6m5fbj68o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000a3b6m99umk2r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000b3b6m72h8dovv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000c3b6mddad3wwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000d3b6mgyhnzwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000e3b6m6x0p8ae0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000f3b6mad8c1rzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000g3b6m9856546b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000h3b6mngdfwh2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000i3b6m4albktm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000j3b6mam4ruvvf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000k3b6mo60xaua8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000l3b6m1pwrxjs8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html" target="_blank"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000m3b6mcalm0irp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000n3b6mfpsj9c0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000o3b6mzyzns02f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000p3b6mvaa12lo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000q3b6mwd9oz3p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000r3b6m3y7jqizm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000s3b6mpt6lxnjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000t3b6m12hta2mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" target="_blank"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000u3b6mwhpkavzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000v3b6majninky5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/" target="_blank"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000w3b6m34wu54tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000x3b6mgfh3dkyr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00103b6mvczsn4g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/" target="_blank"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00113b6mzq7hx24m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00123b6mmvew12fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/" target="_blank"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, D.C.

Since getting COVID at the end of 2020, she has been dogged by chronic fatigue and other long-term symptoms that prevent her from working or even walking to the end of her block on most days. Many of her outings involve commuting to doctors’ appointments like this one via Uber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are out, people are excited,” Alisha said. “It's like the whole world is moving and I'm not moving like them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the pandemic first struck New York and the nation, Alisha is one of potentially hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — researchers are unclear exactly how many there are — who are still slowed down by long COVID. Their condition is defined by symptoms that come on after an acute COVID infection and last for at least three months, and sometimes years. Although long COVID is a well-documented phenomenon, there’s still no diagnostic test to confirm its presence, meaning that symptoms are generally self-reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39693079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; reported symptoms is chronic, debilitating fatigue. That’s often paired with a punishing condition known as post-exertional malaise — a crash that comes after too much mental or physical activity. While the risks of severe disease often fall on the very young or very old, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db480.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;people in their 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; are at highest risk for long COVID, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ We have, unfortunately, a large number of patients that cannot work,” and others who are only able to work part-time, said Dr. Fernando Carnavali, medical director of the long COVID clinic at Mount Sinai West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Summers gives Alisha a dose of NAD, a supplement that's supposed to increase her energy. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians at Mount Sinai, NYU Langone and other major medical centers in the city are helping to lead the way in better understanding how long COVID works and which treatments might alleviate symptoms. Hospital-based long COVID centers direct patients to specialists and offer them ways to better manage their symptoms, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39693079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which can include&lt;/a&gt; brain fog, shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations and a range of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even as research advances, there are still competing theories as to the underlying causes, and no federally approved treatments are available. Some patients worry progress will falter under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/trump-administration-shuttering-office-of-long-covid-research-and-practice-00246836" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly eliminating&lt;/a&gt; a federal office dedicated to long COVID and &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/research-funding/NIH-cancels-RECOVER-grants-long/103/web/2025/03" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly terminating&lt;/a&gt; some long COVID research grants, amid broader &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cuts to COVID-related funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ People are desperate for solutions,” Carnavali said, adding that patients often do their own research and experiment with remedies recommended by others online. Carnavali said his role is to help them be more strategic, and to rule out anything that might be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gothamist spoke with 10 New Yorkers with long COVID, all in their late 20s to early 40s. They said they were forced to drastically change their expectations for their careers and lives in New York City, while spending much of their time and money searching for remedies that might offer some relief. Some said they have seen improvements in their symptoms over time and have regained their previous capacity to varying degrees. Others said they are still largely bedbound and need help from spouses or other caregivers to get through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘I was hoping to progress further in my career’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Alisha can’t help but reminisce about what her life was like before long COVID. She pulls up pictures on her phone of her celebrating her 30th birthday with friends, cooking with her mom and hiking with her husband outside the city early in the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ When I think about five years, I just think about how different things would've been if I wasn't sick,” she said. “We planned to have a family. I was hoping to progress further in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Alisha takes 10 to 15 supplements daily — although she’s tried many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While estimates on the number of people with long COVID vary, one &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7350a2.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;large survey&lt;/a&gt; recently published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 6% of adults in New York state were living with long COVID in 2023, similar to the national rate. That amounts to about 500,000 people with long COVID in the five boroughs alone. Of those with long COVID, about 1 in 5 reported that it limited their activities significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said she initially kept working after getting long COVID — typically, from bed because her fatigue was so bad. But at a certain point, she said she had to give it up and go on long-term disability. Now, much of her life is dedicated to managing her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alisha, the worst part of long COVID is the post-exertional malaise, or crash, that can come after extending herself even slightly beyond her limits. Alisha says even something simple, like watching an extra hour of TV, can set her back — a kind of “payback” for having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnavali said one of the most beneficial things he can do for patients with post-exertional malaise is teach them “structured pacing,” a practice of conserving their energy so they don’t crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said learning to pace herself has helped make her days more predictable and improved her quality of life. But, she added, it also meant “shrinking my world really small.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Alisha reclining on her couch at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She can now sometimes manage to go to a coffee shop with her husband on the weekend, or visit with family, but she said she has to save up her energy ahead of time and they always have to drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some New Yorkers with long COVID say they’ve lost friends as they’ve become more limited in what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many physical symptoms associated with long COVID, many patients are also struggling with their mental health and adjusting to having a disability, said Dr. Amanda Johnson, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/after-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AfterCare program&lt;/a&gt; serving long COVID patients at NYC Health and Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By and large, these are patients whose identities were not previously based around being sick, Johnson said, “so this is really challenging for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The search for relief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients who spoke to Gothamist said they’ve tried a wide range of experimental treatments and therapies to find relief, some of which are covered by insurance, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drawer in Alisha’s bedroom is packed full of dietary supplements. She takes 10 to 15 daily — although she’s tried many more. She has also been prescribed some “off-label” medications that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but were approved for a different medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those medications is naltrexone, an injectable drug that’s approved for the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction, but which has been shown to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38267326/#full-view-affiliation-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;help relieve&lt;/a&gt; fatigue and pain for some long COVID patients when prescribed at low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rebecca Summers, Alisha’s primary care doctor, explained that to get a low dose of naltrexone, she has to go to a special compounding pharmacy that makes customized drugs, and it isn’t covered by Alisha’s insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha has also tried alternative therapies, and said she has found the most success with &lt;a href="https://traumahealing.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;somatic experiencing&lt;/a&gt;, a practice Summers offers that seeks to help people identify and relieve the effects of psychological stress and trauma on their bodies. That’s not covered by insurance, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ Nobody really knows how to treat this thing, so you're just trying different healing modalities,” Alisha said. “In the last four years, we've probably spent at least $30,000 to $40,000, if not more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said she has help from her husband, in addition to savings and the income from her long-term disability benefits. But not everyone is in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="streamfield-pull-quote pt-4 pb-3 streamfield-pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="h3"&gt;Nobody really knows how to treat this thing, so you're just trying different healing modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="streamfield-pull-quote-author pb-4 mb-5"&gt;Alisha, long COVID patient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Fioravante, a so-called “long-hauler” in Ridgewood, Queens, is a musician and sex worker. She said some of her care is covered by her Medicaid plan, but she has also turned to GoFundMe and her mom’s church to raise money for testing and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All my extra money goes to medical care,” said Fioravante, 40, adding that she works much less than she did before developing long COVID in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients get better over time — but life might not look exactly like it did before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Erin Durkin stopped working after getting sick in 2022, but said her symptoms have since improved enough to freelance part time. Often, she works lying down because she suffers from heart palpitations when she’s upright, but she said she’s far from bedbound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ I can go out. I can do things. I can walk around. I can take care of myself,” said Durkin, who lives in Jackson Heights, acknowledging that not all long COVID patients can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Durkin is now much more cautious than most New Yorkers when it comes to COVID, out of fear of getting reinfected and making her symptoms worse. She always masks in public and will only eat at a restaurant if there’s outdoor seating, which is becoming harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is help on the way?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are no FDA-approved treatments for long COVID yet, Brooklynite Hannah Davis said she is encouraged by the fact that there is now widespread recognition of long COVID within the medical community and a rapidly growing body of research on how it affects the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said she worries about the potential impact of Trump’s cuts to scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis, 37, first developed symptoms of long COVID after catching the virus in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic in New York. She is one of the cofounders of Patient-Led Research Collaborative, which published early findings on the symptoms associated with long COVID after surveying hundreds of people online. The group has since advocated to advance research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ The thing we really need to be doing now is increasing clinical trials,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RECOVER Initiative, a $1.6 billion long COVID research effort funded by the National Institutes of Health, has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5199994/long-covid-patients-nih-research-treatments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;faced criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some patients for being slow to enroll people in clinical trials. But according to the RECOVER website, &lt;a href="https://trials.recovercovid.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight trials&lt;/a&gt; are now being funded that examine 13 possible treatments and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many long COVID patients also receive other diagnoses that align with their particular symptoms, and some researchers say ongoing studies on those medical conditions could also benefit long COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on Friday on which long COVID-related studies have been affected by recent cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago," HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; to NBC last week on the administration's decision to deprioritize COVID generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration is also eliminating the federal Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which coordinates efforts across federal agencies, according to Politico. And last month, HHS was ordered to dismantle its Advisory Committee on Long COVID, made up of volunteer scientists, advocates and health practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, patients like Alisha say they are doing whatever they can to find some peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha and her husband moved to their current apartment, just a couple of blocks from Prospect Park, in 2023 in hopes the urban oasis would be accessible to her — but she’s yet to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one of her goals this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOX3BMRXFaQzdxemlFZTVyNGRzamZQVHgxNkN5Yk5tcnhfY0d3WDZWc3lhdDg3U0xJN2EwTDQxZ0tWaXRJSEJnOWRfY0ttU3pybGdxTDVzUHR5aVFQU3Q4RkZuNnE4Y1JlbFdremFzSF9QeUxhQ1hnVzJEenhvM2szRTd5R0JTMGozWWRWTUU0ZXZKdERXUHVtR25WUUduMDJ2N2JZ</guid></item><item><title>Two spice rack herbs could reverse Alzheimer's Disease and might help diabetes and heart disease - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQZUNqM0Y0SXlLTmJhWUE0cUdSam45V2k3alV6cFpyVXFXSkRPS0VDVWV6OTAwLW5xUkNoRFh1X0ZKd0xIVENBQm85T01iZExwNzVKS0dGRmhLX1FBaXRhWXN6OXlXWVg5cEZHc3FKSzZyLVVaUFdlc0dGcU9MdUIzQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The herb rosemary has long been linked with memory. Going back as far as Shakespeare's Hamlet Ophelia says.: “There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now researchers have discovered a compound found in rosemary - and in its fellow herb sage - could hold the key to reversing Alzheimer's Disease. Carnosic acid is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that works by activating enzymes that make up the body’s natural defence system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pure carnosic acid however is too unstable to be used as a drug. But now a team of scientists from Scripps Research Institute in Calafornia have now synthesised a stable form - diAcCA - which is fully converted to carnosic acid in the gut before being absorbed into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The research, published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; showed that when diAcCA was used to treat mice, it achieved therapeutic doses of carnosic acid in the brain and led to enhanced memory. It also restored nerve connections which could help counteract the progression of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Scripps team concluded: "Collectively, these findings underscore the promise of diAcCA as a potential therapeutic for human Alzheimer's Disease." While the trials have been done in mice the compound is considered safe for humans which means the team is calling for testing on people to be "expedited".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; there are more than 944,000 people in the UK who have some form of dementia. One in 11 people over the age of 65 have dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people with dementia in the UK will be more than 1 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show "dementia and Alzheimer’s disease" were the leading cause of death in the UK in 2022. Collectively they accounted for 65,967 deaths (11.4% of the total), up from 61,250 (10.4%) in 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously found brain inflammation us linked with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2012, a study funded by Alzheimer’s Research UK found a mutation in a gene called TREM2 could increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the TREM2 gene makes a protein heavily involved in regulating the brain’s inflammatory response, scientists suggested that inflammation might in fact play a role in the very initial stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the Scripps team is hopeful their new drug will not only save lives but improve them. And it is hoped the drug will not have any major side-effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The study explained it had previously been difficult to use carsonic acid as a drug or supplement because of the instability of the compound. However the team had created a derivative of it which could reach the gut before breaking down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said this meant the mice absorbed 20% more carsonic acid that they would have done by trying to ingest it in it pure form. It also meant more of the compound was able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and treat the brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysis of tissue samples showed the drug also markedly decreased inflammation in the brain. The unique drug is activated by the very inflammation that it then combats and thus is only active in areas of the brain undergoing inflammatory damage and limiting the potential side effects of carnosic acid, which is on the US Food and Drug Administration’s “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) list, easing the way for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Senior author and professor &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/lipton/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Stuart Lipton&lt;/a&gt; said the team treated the mice with the compound over the course of three months. The group examined the mice by testing their spatial learning and memory in behavioural tests and then analyzing brain tissue under the microscope. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug. And it didn’t just slow down the decline; it improved virtually back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to reducing inflammation in the brain, the scientists found it even "soothed baseline inflammation in the oesophagus and stomach as it was converted to carnosic acid". Prof Lipton sees a potential for diAcCA to work in tandem with Alzheimer’s treatments currently on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also hoped diAcCA can be fast-tracked through clinical trials because of its safety profile.

While the drug has been a powerful tool to contain the virus, inequities remain in accessing those drugs and sustaining a daily treatment. Despite major progress, there are still 30,000 new infections each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many of the terminated HIV-related studies focused on improving access to drugs like PrEP in communities that have higher rates of infections – including trans women and Black men. One of Marcus’s projects was examining whether making PrEP available over the counter would increase the use of the drug in vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The research has to focus on the populations that are most affected in order to have an impact and be relevant,” said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yet, this may be the justification for defunding so many HIV-related studies. A termination letter reviewed by the Guardian dated 20 March cited that “so-called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) studies are often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Scrapping an entire category of disease from research will have innumerable downstream effects on the rest of healthcare&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Erin Kahle, University of Michigan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; did not expand on why the grants were terminated in response to questions from the Guardian.

We remain dedicated to restoring our agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many researchers were left stunned by the scale of the cancellations since in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address-2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in his State of the Union address a commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the country over the next 10 years. As part of this initiative, his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; negotiated a deal with drug companies to provide free PrEP for 200,000 low-income patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach,” said Trump in his address. “Together we will defeat Aids in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Aid cuts predicted to cause 2.9 million more HIV-related deaths by 2030 – study","elementId":"8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/26/aid-cuts-pepfar-epidemic-prediction-cause-29-million-more-hiv-related-deaths-by-2030-lancet-study"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Amy Nunn, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she had even tailored grant proposals to fit the policy goals of the initiative, which included geographically targeting HIV prevention efforts. One of her studies that was terminated last week focused on closing disparities of PrEP use among African American men in Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They finally adopted those policies at the federal level,” Nunn said, noting that Trump was the first president to make ending the epidemic a priority. “Now they’re undercutting their own successes. It’s so strange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The total amount of NIH funds allocated to supporting the 65 grants was $35m. Canceling the grants will not recoup all of that money for the administration, since many are years into their work. Some are even already finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nathaniel Albright learned last Tuesday that an NIH grant supporting his doctoral research was cancelled even though his project had already been completed. A PhD candidate at Ohio State University, Albright is defending his dissertation at the end of the month. Still, Albright is concerned how the cuts impact the future of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s created an environment in academia where my research trajectory is now considered high risk to institutions,” said Albright, who is currently struggling to find postdoctorate positions at universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Pamina Gorbach, an epidemiologist who teaches at University of California, Los Angeles, had been following hundreds of men living with HIV in Los Angeles for 10 years to learn their needs. She had been awarded an NIH grant to better facilitate their treatment through a local clinic. Her funding was cancelled last week as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s really devastating,” said Gorbach. “If you’re living with HIV and you’re not on meds, you know what happens?

Others agreed one immediate concern was how to pay their research staff, since the funds from a grant are immediately frozen once it is terminated.

It’s been obvious with my dad for decades—jobs lost, depression, emotional issues and fights, and an insistence on drinking an enormous amount daily, even after a heart attack and other health issues. I found out later with my mom and it made a lot of things make a lot more sense—secret drinking, and going from acting normal to making no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9blkd001b3b73ya1viwyn@published"&gt;My dad can say that he knows they drink more than they should but the word &lt;em&gt;alcoholic&lt;/em&gt; is a no go (he doesn’t drink during the day, etc.) and neither is the idea of actually stopping. There are close members of both families who have had problems with alcohol, but it’s generally talked about as a foreign, kind of shocking issue, separate from our immediate family. They are both older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001t3b73vo8tqzuo@published"&gt;Before we begin my suggestions, let me say this: This stinks—for you and them. There are all sorts of unwinnable scenarios here on both sides, but you sound like you’re the only one willing to admit there is a problem. I recognize by some of the language you’re using here that you’re probably fully fluent in the Alcoholics Anonymous program, so I won’t belabor your “not your job to fix this” realization, but let’s have those good Al-Anon vibes thrumming in the background throughout this column, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001u3b73bw76z3lf@published"&gt;Here’s my personal experience: My parents don’t qualify as alcoholics but do qualify as untreated Al-Anons (both of their families had a long history of drug and alcohol problems, especially on my mother’s side, which they haven’t worked through). As such, they’re masters of both denial and gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001v3b7321u7y10y@published"&gt;Navigating their lies, evasion, and obstinance were major obstacles for my sister and me growing up and into adulthood. They were at their worst in the past decade as my father’s cognitive decline due to dementia intersected with my mother’s cancer treatments. He insisted he was her best caregiver even though it was clear that it was a disastrous decision for him to be in charge of things. He had trouble making her appointments on time, keeping up with her meds, and communicating with her medical team. Even her oncologist was fed up and angrily called me to suggest that hospice would be the only option if someone didn’t stop my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001w3b732cdkf2mc@published"&gt;We wanted to help and do what was best, but they simply would not let us in in any meaningful way. My mother insisted that my father was doing a great job. She said that the oncologist was “crazy” and that I was out of line for discussing her private medical issues. Their short-term solution was to find a new oncologist so they could continue to avoid any disruptions to their lives, or have to think about pursuing uncomfortable solutions (even if continuing to avoid those solutions could result in one or both of their deaths). I could go into so much detail about how bad it got—we’re talking lawyers and cops and periods of estrangement—but that would only cause me agitation and result in an &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest–&lt;/em&gt;ian&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;word count.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001x3b73y9z1nqqy@published"&gt;The hardest part about having parents who are unwilling to accept help is that it felt like a cruel rejection. I’ve gone through many rejections in my life —professional, romantic, as a prospective rescue pet owner—but the yearslong saga of my mother and father being openly hostile and unwilling to accept my help cut differently. It wasn’t just about the help. All sorts of emotional baggage bubbled to the surface—I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; they didn’t love me!&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001y3b734s7ewutn@published"&gt;It is a great injustice that no one tells us when we are young: When our parents grow old, they will sometimes cause us more distress than we have ever caused them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001z3b73zzrp2fvj@published"&gt;Fast forward to now. My father died a couple years ago. Due to my father’s erratic spending during the period when she was sick and he was cognitively declining, their once-comfortable financial situation is now severely depleted. Still, my mother resides in a pricey assisted living facility where she’s lived for years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht00203b73frqu14f0@published"&gt;According to their money manager, her savings can cover three more years of living there. Given her track record of remarkable resilience, she has the potential to live another 15. If she does live that long, I don’t think she’s up for driving for Uber between naps to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht00213b73ryiytj6w@published"&gt;When I first heard about her finances, I immediately went to the emotional place where you are. First stop: Angry Town. Then, Sad City. That’s when I knew that I needed help. Before I brought it up to her, I consulted my therapist, my sister, my aunt, my wife, and my Al-Anon fellowship about how I should proceed. Through all those conversations, I finally landed on the best approach: wait until the moment is right. I knew it would come eventually, but it couldn’t begin with me inviting her into a hard conversation. She’d recognize the tone, get annoyed, and then I’d get mad. Then we’d have the same conversation again next year and probably have the same result. The best thing for me to do was keep my contact to a minimum, be there when something big and dramatic happens, and then go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihu00223b73myfpzajc@published"&gt;Finally, a few days ago, it came up. She called to speak to her grandchildren and after that was over we began to talk about her health and some of the costs associated with her next cancer screening—the copays were expensive and hinted that she may not be able to afford another bout with cancer. Then I gave her the news about how much longer she could afford to live at her facility, and I calmly relayed to my mother that she was running out of money. I added that whatever she wanted to do, I’d be happy to help her work through it. I can’t afford to pay her rent, but I offered to let her live with us or help her find a cheaper place. I told her I preferred we start planning before she gets evicted.&lt;/p&gt;

I know you want to talk to your parents about how their denial has affected you over the years, but maybe I’d avoid it. I remember how it felt when my parents would try to urge me to get some help with drugs and alcohol by explaining how much it hurt them—or worse, how they were ashamed of me—and that approach never worked. I certainly wasn’t going to stop my drinking and drug use because it made them feel bad. I mean—it made &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel good. It made me feel normal. I knew no other way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihu00253b73uakxop16@published"&gt;But on that note, it’s entirely reasonable that you ask them to not be drunk and disruptive while they’re visiting you and your kids. (I addressed a similar situation about setting these types of boundaries with a reader about&lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/12/parenting-advice-my-daughters-auntie-makes-poor-choices.html"&gt; their friend’s drug use around their child&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

But in the meantime, let’s find a more peaceful way to exist with them. Line up a solid group of sponsors, friends, and relatives who can listen and guide you through your emotional responses. Before your parents come over to your house—call one of them. Before you decide on a dramatic course of action—call one of them. Write dozens of emails to your parents—but never send them. Then call one of them. Ask them how they’re doing. On your boundaries, be clear, firm, and kind—let them know you are truly happy to have them over and serve them seltzers with lime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From differences at the cellular level of the heart to circulatory structure to symptoms of distress and treatment, researchers are finding new manifestations of gender differences in cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;look different in women&lt;/a&gt; than in stereotypically chest-clutching men, sending more diffuse pain shooting through the jaw, neck, arm, back, stomach, and more, all in ways that don’t scream “call 911.” Even where in the body a heart attack blocks blood flow is different: Microvessels in women get jammed, but it’s the larger arteries in men that starve the heart of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number and function of muscle cells in the heart differ, too. Women’s hearts have more cardiomyocytes than men, and their fuel tends to be more fatty acids as opposed to the sugars that male muscle cells prefer to burn, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071973" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reveals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All these differences have implications for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet it is not lost on researchers that the nuances of women’s physiology have taken decades to be uncovered, and that now, any research on gender differences faces &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/nih-puts-former-sexual-and-gender-minority-office-employees-on-administrative-leave/"&gt;special scrutiny or roadblocks by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I think part of the reason, perhaps, that we don’t have the studies in sex differences or cardiovascular disease in women is because there aren’t enough women researchers and women in leadership,” said Esther Kim, director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health, Atrium Health, and professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. She was chair of an American Heart Association writing group that earlier this month issued a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001310" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scientific statement&lt;/a&gt; on sex differences in peripheral vascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That statement has long been in the works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was not some sort of rush job in response to the current administration at all. It’s unfortunate that we have to think about things like that even when this goes out,” she said. “But, you know, it’s science. Women deserve better and women deserve more.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a moment when research into women’s health is under threat in the United States as a casualty of outlawed diversity efforts, learning more about the basic biology and the clinical outcomes of disease takes on more urgency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sex and gender should not just be a niche specialist area of science, but something that all scientists who study animals or humans or cells have to consider,” Madeline Wood Alexander, a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Research Institute whose &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/05/alzheimers-dementia-in-women-explored-special-edition-health-journal-science/"&gt;paper was recently published in a special issue of Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; exploring women’s health. “In the current political climate, we need to be doing better, and to be a good scientist is to consider all of the factors that contribute to health and disease outcomes. And really, the bare minimum is considering sex differences in 50% of the population that has been historically understudied.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying that half of the population means unraveling societal influences as well as more basic variations under the microscope that may exist along with broader influences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we think about male-female differences in, for example, heart disease, we can quite rightly focus on things like access to care and differences in symptoms and issues of health equity,” said David Page, member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT professor of biology. “I don’t mean to deny the relevance of any of those. I mean to add another consideration: There can exist fundamental biochemical or molecular differences between male and female cells of the same type and tissues of the same type prior to any disease process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vascular-variance"&gt;Vascular variance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence has built in recent years of significant gender differences in how vascular diseases strike the blood vessels, from risk factors to diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The need to better recognize those variations led to the new American Heart Association guidelines delineating what is and isn’t the same in diseases cropping up in the peripheral arteries, including the aorta and its branch vessels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TV commercials hammer us about heart attacks and strokes, said Kim, who is also director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in Charlotte, N.C. But few ads talk about aneurysm rupture (when a weakened blood vessel bursts open) or claudication (the cramping leg pain caused by narrowed arteries). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worse for women looking for a solution to their vascular pain. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peripheral vascular disease: &lt;/strong&gt;“Patients may present in a, quote, atypical manner, compared to the man,” said Kim. “It’s not the classic leg pain when you walk that goes away with rest that we learn in medical school. It could be pain at rest. It could be pain that occurs with exertion, but we can work through it. And that may be different than in men.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If their subtle or “atypical” symptoms are missed or diagnosed only after a delay, women can miss out on treatment and fare worse, only able to walk more slowly and for shorter distances. In another disparity, a Black woman’s lifetime risk of 27.6% is higher than a white woman’s risk of 19%, yet chances are lower for a Black woman to receive recommended treatment, the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001251" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AHA determined in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diseases affecting the aorta&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s the largest artery in the body and the one that delivers blood from the heart to the body. For aortic diseases, women are diagnosed later in life and at a more severe stage of disease. While estrogen protects the aorta from aneurysms, when one occurs it’s more severe than in men. Ruptures are three times more likely in women with an aneurysm the same size as a man’s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a woman is treated with a minimally invasive procedure, her chances of dying or having a stroke are higher. Screening guidelines for aortic aneurysms recommend lower repair thresholds for women than for men, but these thresholds may not fully reflect women’s unique risk factors, the AHA statement says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carotid artery disease:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the blood vessel snaking up your neck to the brain. When its walls are blocked by fatty plaque, it can lead to a stroke, but treatment options and outcomes are different for men and women. Preeclampsia, which is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy, as well as older age at menopause and estrogen therapy are risk factors for women. But studies have shown that men have bleeding with these fatty deposits at higher rates than women, elevating the stroke risk for men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vasculitis:&lt;/strong&gt; An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the blood vessels, vasculitis has different types with different effects at different ages. Like other autoimmune diseases, it occurs more frequently in women. Some types have higher mortality rates in women as well as more treatment challenges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zooming-in-on-chromosomes"&gt;Zooming in on chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page’s research goes right to the heart of sex differences: our X and Y chromosomes, plus their underappreciated “inactive” versions. Some sex differences are biologically hard-wired, and Page would argue that male-female differences in health and disease will ultimately find their origins in the sex chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While X and Y chromosomes may matter the most in the reproductive organs, their activity diverges elsewhere in the body. We all learned in science class that males have one X and one Y chromosome while females have two X chromosomes. It’s been assumed that the Y is less important and the second X, called Xi, is inactive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not so. That Xi has to be prepared to support pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And both X chromosomes matter in the heart. For starters, there are proportionally more cardiomyocytes — what Page calls the hardest-working cells in the body — in the female heart compared to male hearts. During pregnancy, the heart works 50% harder to keep blood circulating. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Pumping is important not only in pregnancy but also in end-stage heart disease. Page calls heart failure an energy crisis: The heart is pumping inefficiently and can’t generate enough energy to meet the body’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart failure plays out differently, too. Men are diagnosed with the disorder much more frequently and die more often and earlier than women. Page led a team that discovered male and female hearts have a basic biochemical difference in their power source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re essentially reporting that in the central engine room, the female cardiomyocytes prefer to burn fatty acids a bit more than do male cardiomyocytes, which might be a little more inclined to burning sugar,” he said about a research paper &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071973" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in February in Circulation&lt;/a&gt;. “So it’s as if we’re pointing to a difference in the fuel mix.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That difference could potentially lead to better prevention and treatment for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zooming-out-to-post-operative-care"&gt;Zooming out to post-operative care&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, researchers reported on a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/16/women-survival-cardiovascular-surgery-complications/"&gt;“failure to rescue,”&lt;/a&gt; when a patient dies from complications after surgery that might have been averted if recognized and treated. Differences between male and female patients may explain why women are less likely to survive high-risk cardiovascular surgery than men, the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2024.4574?guestAccessKey=cfdcf654-1f12-478b-87e6-7928faf2dc83&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101624" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Surgery&lt;/a&gt; paper concluded.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After four common but serious procedures —  abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass surgery, or aortic or mitral valve replacements — female patients later developed complications at the same rate as men. But these women were more likely to die within 30 days than men with the same serious post-op problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do suspect that one of the key reasons is that the diagnostic algorithms in the treatment for their complications are the same for men and women, but they should not be the same,” said Mario Gaudino, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who studies cardiac surgery outcomes and who was not involved in the study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts traced the disparate outcomes back to whether a woman was diagnosed late in her disease. Being smaller with smaller blood vessels could make surgery take more time and recovery more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-now"&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association’s Kim takes the long view as she calls for more attention to the women-aren’t-just-small-men conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before you fix something, you have to figure out what the problem is and the scope of the problem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, she zeroed in on three areas of need in her field. One is medical education. In cardiology training, new M.D.s don’t learn as much about vascular disease as cardiac disease. “We’ll know how to order stress tests, echos, EKGs, etc., but we’re also supposed to know how to interpret an ankle brachial index,” which compares blood pressure in the ankle to blood pressure in the arm in order to detect blockages in the legs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another gap is inclusion of women in clinical trials testing devices designed to repair vascular problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We definitely have different anatomy. Our vessels are smaller. Women tend to present with more severe disease,” Kim said. “In these device trials, including in aneurysm trials, we’ve shown that compared to the prevalence, women are underrepresented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s screening of patients to spot trouble early enough to treat it — and determining if that’s the best course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For aneurysmal disease in particular, there’s still a little bit of clarification that needs to come in regards to when should a woman get an aneurysm fixed,” she said about the size of the aneurysm. “Because we tend to be shorter, our aortas are smaller. Should we really wait until 5 and a half centimeters? You know, my aorta is a lot smaller than Shaquille O’Neal’s.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet"&gt;around 5%-10% of all Alzheimer's cases&lt;/a&gt; occur in people under the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/younger-early-onset"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; progresses more rapidly and often strikes people in the prime of their lives. Treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But new data from a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2825%2900024-9/abstract"&gt;recent clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a previously discontinued experimental drug, called gantenerumab, could help. The study found that gantenerumab reduced the buildup of amyloid plaques – one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease – in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may help slow cognitive decline in people with early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is often linked to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5871104/"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; in three specific genes. These mutations cause the brain to produce excessive amounts of amyloid beta, a protein that clumps together to form plaques. These plaques disrupt brain function, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's advances quickly – and the rapid decline is devastating. That's why researchers are racing to find treatments that can slow the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid plaques (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; was a randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate gantenerumab's effects on people with early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers monitored changes in the participants' cognitive abilities, and also used brain imaging and blood biomarkers (the presence of specific proteins in the blood which are linked to Alzheimer's), to track the disease's progress throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial included 73 participants with rare inherited genetic mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's. These participants were either asymptomatic or had mild Alzheimer's symptoms at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were intriguing. In a subgroup of 22 participants, who hadn't had any cognitive issues at the start of the study, taking the treatment for an average of eight years reduced the risk of developing symptoms from a nearly 100% likelihood, to 50%. Brain scans also showed a notable decrease in amyloid buildup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immune defenders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/gantenerumab"&gt;Gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt; is a monoclonal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; – a lab-engineered protein designed to attach to amyloid beta in the brain. By binding to these plaques, it signals the immune system to clear them away. This may potentially slow Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug works by engaging &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22613055/"&gt;microglial cells&lt;/a&gt;. These are the brain's primary immune defenders. Microglia constantly monitor the brain for damage and remove harmful substances, including amyloid beta. However, in people with Alzheimer's disease, microglia often &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00435-y"&gt;fail to clear plaques efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gantenerumab enhances this natural defence mechanism by tagging amyloid plaques, making them easier for the microglia to recognise and break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid beta is thought to play a central role in Alzheimer's by triggering inflammation, interfering with cell communication and ultimately killing neurons. By removing these plaques, gantenerumab may help to protect brain function. However, it doesn't reverse existing damage – which is why early intervention is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of gantenerumab is that it can cross the &lt;a href="https://fluidsbarrierscns.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12987-020-00230-3"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; – the protective shield that blocks many drugs and harmful substances from reaching the brain. This allows it to act directly on amyloid plaques, making it more effective than some earlier treatments that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2756824/"&gt;struggled with drug delivery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as promising as these results are, gantenerumab isn't without risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major concern is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10629981/"&gt;amyloid-related imaging abnormalities&lt;/a&gt;. These are swelling or small spots of bleeding in the brain that show up on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans. This is a common side-effect of amyloid-targeting therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this latest trial, 53% of participants experienced these amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, including small brain bleeds in 27% of participants, brain swelling in 30% of participants and iron deposits from bleeding in 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no participants had major brain haemorrhages or died from the treatment, these side-effects remain a serious concern – requiring regular monitoring through brain scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the modest cognitive benefit observed in the trial. While gantenerumab reduced amyloid plaques, the extent to which this translates into meaningful improvements in memory and thinking skills remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gantenerumab is also expensive to manufacture, which could make widespread access difficult if it gains regulatory approval. As this is an experimental drug, we do not currently know how much it would cost. But other similar anti-amyloid therapies, such as donanemab, currently cost around &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e7pllez0xo"&gt;£25,000 per patient per year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also had a small sample size and only focused on a rare genetic form of early-onset Alzheimer's. More research is needed to see how these results may apply to the wider dementia community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future of treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the trial was terminated early after the study's sponsor pulled out, these findings contribute to the ongoing debate over the causes of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain is the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. Clearing these plaques will slow the disease's progression. The success of the Alzheimer's drugs &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/lecanemab-leqembi"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/donanemab"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt; and now gantenerumab, lend themselves to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study also underscores the importance of early diagnosis. Amyloid-targeting therapies appear to work best in the early stages of Alzheimer's, before &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00756-8#:%7E:text=Clinical%20trials%20generally%20enrol%20early,before%20the%20disease%20takes%20hold."&gt;significant brain damage occurs&lt;/a&gt;. Advances in biomarker testing – including &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/uk-wide-study-into-dementia-blood-tests-recruits-first-participants/"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; and brain scans – could help identify at-risk people sooner. This would improve the effectiveness of drugs such as gantenerumab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gantenerumab is not a cure and &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimer-europe.org/news/roche-discontinues-clinical-trials-gantenerumab-after-graduate-studies-fail-meet-their-primary?language_content_entity=en"&gt;was discontinued&lt;/a&gt; by its manufacturer in 2022 because it failed to demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, this new data could perhaps lead to gantenerumab being manufactured again. It also represents another step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's research is advancing faster than ever before. Whether a success or a setback, each new study adds to our understanding of the disease and brings us closer to more effective treatments. For now, the gantenerumab trial offers a hopeful sign that scientists are making progress in slowing the course of this devastating condition.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253049/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 6-7
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight. You will walk away with a 17-page report detailing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts will review the results of the scan with you, correlate its findings with your health history. This provides a tremendous amount of information allowing him to make valuable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be able to fill out a proprietary survey that will give you insight into health issues that likely compromise your weight loss efforts.

			&lt;p&gt;Cases of the fungal infection &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_auris"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are rising rapidly and coming from more sources too, a new US study reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; was first reported in the US &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-drug-resistant-fungus-has-arrived-in-the-us"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and is considered an "urgent antimicrobial resistance threat" in hospitals, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a large health system in Miami, Florida, the new research found that reported clinical cases had risen from 5 in 2019 to 115 in 2023 – a considerable jump of 2,200 percent in four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consistent with US national trends, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rapidly spread in our community as noted by a sharp increase in the identification of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; from clinical cultures in 2020 and 2021, followed by a less steep rise in 2022 and 2023," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the US team in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many strains of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genome-study-reveals-this-deadly-fungus-has-been-having-sneaky-sex"&gt;don't respond to regular treatments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;and are resistant&lt;/a&gt; to common cleaners and disinfectants too. The fungus spreads quickly in hospitals, often via equipment like catheters and breathing and feeding tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AkI5NeD4Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it takes hold, a &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infection can cause various serious &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65055878"&gt;and even fatal illnesses&lt;/a&gt; in the bloodstream, the respiratory system, the central nervous system, in organs, and in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus doesn't pose much risk to the general public. Most healthy people are unlikely to pick up an infection as they're less exposed to C. auris, and their bodies are better able to repel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for people who are already ill and in the hospital, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fungal-pathogens-are-mutating-dangerously-as-the-world-gets-hotter"&gt;growing threat&lt;/a&gt; is a very real one. Bloodstream infections continue to be the most common, but infections in soft tissue or bone, and in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, are increasing. The more bases there are to cover, the harder &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; will be to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg" alt="Hospital cleaning" class="wp-image-156397 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean-600x339.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The CDC has issued guidelines for limiting &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; spread. (CDC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern that's emerging in the US is being repeated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-across-the-world-and-we-don-t-know-how-to-stop-it"&gt;across the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and health experts have been struggling to contain &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; since it was first discovered in Japan in 2009. The first US cases were reported in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-fungus-could-be-linked-to-climate-change-study-suggests"&gt;warnings have been issued&lt;/a&gt; about the threat posed by &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; – including a study released &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-deadly-superfungus-can-now-be-found-in-half-of-us-states"&gt;almost exactly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that infections had reached half of the states in the US – but as this Miami study shows, the surge is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;has a lengthy list of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for stopping the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infections, including diligent cleaning routines for surfaces and devices, and the use of single-patient rooms where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measures to prevent the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rely on isolation and contact precautions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

Quick-fix diets and extreme workouts often lead to temporary results, but small daily habits create long-lasting changes. Here are seven practical habits that help in shedding weight effectively without compromising health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start your metabolism with a cold shower&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a cold shower in the morning stimulates brown fat activity, which helps in burning calories throughout the day. It also improves circulation, enhances energy levels, and reduces stress, all of which contribute to a better metabolism and effective weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat more fermented foods for gut health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut plays a crucial role in weight management. Fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut help in improving digestion and reducing bloating. A balanced gut microbiome ensures better nutrient absorption and aids in reducing cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Intermittent fasting (such as the 16:8 method) helps in reducing insulin levels and promoting fat loss while maintaining muscle mass. Eating within a set window enhances metabolic flexibility and prevents overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chew food slowly to prevent overeating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating too fast leads to consuming more calories than needed.

This habit prevents overeating and enhances satisfaction with smaller portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swap one meal for a hearty soup or smoothie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing one heavy meal with a nutrient-packed soup or smoothie provides essential vitamins while keeping calorie intake in check.

As a result, you might use food as a way to unconsciously cope with boredom and emotional distress — or get sucked into a task to the point where you forget to eat for hours, thanks to feeling disconnected from your body’s hunger and fullness cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

&lt;p&gt;With everything there is to juggle in life, it’s easy to assume that everyone experiences that sinking-in-quicksand feeling as they navigate another busy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you find this feeling is paired with extreme levels of disorganization, inattention and overwhelm, these might be signs of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://chadd.org/for-adults/overview/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;10 million American adults&lt;/a&gt; (and over &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916320/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;365 million globally&lt;/a&gt;) are thought to have ADHD — and because symptoms can show up differently in adults, realizing you might have the disorder is typically a slow burn, the overlooked signs of which can cause significant strain on your life and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adults looking for diagnosis often have many subtle signs rather than completely failing,” &lt;a href="https://brainandmind.org" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dede O’Shea&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist at &lt;a href="https://physicians.lahey.org/details/4345/dede-oshea-psychiatry__behavioral_medicine-burlington" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Beth Israel Lahey Health&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hallmark symptoms of ADHD — inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity — typically aren’t as noticeable in adulthood, likely because adults whose ADHD wasn’t diagnosed in childhood have had a lifetime to parse together the skills necessary to compensate for their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some symptoms of ADHD also mimic those of anxiety or depression,” &lt;a href="https://www.peacehumanistic.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Cristina Louk&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Washington state, told HuffPost. “Most people will first get diagnosed with these disorders and get frustrated when treatment fails to alleviate their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the moment, you might find yourself attributing certain feelings and behaviors to other things — blaming feelings of hype on too much coffee or snapping at your frozen computer on sleep deprivation — when really, they’re symptoms of adult ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the sneakier signs you might be overlooking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

The technology, known as N-Tidal Diagnose, uses carbon dioxide sensors and AI to analyse a patient's normal breathing patterns, delivering results in just minutes. The rollout is expected to extend to the rest of the UK soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, COPD diagnosis relies on spirometry, a time-consuming procedure requiring patients to forcefully exhale into a device. Appointments can take between 30 and 90 minutes. N-Tidal Diagnose simplifies this process significantly, measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in normal breaths and providing a diagnosis within five minutes. This efficiency has led medical professionals to hail the device as "game-changing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPD encompasses a group of lung conditions, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, that cause breathing difficulties. The N-Tidal Diagnose device has received regulatory clearance and CE-marking under EU Medical Device Regulations for COPD diagnosis. Its developer, TidalSense, is also exploring its potential for asthma diagnosis. This innovative technology promises to transform COPD diagnosis, offering a quicker, more convenient, and potentially more accurate method for detecting this prevalent lung condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ameera Patel, chief executive of TidalSense, said: “For decades, respiratory diagnostics have lagged behind other areas of medicine, despite lung disease being one of the UK’s greatest healthcare challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The N-Tidal Diagnose device represents the first real breakthrough in COPD diagnosis in several decades, addressing both the needs of the patient and of the health system – and it’s designed to be deployed at scale across the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make respiratory diagnosis fast, accurate, and accessible to everyone who needs it, at the instant that they present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 bqSiOl"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, showing the N-Tidal Diagnose test to a patient" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-230636"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, showing the N-Tidal Diagnose test to a patient&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (TidalSense/PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated about 1.2 million people in the UK have COPD, with as many as two million people undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Patel claims the test could help the Government meet its goal of slashing NHS waiting times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “The NHS is under immense pressure and the Government has laid out ambitious plans to change the way services are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its targets against reducing waiting times and using staff time more efficiently will be easier to meet with the introduction of new tools like N-Tidal Diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This simple device can help significantly reduce waiting lists, improve patient experience, deliver accurate diagnoses and ultimately provide a better standard of care for the millions of people in the UK who have COPD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N-Tidal is also being tested for asthma, with the hopes it will one day be used to diagnose the condition once research trials are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, hailed the test as a “game changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COPD is one of the most underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed conditions we see in the NHS, and because spirometry testing can only be carried out by specially trained practitioners, it can lead to sizeable wait lists for diagnosis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having the ability to assess a patient’s lung health quickly and accurately with a device that gives near-instant results will be game-changing for respiratory care across both primary and secondary healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 23:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOOFFOUjVHNXN6cFpORmJJWHk5bV85UzVVM2hHYUpnX01PaUtxRThXV2NIV29oOVRYeDBNUDdyaTFzV3NRNUIteTZ1NUoyRnlIazVMWWpBcGtKZVhnVHJ2bjVtejBZVFMzODAtU2JRR0dqalpoR1B5UXpZNV9hM3FUQ19DTllHWHc</guid></item><item><title>Researchers Discover New Mechanism for Rapid Liver Regeneration to Restore Damaged Livers - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOTFhXZkJrd1hheG9IVDVZQ0J0d2VsUVQ0WWpuRldyUzViWTlmZXBacDhHUE0teExVS0ZHU0FhU1BKc2NTcU05dy11YnpIMkluVXhXNHFrMzRDX2NrbTFnY1FYRGNzZi1zZGxsbDBZX19ocGZVeS1UX01MQXpPV3hSM3dGOGhrWWZUZy1PeE9rWVhVYUk5dEY5YjUyNXBzWS1mNjZ0RDZCT2MwblpqWF9uMkhOZ1ZDeE00YVRocWtzVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Cancer Research Centre in Spain (CNIO) have discovered a mechanism that is triggered just minutes after acute liver damage occurs—and it could lead to treatments for those with severe liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The avenues for future treatments of liver damage include a diet enriched with the amino acid glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Glutamate supplementation can promote liver regeneration and benefit patients in recovery following hepatectomy or awaiting a transplant,” wrote the authors&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08778-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; in a paper published&lt;/a&gt; in ‘Nature’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver is a vital organ, crucial to digestion, metabolism, and the elimination of toxins. It has a unique ability to regenerate, which allows it to replace liver cells damaged by the very toxins that these cells eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the liver stops regenerating in cases of diseases that involve chronic liver damage–such as cirrhosis—and such diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent, associated with poor dietary habits or alcohol consumption. So activating liver regeneration is key to treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning to activate liver regeneration is therefore a priority today, to benefit patients with liver damage and also those who’ve had part of their liver cut out to remove a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has discovered in animal models this previously unknown mechanism of liver regeneration. It is a process that is triggered very quickly, just a few minutes after acute liver damage occurs, with the amino acid glutamate playing a key role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results describe a fundamental and universal mechanism that allows the liver to regenerate after acute damage,” explained Nabil Djouder, head of the CNIO Growth Factors, Nutrients and Cancer Group and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Edible Carbon Beads Can Reduce Cirrhosis Liver Disease By Restoring Gut Microbiome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/edible-carbon-beads-can-reduce-cirrhosis-liver-disease-by-restoring-gut-microbiome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Edible Carbon Beads Can Reduce Cirrhosis Liver Disease By Restoring Gut Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A “complex and ingenious” perspective on liver regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver regeneration was known to occur through the proliferation of liver cells, known as hepatocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully understood. This current discovery is very novel, as it describes communication between two different organs, the liver and bone marrow, involving the immune system, &lt;a href="https://www.cnio.es/en/news/cnio-researchers-discover-a-new-mechanism-for-rapid-liver-regeneration-triggered-by-glutamate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a CINO news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that liver and bone marrow are interconnected by glutamate. After acute liver damage, liver cells, called hepatocytes, produce glutamate and send it into the bloodstream; through the blood, glutamate reaches the bone marrow, inside the bones, where it activates monocytes, a type of immune system cell. Monocytes then travel to the liver and along the way become macrophages – also immune cells. The presence of glutamate reprograms the metabolism of macrophages, and these consequently begin to secrete a growth factor that leads to an increase in hepatocyte production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a rapid chain of events allows glutamate to trigger liver regeneration in just minutes, through changes in the macrophage metabolism. It is, says Djouder, “a new, complex and ingenious perspective on how the liver stimulates its own regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also clarifies a previously unanswered question: how the various areas of the liver are coordinated during regeneration. In the liver, there are different types of hepatocytes, organized in different areas; the hepatocytes in each area perform specific metabolic functions. The study reveals that hepatocytes producing a protein known as glutamine synthetase, which regulates glutamate levels, play a key role in regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE PROGRESS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Tumor-Destroying Sound Waves Treatment Coming to a Hospital Near You For Liver Cancer" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tumor-destroying-sound-waves-treatment-coming-to-a-hospital-near-you-for-liver-cancer/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Tumor-Destroying Sound Waves Treatment Coming to a Hospital Near You For Liver Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CNIO group, when glutamine synthetase is inhibited, there is more glutamate in circulation, which accelerates liver regeneration. This is what happens when the liver suffers acute damage: glutamine synthase activity decreases, blood glutamate increases, and from there, the connection with the bone marrow is established, reprogramming macrophages and stimulating hepatocyte proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible therapeutic applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments have been carried out in mice, but the results have been tested with bioinformatics tools, using databases of mouse and human hepatocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Djouder, “&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4l4mjlP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dietary glutamate supplementation&lt;/a&gt; may simply be recommended in the future after liver extirpation, and also to reduce liver damage caused by cirrhosis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAFFEINE ALERT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Coffee is Now Linked to Reduced Risk of Many Ailments, Including Liver Disease, Parkinson’s, Melanoma, Even Suicide" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/all-of-coffees-beneficial-effects-liver-disease-cancers-obesity/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Coffee is Now Linked to Reduced Risk of Many Ailments, Including Liver Disease, Parkinson’s, Melanoma, Even Suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first author of the paper, CNIO researcher María del Mar Rigual also wants future research to explore using glutamate supplements in humans who have undergone liver resection for tumor removal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — While many view March as Women's History Month, it is also Endometriosis Awareness Month, an often-debilitating condition estimated to affect over 6 million women in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, causing pain, inflammation and potential infertility. The road to a diagnosis has been challenging for many women, but one Ohio doctor has developed a noninvasive procedure that could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Sarah Fisher knew the health problems she would face, since her mother suffered from endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My sister and I were twins. When we started having our period and menstruating, our mom recognized the symptoms very quickly,” said Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 6.5 million women nationwide struggle with endometriosis. Historically, the only way to get diagnosed has been through an invasive procedure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Cincinnati Dr. Katie Burns made it her life's work to find a better way. She has recently developed a noninvasive test that can soon be done in the comfort of your home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What it is, is a collection of your menstrual fluid like a Diva cup or a menstrual cup or a menstrual disc, something along those lines, where you actually are able to collect the fluid,” said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10TV's Bryn Caswell asked Burns why it is important that a noninvasive procedure like this is developed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Surgery is the only definitive diagnosis," Burns said. “Now, if women have endometriosis that is on their ovary and they have an endometrioma, which is relatively large, that can be picked up by ultrasound or CT, MRI type of scans. But in general, most often, endometriosis is not picked up superficially.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns herself had trouble getting diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to many doctors after doctors, and it took me 10 years to get a diagnosis because I was told it was in my head, I was making it up,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go beyond test results, Fisher and her sister opened Restore Center for Pelvic Health and Wellness, a pelvic rehabilitation center in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's built for women who have endometriosis or whatever chronic pain condition you have," Fisher said. "No matter what that looks like, we're your people."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Burns and Fisher want women to know that they do not have to suffer in silence anymore.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm proud to know people like Katie are working on ways that make it so that my daughter will not have to go through an invasive procedure and probably seven to 10 years of getting the runaround with doctors to get diagnosed," Fisher said. "That she can in the privacy of her own home, collect a specimen to take to her doctor to get diagnosed. That's a huge step. As a mom with a daughter, that's a huge step.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
