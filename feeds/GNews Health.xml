&lt;p&gt;Taters and toast could be tooth trouble in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/13/2/461" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the number of AMY1 gene copies you have plays a crucial role in how the bacteria in your mouth respond to starch, potentially increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease for some people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most people have been warned that if you eat a bunch of sugar, make sure you brush your teeth,” &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/02/do-starchy-carbs-cause-cavities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Angela Poole&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and assistant professor of molecular nutrition at Cornell University. “The takeaway finding here is that depending on your AMY1 copy number, you may want to be just as vigilant about brushing your teeth after eating those digestible starches.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The findings could pave the way to more personalized dental care.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;RomanR – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Poor oral health can wreck havoc throughout the body.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kay Abrahams/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMY1 gene is responsible for producing salivary amylase, an enzyme that helps digest starch in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have linked AMY1 to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/21/new-treatment-for-cavities-is-easier-more-effective-study/"&gt;cavities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/02/cutting-daily-calories-could-help-reduce-gum-disease-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, scientists haven’t fully understood how salivary amylase interacts with starch to disrupt the oral microbiome and increase the odds of dental disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we wanted to know in this experiment. What’s going on in the mouth if someone eats starch, and is the answer different if their copy number is high or it’s low?” Poole said. “What we found was that there are other bacteria involved in these processes and that the changes depended on AMY1.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected saliva samples from 31 adults, each with different AMY1 copy numbers. They then added starch to the cultured samples, or biofilms, and observed how the bacterial makeup shifted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In samples with high AMY1 numbers, the team found that starch significantly reduced the proportions of two bacteria — Atopobium and Veillonella — while Streptococcus levels increased. All three bacteria are associated with tooth decay or gum disease, according to Poole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some increased and some decreased, so it’s not so straightforward as saying, ‘The whole thing is good or bad,’” Poole said. “It’s an interaction, but it looks like the AMY1 copy number, as well as which species are present in people’s mouths when they eat starch, is affecting the risk for developing these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Your body breaks down starchy foods into glucose, which fuels all tissues and organs with the energy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;M.studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study findings don’t mean you should ditch starch from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most people, starchy foods are a important source of carbohydrates and play a vital role in a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/starchy-foods"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; when eaten in moderation. They provide energy and fiber, along with essential vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-starch-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Starch-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include bread, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, corn and even bananas. People with higher AMY1 copies &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/10/18/did-eating-starchy-foods-give-humans-an-evolutionary-advantage--.html#:~:text=People%20with%20more%20copies%20of,pasta%2C%20but%20not%20sugary%20foods." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have an easier time breaking down starchy foods&lt;/a&gt; — a genetic variation that researchers believe evolved in certain groups over time.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The populations that historically had greater access to starch tend to have more copies,” Poole said, “which makes sense from a practical standpoint, because it would have given you a survival advantage when food is scarce, to be able to break down those starches more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this may have its benefits, Poole said the study also points to potential downsides for your teeth and gums. “If someone has a high copy number, they break down starch efficiently, and bacteria that like those sugars are going to grow more in that person’s mouth,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research could open the door to more personalized dental care. By understanding your genetic makeup, dentists might one day offer recommendations tailored to your individual risks when it comes to starch metabolism and oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result? A happier mouth and a healthier you. After all, tooth decay and gum disease don’t just mess with your smile or make eating and talking a challenge — they can affect your entire well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor oral health has been &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-dental-health-affects-overall-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;linked to a range of serious conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and certain cancers. Experts believe the issue lies with bacteria from the mouth entering the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that spreads throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/how-dental-health-and-mental-health-are-connected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dental and mental health are closely connected as well&lt;/a&gt;. Struggling with issues like gum disease or tooth decay can trigger feelings of embarrassment, low self-esteem, and anxiety, often leading to social isolation and a decline in overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;DALLAS (AP) — The number of people with measles in Texas increased to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases — Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years — increased by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said cases span over nine counties in Texas, including almost 100 in Gaines County, and 20 patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S. death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The child was treated at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility said the patient didn’t live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized “the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy went on to say in the post that his agency will continue to fund Texas’ immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a “top priority” for him and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly higher because homeschooled children’s data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/west-texas-measles-outbreak-spreads-amid-vaccine-hesitancy-in-some-communities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; West Texas measles outbreak spreads amid vaccine hesitancy in some communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95 percent vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles, a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours, eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles currently, but the state health department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials confirmed the first reported case in Travis County since 2019. Dr. Desmar Walkes of the Austin-Travis County Health Authority said the case involved an unvaccinated infant who was exposed to the virus during a vacation overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen said the case was one of four linked to international travel so far this year, none of which were part of the West Texas outbreak. The others were two in Houston last month and one reported this week in Rockwall County, east of Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Travis County case, the child’s family members were vaccinated and were isolating at home and no exposures were expected, Walkes said. She could not give the exact age of the infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the news conference urged people to get vaccinated if they are not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill and vaccine denial definitely kills,” said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School officials in two Texas cities each reported reported one rubella case this week, but Van Deusen said no infections had been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

            Authorities investigating the deaths of at least 60 people in northwestern Congo suspect the water source in one of the areas may have been contaminated, the World Health Organization said Friday. But the agency said it’s too early for any definitive conclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00033b6mn4nzgezd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors are investigating more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-disease-equateur-outbreak-9bd3dc848d3c1ae6196f1d194f56f7bd" target="_blank"&gt;illnesses&lt;/a&gt; that emerged since late January in five villages in Congo’s Equateur province, where high rates of malaria have complicated efforts to diagnose the cases and where officials have said they’ve been unable so far to confirm the main cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00043b6m2mjy9njd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said during an online briefing Friday that for one of the villages there is “a very strong level of suspicion of a poisoning event related to the poisoning of a water source.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00053b6m0t6zpprq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ryan did not clarify whether he was referring to contamination by accident, negligence or deliberate action. He also did not identify the village where the poisoning was suspected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8xfn00013b6mvwflkbic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will not stop investigating until we are sure that the true cause or the absolute cause of what is occurring here is fully investigated,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00063b6muwpccet2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Illnesses were first detected in late January in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00073b6mjeutq9ek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve cases and eight deaths in total have been recorded in Boloko, with no new cases recorded since January, officials say, adding that nearly half of deaths there occurred within hours of the onset of symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00083b6mx12d1ac3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The village of Bomate in Basankusu health zone, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Boloko, has been hit the most: 98% of the cases and 86% of deaths have been recorded there, health officials say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00093b6m74lz1so1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO said on Thursday that hundreds of the patients have tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. In addition to common malaria symptoms such as fever and body aches, patients have also shown symptoms like chills, sweating, stiff neck, runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000a3b6m781nzzr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health crisis has caused fear among residents, some of whom have said they fled the villages to avoid falling sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000b3b6mctuj5oyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say access to the sick has been hindered by the remote locations of the affected villages and that several people died before medical teams were able to reach them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000e3b6m0dc4rpvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Clearly, at the centre of this, we have some kind of poisoning event,” Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000f3b6mhc0np41b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another likely suspect could be a “toxic-type event either from a biological perspective like meningitis or from a chemical exposure,” the WHO emergencies chief said, citing systematic investigations carried out so far by experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000g3b6mfuvxujdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials, though, haven’t been able to confirm the main cause of the illnesses, he said, adding that the high rates of malaria and other common illnesses in the villages are making it difficult to determine the cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have spotted unique subtypes of fat cells in the human body, and by unraveling their functions, they found that the cells may play a role in obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Jan. 24 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7269483237674841009&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-024-02048-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fanatomy%2Fscientists-describe-new-type-of-fat-in-human-bellies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-02048-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-024-02048-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fanatomy%2Fscientists-describe-new-type-of-fat-in-human-bellies" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could theoretically open up avenues for new therapies to mitigate downstream effects of obesity, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finding these [fat] subtypes is something very surprising," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cris.bgu.ac.il/en/persons/esti-yeger-lotem" target="_blank" data-url="https://cris.bgu.ac.il/en/persons/esti-yeger-lotem" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Esti Yeger-Lotem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,a professor of computational biology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, told Live Science.

For example, fat cells, also called adipocytes, and immune cells work in concert to communicate with the brain, muscles and liver.

However, one of the many aspects of obesity that have left scientists puzzled is that not all fat is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat — fat cells that reside in the abdomen close to the internal organs — is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to a greater risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of various health problems than fat under the skin, known as subcutaneous fat. For example, excess visceral fat comes with a heightened risk of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, insulin resistance and liver disease. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies also&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest visceral fat is more "proinflammatory" than subcutaneous fat, which could potentially contribute to the ill health linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand what might be happening inside fat tissues, Yeger-Lotem and her colleagues charted a "cell atlas" of adipocytes as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body"&gt;&lt;u&gt;part of the Human Cell Atlas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a global project that aims to map all the cells in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers built this map using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA seq), which measures which genes are active and to what degree by looking at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular cousin of DNA. RNA molecules act as blueprints for proteins, shuttling instructions from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the cell's nucleus out to its protein-construction sites. By measuring RNA in the nuclei of cells extracted from fat tissue, the team gathered clues as to what each cell does inside the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeger-Lotem and colleagues examined samples of subcutaneous and visceral fat collected from 15 people during elective abdominal surgeries. Most adipocytes were fairly "classical" — meaning storing excess energy was their main purpose. But a small proportion of the fat cells were "non-classical," as their RNA suggested they carried out functions not typically associated with fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these cells were "angiogenic adipocytes," which carried proteins usually used to promote blood vessel formation; "immune-related adipocytes," which make proteins related to immune cell functions; and "extracellular matrix adipocytes," which are related to scaffold proteins that help support cells' structures. These cell subtypes, found in both visceral and subcutaneous fat, were also confirmed under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "state-of-the-art application" of snRNA seq suggests these cells may play a role in "remodeling" fat tissues, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Niklas Mejhert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. Remodeling here refers to the way fat tissues change in response to weight fluctuations or metabolic changes. "Healthy" remodeling would help maintain metabolic balance, but if dysregulated, it could spur inflammation and other drivers of poor health in obesity, Mejhert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also spotted differences in the newly described cell types depending on which tissue they were taken from. Unconventional adipocytes from visceral fat seemed more likely to communicate with the immune system than those found in skin fat, Yeger-Lotem said. This link to immune cells suggests the cell subtypes might play a role in triggering visceral fat's proinflammatory nature, which could help explain why belly fat is worse for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also hinted that the fat-tissue donors with higher insulin resistance tended to have a higher concentration of these unconventional cells in visceral fat than did people with lower insulin resistance. However, Mejhert noted that the authors did not prove causation, so it's not clear whether the cells might drive the insulin resistance in any way. It's too early to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these fat subtypes can be linked to human disease, understanding how they work could "help us fight inflammatory processes," Yeger-Lotem said. That could potentially help doctors predict the risk of insulin resistance in people with obesity, assuming all the dots connect, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berry cautioned that the study used a relatively small sample size and that, at this stage, it only suggests rather than definitively demonstrates that the fat cells have these unusual functions. Still, "these insights highlight the importance of understanding fat depots' unique behaviors to develop targeted treatments for obesity and related diseases," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Participants who received psilocybin demonstrated substantial improvements in emotional empathy compared to the control group, which received a placebo. These improvements lasted for at least two weeks after treatment. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can be categorized into two types: cognitive empathy (understanding another person’s perspective) and emotional empathy (feeling what others feel). While empathy is essential for forming emotional connections, research suggests that excessive empathy—particularly emotional empathy—can contribute to emotional distress, especially in individuals who frequently absorb others’ negative emotions. As a result, heightened emotional empathy has been linked to an increased risk of depression and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that psilocybin can temporarily enhance empathy, particularly emotional empathy, by increasing feelings of connectedness and reducing ego-related barriers. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms (commonly referred to as “magic mushrooms”) and is known for its hallucinogenic effects. It interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, leading to altered perception, mood, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Johannes Jungwirth and his colleagues aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on the empathy levels of depressed individuals and compare these changes to those observed in a placebo group. They assessed empathy differences at two days, eight days, and thirteen days after treatment. Their hypothesis was that psilocybin would increase emotional empathy and that this effect would persist for up to two weeks post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 51 individuals experiencing an acute depressive episode, 19 of whom were men. The participants’ average age was between 36 and 37 years. Those taking psychiatric medication were required to undergo a washout period before the study began. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin (25 participants) or a placebo (an identical-looking, inactive medication; 26 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved seven in-person visits to the research lab over a four-week period. The first visit consisted of screening. Participants then attended two psychological preparation sessions—one four days before treatment and another one day before treatment. On the third visit, participants received either a single oral dose of psilocybin or a placebo. This was followed by three additional visits at two, eight, and fourteen days after treatment. During these follow-ups, participants attended psychological support sessions designed to help them process difficult emotions and develop a narrative about their experience. At these sessions, they also completed assessments of empathy (using the Multifaceted Empathy Test) and depression (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psilocybin treatment led to an improvement in emotional empathy compared to the control (placebo) group. This improvement was evident as early as two days after treatment, peaked at eight days, and was moderate in magnitude. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding cognitive empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the eight-day and fourteen-day follow-ups, individuals in the placebo group who experienced a stronger increase in emotional empathy also tended to show greater improvements in depressive symptoms. However, this association was not observed in the psilocybin group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide evidence for the lasting effects of psilocybin on empathy in depressed patients, with significant increases in explicit emotional empathy observed up to 14 days after treatment. Given that conventional antidepressants have been observed to reduce empathy, psilocybin could be a promising candidate for enhancing social cognition and strengthening therapeutic alliance,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study contributes to the scientific understanding of psilocybin’s effects on depressed individuals. However, it is important to note that the study groups were relatively small, meaning some weaker effects may have gone undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;Psilocybin increases emotional empathy in patients with major depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by J.

&lt;p&gt;A blind Canadian man could soon see again thanks to a surprising source: his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Earlier this week, Brent Chapman underwent one of Canada’s first-ever “tooth in eye” surgeries. While it might sound like something straight out of science fiction, this jaw-dropping procedure has been restoring sight in other parts of the world for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a rare operation that most people have not heard of, even if you are an eye surgeon,” &lt;a href="https://drgregmoloneyvancouver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist and surgeon at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital in Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure, called osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, has been used in other parts of the world for decades.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors performed Canada’s first tooth in eye surgeries this week.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cheeky science &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis&lt;/a&gt; (OOKP), uses a patient’s own tooth to craft a support structure for an artificial cornea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operation is broken down into two parts. First, Moloney and his team removed one of Chapman’s teeth, shaved it down into a rectangle, drilled a hole and popped a plastic optical lens inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tooth then got a temporary home in his cheek, where it will stay for about three months.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“(The tooth) doesn’t have any connective tissue that I can actually pass a suture through to connect it to the eyeball,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/victoria-woman-becomes-1st-canadian-to-receive-rare-tooth-in-eye-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney told CTV News&lt;/a&gt;. “So the point of implanting it for three months is for it to gain the layer of supporting tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During the same procedure, Moloney prepared the eye by removing the top layer of the eye’s surface and replacing it with a soft tissue graft from inside Chapman’s cheek. This graft needs a few months to heal so it can support the implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney said the initial procedure went smoothly, and Chapman will be monitored closely over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it’s time for the second surgery, Chapman’s tooth will be removed from his cheek and placed into his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney and his team will pull back the graft, remove the damaged iris and lens, and sew the tooth (with its new optical lens) into the eye. The graft will then be resewn over the eye, leaving a small hole for the lens to peek through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end result is a pink eye with a small black circle through which Chapman will hopefully be able to finally see again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eyes on the prize &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A tooth might seem like an unlikely candidate for eye surgery, but it’s actually the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“(Teeth) contains dentin, which is the ideal tissue to house a plastic lens without the body rejecting it,” &lt;a href="https://thedailyscan.providencehealthcare.org/2025/02/canadas-first-tooth-in-eye-surgeries-aim-to-restore-bc-patients-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney explained to The Daily Scan&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the tissue from the cheek recognizes the tooth, making the whole process smoother. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surgeons typically use a canine tooth for the surgery.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get too excited just yet — this procedure isn’t risk-free. “With any ocular surgery of any kind, there’s a chance that we could introduce infection and lose all our vision,” Moloney told CBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also not meant for everyone. The surgery is often a last-ditch option for people with corneal blindness in the front of the eyes caused by conjunctival scarring from autoimmune diseases, chemical burns and other traumas, but who still have healthy retina and optic nerves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks, the procedure has been restoring sight for several decades in at least 10 countries with a high success rate. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study out of Italy&lt;/a&gt; found that, 27 years post-surgery, 94% of patients still had vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney himself has done seven successful tooth in eye surgeries in Australia before bringing his talents to Canada. “The risk-reward ratio for these patients, when they have no vision at all, is well worth it, we think,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney has successfully performed the operation seven times.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A life-changing gamble &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman has undergone 50 surgeries over the past 20 years, all aimed at restoring his sight, and he hopes this is his last one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old massage therapist from North Vancouver is blind in both eyes due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare autoimmune reaction triggered by a dose of ibuprofen he took after a basketball game when he was just 13.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Though some of the surgeries he had gave him temporary partial sight, it always faded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I get it back, you know, it would be sort of this great rush,” he told CBC. “Then I’d lose it again and it would be heartbreaking, and I sort of sank into this depression.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, Chapman hopes things will be different. When his doctor first pitched the tooth in eye surgery, he was hesitant. But after speaking with an Australian woman who had undergone the same procedure to tremendous success, he was sold. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She had been completely blind for 20 years, and is now snow skiing,” he said. Today, Chapman is dreaming about shooting hoops again and traveling the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman is one of six patients in a pilot program at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital. If the surgeries go well, Moloney and his team plan to pitch Health Canada for funding to open the country’s first OOKP clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re successful in getting this up and running and stabilized in Vancouver, then we will be the only active North American center for the operation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

I tried to stave off the inevitable by submerging myself in ice baths and drinking a brand of coffee that claimed to improve cognition. I paid too much for eye creams (to erase dark circles) and hair volumizers (to make my mane look fuller). I whitewashed my résumé, eliminating the year I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MK5ET53IZDBDNEASI5YMLRIHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I thought I needed to hide my age because of the ageism surrounding me: advertisements that depicted people my age as decrepit and frail, birthday cards that mocked us as deaf or daffy, and other media that simply erased us. For sure, I was not going gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U65RTG35TFFN7AOVJ45D4OWQWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took me several more years to understand that there are different ways to understand ageism, including what researchers call “internalized ageism,” or discriminating against ourselves — and our contemporaries — as we age. Or as Todd D. Nelson, a professor of psychology at California State University at Stanislaus, who edited the book “Ageism,” put it: “&lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x?casa_token=Ki9-NmUKaHgAAAAA%3ARDOX-t29125hQrR2P5ZYcPhkHGPnOCIAbsXxjtoh_NqwhlEi8CdOdQQTSmZQMwle8QuyJ2r7GR53" target="_blank"&gt;prejudice against our feared future self&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C27WBUPA5NFBJE5QF2SDABB65E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sure, those of us 55-plus face negative stereotypes, bias and discrimination — in health care (exclusion from clinical trials because of age), on the job (being passed over for promotion) and by the media (all those “look younger” ads). But I finally realized that the antiaging messages I was hearing weren’t just coming from others. The awareness set me on a path to reverse my own aging biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QKM6M65MZAJ3OAL4SCCKH7ZIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Negative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07317115.2024.2355539#d1e223" target="_blank"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; with getting older have their own &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757993/" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="525DQQCQBBFURN3CEAGJT6VEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjiIqQDNPQ" target="_blank"&gt;Becca Levy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading researcher on the psychology of aging, has written that internalized ageism may take as much as 7.5 years off your life — about the same as heavy smoking. Levy argues in her book, “Breaking the Age Code: How Your Beliefs About Aging Determine How Long and Well You Live,” that those under 60 who hold negative aging stereotypes (frailty, cognitive decline) are more likely to have a heart attack or develop other cardiovascular conditions after they turn 60 than those who make positive associations with getting older (wisdom, loyalty, reliability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IKKE4BZPNEI7DHTXUW4UM744Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The way we think about aging affects how we age,” Levy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTQWKBSEBFQ7P3PZIXPEVDUYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These negative associations get baked into our culture and our memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ3F3AH6QRGCTJPVXZIBUFTRA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be that way. Yes, we can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA"&gt;Embracing the positives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DARHBFTOIZGNROXI7JTIEOR2QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For my reset, I first turned to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/02/middle-age-midlife-transformation-retirementchrysalis/" target="_blank"&gt;Chip Conley&lt;/a&gt;, the author of “Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder.” Conley is also the founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.meawisdom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Elder Academy&lt;/a&gt; (MEA), a retreat center designed to help those in midlife navigate its challenges, whether they stem from retirement, empty nest syndrome, divorce or aging. I joined one of his retreats in 2022, on the cusp of turning 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VGHTSDVBHK5AXZBYH2DGPPHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the MEA, I spent a week with 19 other individuals, hearing admissions such as, “It’s too late for me to learn new things,” or “I’m past the age where I can reinvent myself.” Conley warned us of the dangers of a “closed mindset,” or becoming rigid, fearing change and even believing it’s just too late for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFHYOGITK5F7VNBBLNTCEH7RO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an exercise called the Great Midlife Edit, we wrote down our associations with getting older on bits of paper. (You already know mine, which were very similar to the others’.) We then tossed these scraps — representing our old mindsets — into a bonfire, watching them incinerate. “We’re letting go,” a new friend said excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4BAHWFEGBCHDBXN75WJSANZBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the second day, Conley asked us to describe what he called “a replacement mindset” — a list of the positives of aging. There are plenty, including greater experience and wisdom, less judgment of others and more acceptance of ourselves, even increased contentment or equilibrium. I understood what Conley was saying, but it was going to take time for me to fully grasp the import of his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ"&gt;Putting beliefs into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7I6XJO545FSJOG2GETW4FHUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the MEA, I began to think about intention and practice. Levy has outlined a three-stage process of bolstering positive age beliefs. The first is increasing awareness: “We know from our research that we often [hold] age beliefs without awareness and they can operate unconsciously.” She noted that children as young as 3 often internalize the age beliefs of the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWBCGCDF2REC7PTSDXZYQ75APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To combat this, Levy recommends journaling, “which involves writing down all the age beliefs you encounter over one week.” Was the portrayal positive or negative? Or were older people absent from a movie or a show, “because we know that lack of representation … can lead to them becoming marginalized as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OYFHY4IRD5GMXG4OOJAVE6KLFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her second exercise is to ask yourself: “Is what is said about older people ageist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SFWCTIMMFB2XD56FJJAAO5A6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ageism is considered one of the last acceptable forms of discrimination and can be challenging to call out. When you’re not sure if you’re seeing bias, Levy suggests changing the target to another marginalized group, such as women: “If an employee states the need to fire older workers, ask yourself how it would sound if the same comments were made about firing women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN3VORSGH5F45BKQ7HD7PFCFEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, she recommends an exercise to dismantle negative age beliefs “by countering them with accurate information.” Consider the belief that cognition inevitably declines as we get older. “In fact, a number of types of cognition have been found to improve later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697608/" target="_blank"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;, or thinking about thinking,” Levy told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCLFIPEUQRFYBONLROGVTNTRXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using her framework, I made a handful of pledges about how to reframe aging. Recently, I pointed out to a gift shop manager that the store sold only birthday cards that mocked older people. The manager, roughly my age, first took umbrage and then got my point, promising to order a different line. Similarly, when people tell me, “You look good for your age,” I nicely explain that that’s damning praise and ageist, because it implies most people my age look awful.

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be gearing up for potentially substantial changes in vaccine policies, specifically with respect to the federal government’s messaging and the composition of the advisory panel responsible for making recommendations on vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is planning to remove several members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices due to what he &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" aria-label="views as conflicts of interest"&gt;views as conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. ACIP’s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" aria-label="immunization schedules"&gt;immunization schedules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of HHS can hire or replace ACIP committee members, which may lead to new sets of CDC recommendations. ACIP’s first scheduled meeting since Trump was inaugurated &lt;a href="https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" aria-label="was postponed"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04"&gt;was postponed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week It’s not clear at this time exactly what this postponement signals, though in light of other changes within HHS it may be a foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CDC has been &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" aria-label="ordered"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; to shelve promotions it developed for multiple vaccines, including a “Wild to Mild” advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against influenza. Secretary of HHS Kennedy says he wants advertisements that incorporate a more robust version of “informed consent.” Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed. The Wild to Mild ads emphasizes the harm-reducing functions of vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, young children and the immunocompromised. Evidently, Kennedy wants messages that are more focused on potential adverse events associated with vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just this week the FDA canceled a meeting of its flu vaccine advisors. The panel was set to convene to discuss the composition of the 2025-2026 influenza vaccine.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" aria-label="has previously said"&gt;has previously said &lt;/a&gt;that he is concerned about the pharmaceutical industry’s close relationship with government agencies and the entities such as ACIP that advise them. But it’s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice. (We reached out to Kennedy’s office for comment, but did not receive a reply)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at HHS are taking place against the backdrop of a large &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" target="_self" aria-label="measles outbreak"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; which began in West Texas and thus far has claimed the life of a child and hospitalized 19 others. Practically all the people who’ve contracted measles are unvaccinated. Yet Kennedy seems to be &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" aria-label="downplaying"&gt;downplaying&lt;/a&gt; the situation in Texas and New Mexico, suggesting that such outbreaks are not unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" aria-label="told"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines “are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” he also maintained that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” Kennedy recently informed employees within his department that he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" aria-label="vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule"&gt;vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this doesn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy has invariably been outspoken on vaccines and what he sees as public health agencies’ “suppression” of controversial treatments. Just prior to the November election, Kennedy &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" aria-label="posted"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on X, warning the FDA that its “aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, [and] hydroxychloroquine” was about to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" target="_self" aria-label="embroiled in a culture war"&gt;embroiled in a culture war&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic that pitted unproven treatments against proven measures, such as vaccines. Kennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he rails against are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination—measles, mumps and rubella—shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" aria-label="sterilizing"&gt;sterilizing&lt;/a&gt;,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC’s messaging, hire and fire ACIP committee members and revise vaccine scheduling. The fact that the HHS secretary and probable CDC director, nominee Dave Weldon, have aligned views could facilitate the process of transforming vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" aria-label="bill"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which Weldon sponsored sought to undo what he saw as a conflict of interest entailed by CDC being both a promoter of vaccines and an evaluator of their safety. This echoes Kennedy’s opinion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Weldon be confirmed, he will be making the decisions regarding whether a vaccine should be recommended to the public.

The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; showed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcmJpTjdaUXp4UFNIeXNOdmZMZk04MFNZczNUQS01dmJyWVdkTVBpbndMWTZDZzc4ZWpIaXd3T3hodEx5LTVWV2RNZ0FFbXdjWVQwdmdBaFJmb21Kc0dRdDlvb2dCRUp5dTR1d3ZHbVNrUTFHc0s1ODl3NU5RTFNZUEotVS1LcE8wVFh1TVR2YTNPbjZaMUVmTQ</guid></item><item><title>Multilingualism Starts Early: Study Challenges View on Language Learning - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOT092eExyNVp5cDJncGNIZTNrZ24tWmZQLThnbG5wbnZvaHFCQVkxWFltRWpvbmJaVnZTWmpreXVjOEtmTDFWaDlib0R1c0ZLWG1vVzRhb3NMRDBJWFltZFhpanBxQ21TMHpaVjRReG9oOVprdl9Zbngyc0xXU1kzR1dCRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study of 121 infants in Accra, Ghana, reveals that babies regularly hear between two and six languages from multiple caregivers. Unlike the Western model of learning one language from a primary caregiver, these children acquire language through a dynamic social environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local languages like Akan, Ga, and Ewe are learned mainly through direct interactions, while English is acquired more indirectly via media and official communication. These findings highlight the need for a broader perspective on language acquisition that reflects global linguistic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Ghanaian infants hear two to six languages from multiple caregivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct vs. Indirect Input:&lt;/strong&gt; Local languages come from direct interactions, while English is learned mainly through media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redefining Language Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The study challenges Western assumptions about single-language learning models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study that examined 121 babies aged three to twelve months in Accra, the capital of Ghana, demonstrates a remarkable variety of language input in the early months of life. The children are regularly exposed to two to six languages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strikingly, the number of caregivers the children have also ranges between two and six, and babies who have more adults in their daily lives who regularly take care of them also hear more different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghana, families often live in so-called “compound buildings”, where many everyday interactions take place in the courtyard, where family, neighbors and other relatives play an important role in the lives of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that a child learns only one particular language from a single caregiver, as is often assumed in Western cultures, does not apply to these communities. Rather, children are surrounded by a rich spectrum of linguistic inputs from the very beginning,” says Paul O. Omane, the first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of studies on children’s language acquisition have been conducted in Western industrialized nations, which is why they often focus on a rather narrow conception of multilingualism. Our research shows that other societies show a much more vibrant multilingual environment,” the study’s lead researcher, Prof. Dr. Natalie Boll-Avetisyan adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding of the study is the distinction between direct and indirect language input. While English is primarily acquired through indirect channels such as television and official communication, children receive most of the local languages (such as Akan, Ga and Ewe) through direct contact with their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the proportion of direct input is higher in the local languages than in English, which is predominantly present as indirect input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often emphasized how important direct language contact is for language acquisition,” Natalie Boll-Avetisyan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, our results suggest that indirect input – especially through media and official communication – also plays an essential role in the children’s daily lives, particularly in urban contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of their empirical study, the researchers call for a broader view in language research. The common assumptions do not reflect the diversity and complexity found in other cultural contexts such as Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study makes it clear that it is not only the number of languages a child hears, but also the diversity of people and the different forms of input that have a decisive influence on language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that for many children, a multilingual environment is a dynamic, vibrant reality from the very beginning. Multilingualism is not just a bonus, but a fundamental part of children’s identity and social structure,” the researcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c6aba7b2b2aeafa7b5e8bcafababa3b4aba7a8a886b3a8afebb6a9b2b5a2a7abe8a2a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthias Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-potsdam.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthias Zimmermann – University of Potsdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2025.101558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalie Boll-Avetisyan et al. &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining the language input experiences of infants growing up in multilingual African environments is essential to understanding their language acquisition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We explored the language input to 3;0–12;0-month-old infants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 121) in Ghana (Sub-Saharan Africa), a non-Western and less-economically rich social context and highly multilingual country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data collection involved an interview assessment, followed by caregivers completing a 12-hour logbook to indicate the languages their child heard over a day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results demonstrated consistency of the infant’s language exposure across both input measurement tools, suggesting their reliability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results revealed that Ghanaian infants are raised multilingually, exposed to between two and six languages, and engage with between two and six regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was no evidence for associations of age with number of languages or regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analyses of the relative amount of input in Ghanaian English, Akan, Ewe, and Ga, revealed that infants receive less direct than indirect input in Ghanaian English, with no such difference observed in Akan, Ewe, Ga, and no evidence of age effects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings shed light on the language environment and input to African infants raised in multilingual societies, highlighting the impact of social and cultural contexts on linguistic input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude with reflections on studying infants in non-Western, less-economically Rich social contexts in multilingual Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:34:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOT092eExyNVp5cDJncGNIZTNrZ24tWmZQLThnbG5wbnZvaHFCQVkxWFltRWpvbmJaVnZTWmpreXVjOEtmTDFWaDlib0R1c0ZLWG1vVzRhb3NMRDBJWFltZFhpanBxQ21TMHpaVjRReG9oOVprdl9Zbngyc0xXU1kzR1dCRQ</guid></item><item><title>13 Foods to Boost and Strengthen Your Kidneys - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9lSTVDdGh3YnFORmJaZWY4UG1mYVV6WGVNRWJFZVBoSmh5RHdrTjBVOXFMMnJ0Qk5UR2FGR2Z4WDd5aGRrQUxyRTVzRU03dW83d0NHa0tHVUtSaGlWVVVfRTM1bXU4MmFCWWtRclA2a19XYVFCS2UyZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;According to the CDC, it is estimated that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-id="f698660b-7fea-41dc-b9d7-388be0bc7f03" href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidney-disease/about/index.html" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;over one in seven&lt;/a&gt; US adults has chronic kidney disease.

(Even though experts widely acknowledge that plant-based meat would, in fact, better help feed a growing population, as it &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00134/full#h16"&gt;requires less land and water&lt;/a&gt; and generates far &lt;a href="/22787178/beyond-impossible-plant-based-vegetarian-meat-climate-environmental-impact-sustainability"&gt;less greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; than animal meat.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But take a closer look at Elanco, and Simmons’s opposition isn’t all that surprising. The company he runs, which spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in 2019, is a world leader in developing and marketing pharmaceuticals — including antibiotics and vaccines — for both pets and livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates"&gt;nearly all&lt;/a&gt; meat, milk, and eggs come from factory farms, which are prone to being overcrowded, stressful, disease-ridden environments where animals are especially susceptible to infections. Products from companies like Elanco are integral to preventing and treating those inevitable infections, serving an essential role in industrial animal agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R32rarr6:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Pigs at a factory farm in North Carolina.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Callaghan O’Hare/Bloomberg&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwxa _1j8uwx9"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Turkeys at a factory farm in Michigan.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Rudy Malmquist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If plant-based meat were ever to displace some of the conventional meat supply, it would mean fewer factory-farmed animals, and thus less profit for Elanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Alternatives to animal-derived protein,” among other things, the company &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001739104/db9c37f7-e0c2-43f9-95a5-17edac7e6524.pdf"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a 2019 financial report, “could negatively affect the market for our products.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91193489/a-climate-solution-is-here-and-it-has-four-stomachs"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eat-burger-climate-guilt-unpacked-jeff-simmons/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, Simmons has also exaggerated the potential of technology to slash livestock emissions. In 2021, he claimed — without citing evidence — that some cattle operations could reach net zero emissions within a decade, and that we shouldn’t expend energy on changing people’s diets to fight climate change. That flies in the face of &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; from climate scientists and agriculture experts, who, in a 2021 survey, overwhelmingly agreed that rich- and middle-income countries need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, which currently account for about &lt;a href="/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf"&gt;15 to 20 percent of global emissions&lt;/a&gt;, and that slashing meat and dairy consumption is the most effective way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On conference stages, Simmons has criticized Bill Gates’s bullish support for meat alternatives and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/23/chipotle-ad-wins-tv-cannes"&gt;Chipotle marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt; critical of factory farming, while another Elanco executive criticized raising animal welfare standards for chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Elanco declined an interview request for this story and didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions. “For 70 years, Elanco has pioneered ways to improve animal health and wellbeing and raise livestock more sustainably,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox. “We work alongside farmers and veterinarians to bring forward leading innovations in nutrition and diet management, digestion optimization as well as on-farm sustainability solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The company’s work can be thought of as part of the “&lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/why-are-nonhuman-animals-victims-harm/content-section-3"&gt;animal-industrial complex&lt;/a&gt;” — a network of companies, governments, and public and private research centers that, according to sociologist &lt;a href="https://www.richardtwine.com/"&gt;Richard Twine&lt;/a&gt; at Edge Hill University in the UK, make up the factory farm system, promote its continued existence and expansion, and defend it from criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco Animal Health Inc., center, applauds while ringing the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“There’s a lot of effort being put into protecting business as usual,” Twine said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That animal-industrial complex encompasses meat, milk, and egg companies and their trade associations, pharmaceutical companies like Elanco, genetics companies that &lt;a href="/xpress/2014/10/2/6875031/chickens-breeding-farming-boilers-giant"&gt;breed farm animals to grow bigger and faster&lt;/a&gt;, and the seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment companies involved in growing animal feed. It also includes public institutions, such as industry-friendly agencies like the &lt;a href="/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing"&gt;US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming"&gt;land-grant universities&lt;/a&gt; that receive funding from and partner with the meat industry on its research priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The entities within this ecosystem work to boost meat production and sales, shape public policy, and amplify messaging that improves consumer perception of animal products.

The Animal Health Institute, a trade group that represents the animal pharmaceutical industry, didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions about the industry and pointed me to progress reports from the intergovernmental &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2024/10/towards-a-healthier-future-for-all-amr-progress-report-en.pdf"&gt;World Organization for Animal Health&lt;/a&gt; and the trade group &lt;a href="https://healthforanimals.org/healthforanimals.org/roadmap/"&gt;HealthforAnimals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last century, these companies’ innovations in developing infection-fighting antimicrobial drugs for livestock were critical to building the factory farm system as we know it today. That system helped make meat, milk, and eggs more affordable and abundant, and lower their per-pound carbon footprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it also has contributed to serious &lt;a href="/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement"&gt;animal welfare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; concerns, including &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda"&gt;antimicrobial-resistant germs&lt;/a&gt; or “superbugs,” which adapt and build resilience against the antibiotics laced in farmed animals’ feed and water. When these germs escape the farm and infect humans, antibiotics are ineffective at treating them, which can make common ailments difficult or even impossible to heal. Heavy antibiotic use in livestock, along with overuse of antibiotics in humans, is a significant driver of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;killed over one million people worldwide in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and played a role in an additional 4.95 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around 70 percent of antibiotics important in human medicine are fed to farmed animals, both in &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/david-wallinga-md/antibiotic-use-remains-far-too-intensive-us-livestock"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/despite-rising-deaths-bacterial-infection-meat-industry-under-little-pressure-2024-03-12/#:~:text=However%2C%20by%20far%20the%20biggest,animal%20feed%20to%20increase%20growth"&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;. The World Health Organization has called for &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;significant reductions&lt;/a&gt; and considers &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; “one of the top global public health and development threats.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That crisis can be partly pinned on the pharmaceutical companies that helped to build factory farming, undermining their &lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/en-us/about-us/our-vision"&gt;stated missions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.zoetis.com/our-company/our-story/about-us"&gt;improving human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/about-us/"&gt;animal health&lt;/a&gt;. After decades of increasing pressure from consumers, public health experts, and US policymakers, some of these pharma companies have in recent years pledged to move away from antibiotics, but little progress has been made. And through it all, animal pharma companies have remained set on further expanding factory farming in the US and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-big-pharma-helped-build-factory-farming" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How Big Pharma helped build factory farming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the interwar period, the discovery of antibiotics like Prontosil and penicillin led to a pharmaceutical revolution, enabling doctors to quickly heal common bacterial infections in humans that until then had often been life-threatening. The drugs soon became mass-produced and affordable, and more antibiotic discoveries followed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t long until pharmaceutical leaders like Pfizer looked for markets beyond human medicine. They found it on the farm, according to &lt;a href="https://people.ucd.ie/claas.kirchhelle"&gt;Claas Kirchhelle&lt;/a&gt;, a medical historian at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research who documents the rise of antibiotics in agriculture in his book &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvscxrvf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pyrrhic Progress: The History of Antibiotics in Anglo-American Food Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the late 1940s, researchers came to understand that when farmed animals are fed regular, low doses of certain antibiotics, they gain weight faster on less feed and better stave off disease, Kirchhelle explains in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This one-two punch of disease prevention and rapid weight gain suddenly made it more feasible to pack large numbers of animals in barns, while having fewer animals die from infectious diseases and shortening the amount of time it took for animals to reach their “market weight.” These became two hallmarks of factory farming, enabling farmers to squeeze more meat out of each animal and increase profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antibiotic adoption in the meat industry was swift: By 1951, around 16 percent of antibiotics sold in the US went to livestock; by 1970, it reached 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A veterinarian preparing a vaccine for a dairy cow.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Sutthichai Supapornpasupad&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;America’s precipitous increase in meat production after World War II, facilitated in part by antibiotics, was widely celebrated as a solution to Malthusian fears that humanity wouldn’t be able to feed a rapidly growing global population. “For patriotic US researchers, politicians, and journalists, promulgating agricultural plenty and efficiency-boosting technologies like antibiotics became a moral duty,” Kirchhelle writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the 1960s, scientists paid increasing attention to the antimicrobial resistance threat posed by animal agriculture. Strains of bacterial diseases like salmonella and E. coli can adapt and build resistance to those antibiotics and then leave the farm and infect humans in a number of ways: improperly cooked meat, livestock manure leaching into drinking water or rivers and streams, or on the clothes of a farm owner or worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees animal pharmaceuticals, for decades failed to take the issue seriously and downplayed warnings. In the 1970s, the agency did make an earnest attempt to limit the use of two classes of human-critical antibiotics in livestock, but it was thwarted by a burgeoning coalition of livestock and pharmaceutical business interests. According to Kirchhelle, this coalition also funded a separate organization to conduct “counter science” to muddy the scientific debate over the proposed ban, which included organizing experts to write a report that was then edited without the researchers’ consent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA took two basic but important actions to meaningfully address the problem: requiring farmers to get veterinarian prescriptions for medically important antibiotics, and asking — though not requiring — animal pharmaceutical companies to remove language on product labels about antibiotics’ ability to make animals grow faster. Sales of antibiotics soon fell rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It represented progress, but not enough, according to Gail Hansen, an antimicrobial expert and former state public health veterinarian in Kansas. Hansen told me the agency’s actions represented a compromise that was favorable to industry compared to what some high-ranking members of Congress were pushing for at the time: significant antibiotic use restrictions and increased transparency from drug makers on how their antibiotics were used in livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pharma companies wanted to change antibiotic use “on their own terms and not the government telling them what to do,” according to Hansen. “If they could show just a little bit of good faith,” by complying with the FDA, they could stave off stricter regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="pharma-and-big-ag-still-cant-quit-antibiotics" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Pharma and Big Ag still can’t quit antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last decade, livestock pharma companies have found themselves at a crossroads. Under growing scrutiny from public health experts and policymakers, the biggest players in the sector have committed to “&lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/en-us/sustainability/esg-reporting/antimicrobial-stewardship"&gt;antimicrobial stewardship&lt;/a&gt;,” promising to wean farmers off medically important antibiotics by investing in vaccine development, nutritional supplements like enzymes and probiotics, and animal-only antibiotics, which aren’t used in human medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But while the FDA’s actions cut antibiotic use on farms from 2015 to 2017, corporate efforts since then have seemingly failed to move the needle: Sales of medically important antibiotics increased 10 percent from 2017 to 2023, and the US remains far behind Europe, where in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/us-lagging-europe-efforts-cut-antibiotics-livestock"&gt;antibiotic use per animal was about half&lt;/a&gt; that of the US. The continent slashed antibiotic use through tougher regulations, better farm hygiene, and relying more on vaccines, enzymes, probiotics, and other products to prevent disease, according to Leon Marchal, a Netherlands-based innovation director at IFF Health &amp;amp; Bioscience, which develops and sells animal health products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite the animal pharmaceutical industry’s stated commitments to antimicrobial stewardship, some of their actions have suggested a reluctance to move away from the drugs. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/ru-ru/sustainability/esg-reporting/antimicrobial-stewardship"&gt;share of Elanco’s revenue&lt;/a&gt; from medically important antibiotics, for both pets and livestock, stood at 10 percent, down just 2 percent from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 2018, the company ran an advertising campaign designed to assuage consumer concerns over &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/animal-antibiotics-calm-down-about-your-chicken-says-big-pharma"&gt;antibiotics in meat production&lt;/a&gt;. And at a major pork industry conference the same year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/health/drug-companies-antibiotics-resistance.html"&gt;Elanco handed out brochures&lt;/a&gt; encouraging farmers to feed pigs a pair of antibiotics to make the animals grow fatter. But a few years earlier, the FDA had told one of Elanco’s subsidiaries that drug combination was unsafe and shouldn’t be promoted to increase weight gain. Elanco committed to stop distributing the brochures &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/health/drug-companies-antibiotics-resistance.html"&gt;after the New York Times inquired&lt;/a&gt; about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“For more than 15 years, we’ve been focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use, reducing the need for antibiotics and improving the health of animals through vaccines, nutrition and other efforts,” Elanco wrote in a statement to Vox. “Most importantly, Elanco has focused on expanding access to animal-only antibiotics, which don’t create a threat to human resistance, and creating antibiotic alternatives, including vaccines, enzymes, probiotic and prebiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around the same time, Zoetis was using similar messaging when &lt;a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-10-12/worlds-biggest-animal-drugs-company-sells-antibiotics-to-fatten-livestock-in-india-despite-superbug-risk"&gt;selling human-relevant antibiotics to farmers in India&lt;/a&gt;, where, like in other middle-income countries, poultry factory farming is quickly expanding. The company told the press that it was following India’s antibiotics regulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the reputational risk of selling medically important antibiotics in the US rises, some of the biggest animal pharmaceutical companies are moving on to what Elanco has called its “next economic opportunity”: mitigating climate change. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-approves-first-animal-drug-reduces-gas-emissions-animal-or-its-waste"&gt;gained FDA approval for a drug&lt;/a&gt; that reduces ammonia emissions in cattle; &lt;a href="https://www.zoetis.com/news-and-insights/featured-stories/zoetis-announces-research-collaboration-to-explore-potential-solutions-to-inhibit-methane-emissions-from-ruminant-livestock?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Zoetis has also announced research efforts&lt;/a&gt; to develop a similar product. Last year, the FDA completed its review of Elanco’s Bovaer product — a powder that when fed to dairy cows daily can reduce emissions from their methane-rich burps — and deemed it safe and effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re committed to bringing innovative solutions that allow farmers and ranchers to reduce and measure emissions,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These products have the potential to reduce some types of cattle-caused emissions, but by much less than we could by simply eating far fewer animal products and more of the plant-based foods that Elanco executives have attacked. But companies that depend on factory farming would prefer we keep engineering animals’ diets for maximum productivity, and now, minimal environmental liability, rather than reach for a veggie burger or glass of soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This new class of emission-reducing feed products may come with a sustainable sheen, but they’re in keeping with how the industry views animals — not as living, feeling creatures, but as machines whose diets and environments must be endlessly fine-tuned with chemical inputs to compensate for unhygienic farms, poor animal welfare, and a sizable carbon footprint. Even as policy leaders in wealthy countries begin to wake up to the costs of this system, it continues to grow bigger and more entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This “model of food production,” Kirchhelle said, “is becoming more and more the dominant mode of producing animals worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQcm9WTEszYU1wMS01YkxrLWEtaGpZajY0T0tXU3BoeDI1SDNVMUFCQlA1dUhOTVlYUU5QRTQ3RmVGQ0VYQnlBLXFWWUJKTmxrUDJiVFNNQWhGR2tpWmdYb05oeDdMYVFxT3dlMTl4Skw2dGdzLTc2Nk1xMW1BaG52SkFlTlVBejdxRV91YVFaSkt5NTZ6UTVIVXV3</guid></item><item><title>Daily Dose of Broccoli Sprout Extract Helps Blood Sugar, Study Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWUExSGIwdXBiSnZyM1h5NGdaalJGTmhOdTI3eFpYX2FqN19tOXNDRTkySzM0cUZWNnN1S1Y2d1hDcHNoYzRZSU5ZRlQzTTBHTWVUWEdpMTZJUEJHcjU4SjVNWlhLMldNMTdmTWM5VWdCWEJSb3REN2M3aTd5ejlsQTlTRVRpQWRkUlQteTBzdDlWZWhyb2pSZXhTRWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a key compound in foods like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage can reduce blood sugar levels, potentially providing an inexpensive, affordable way to prevent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; from developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 74 people aged between 35 and 75 with rising blood sugar levels that categorize them as prediabetic. All the participants were also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-predict-80-of-american-adults-will-be-overweight-or-obese-by-2050"&gt;overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers were given either a compound commonly found in cruciferous vegetables known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulforaphane"&gt;sulforaphane&lt;/a&gt; or a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="153259" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; every day for 12 weeks. Those given sulforaphane showed a significant reduction in blood sugar, report the researchers, led by a team from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DiabetesChart.jpg" alt="Diabetes response chart" class="wp-image-153262 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DiabetesChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DiabetesChart-600x319.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Responses to the treatment varied between individuals. (Dwibedi et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment of prediabetes is currently lacking in many respects, but these new findings open the way for possible precision treatment using sulforaphane extracted from broccoli as a functional food," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/reduced-prediabetes-in-people-who-ate-broccoli-compound"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anders Rosengren, a molecular physiologist at the University of Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some individuals within the test group, the reduction in blood sugar levels was even more considerable: those with early signs of mild age-related  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153259" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively low BMI, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crucial-role-for-insulin-found-in-immune-system-t-cells"&gt;low insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, a low incidence of fatty liver disease, and low insulin secretion saw a drop that was double the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;Gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; also seems to make a difference. The team identified the bacterial gene BT2160 – known to be involved in sulforaphane activation – as significant, those with more of this gene in their gut bacteria showed an average blood sugar drop of 0.7 millimoles per liter, compared to 0.2 mmol/L for sulforaphane vs placebo overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These variations demonstrate the need for personalized approaches to prediabetes. The more we know about which groups of people get the best response from which treatments, the more effective those treatments will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results of the study also offer a general model of how pathophysiology and gut flora interact with and influence treatment responses – a model that could have broader implications," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/reduced-prediabetes-in-people-who-ate-broccoli-compound"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rosengren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/7/1388/148937/Global-Prevalence-of-Prediabetes"&gt;estimated to affect&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of millions of people globally, and incidence rates are rising fast. As many as 70 to 80 percent of people with prediabetes will then &lt;a href="https://drc.bmj.com/content/8/2/e001529"&gt;go on to develop diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, though the figure varies considerably depending on gender and the definitions used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's clearly an urgent need to prevent the transition from one condition to the next – and all the health implications – but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-25-year-study-has-identified-six-different-types-of-prediabetes"&gt;prediabetes often goes undiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; or untreated. These new findings could certainly help, but the researchers also emphasize the importance of a holistic approach in reducing diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around," said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US declared measles "eliminated" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak "not unusual", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions," Leah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;In Lubbock, worried parents and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kyle Rable Kyle Rable and his wife expecting a baby boy" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Kyle Rable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Kyle Rable and his wife are extremely concerned for their son's first year of life, when he cannot be vaccinated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community," said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I share that concern with them," said Dr Malbari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy stays mum on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine skeptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to "do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult" to get vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is "what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In addition to calling the Texas outbreak "not unusual", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a devastating disease," he said. "And it's completely preventable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Vaccines as a 'choice'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more," he said.

Experts “think it’s something lifestyle and environmental, but exactly what that is, we don’t know,” Cecchini said. Researchers are investigating what could be happening. In the meantime, it’s important that you stay alert about colorectal cancer ― even if you’re young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of this is knowing the warning signs.

She thought that she had irritable bowel syndrome, so she didn’t go to the doctor at first. When she finally did, she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what experts say about this particular issue:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrow stool can be a red flag.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors will sometimes see patients whose “stools are much thinner, or they’re pencil in thickness and size, which is a description that some patients with colorectal cancer will have,” Cecchini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tends to occur if tumors are present near the end of the colon or if they line the entire inside of the colon, which narrows whatever stool passes through, Cecchini explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy stool should be long and sausage-shaped, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320938" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to Medical News Today" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09181e4b08e33534cd1f8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320938" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, and come out as one piece or several smaller pieces. What’s most concerning is when thin stools are a new change that’s persistent, said &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jeffrey+M.+Dueker/1326192" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jeffrey Dueker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09181e4b08e33534cd1f8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jeffrey+M.+Dueker/1326192" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Dueker&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dueker, any noticeable alteration in your bowel habits could be a potential red flag (but, he stressed, is not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a sign of colon cancer). In addition to a change in stool shape or consistency, this can include going to the bathroom more or less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pencil-thin poop is one of the less common signs of colorectal cancer. “When it exists, it is highly concerning,” Cecchini said. “It’s just not one of the more common symptoms of the disease.” The more widespread signs are blood in the stool and abdominal pain. Unintentional weight loss is another sign. And some cases of colorectal cancer have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: MoMo Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;MoMo Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Flag any concerning symptoms to your physician.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you notice any symptoms, you should tell your doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should never discount your symptoms, Cecchini said, if you notice blood in your stool, chronic abdominal pain, a change in bowel movements, or unexplained weight loss, it’s important that you tell your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very easy in younger individuals to think, ‘Oh, it’s just hemorrhoids,’ or something like that ... and it may be, but also those things can coexist,” said Cecchini. “People certainly have hemorrhoids and cancer, or it can be something else completely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, getting a colonoscopy or another colorectal cancer screening is the best way to lower your risk or catch it in the early stages.

in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In it he warned the world's next pandemic would likely come from a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-8c9aed70-e94a-11ef-884c-97b0c0596a6e"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; spilled over from a wild animal in a wet market - possibly in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-8c9f8150-e94a-11ef-884c-97b0c0596a6e"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. He was spot on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Quammen is becoming increasingly nervous about the 'next big one'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, he claims it's just a matter of time before another new threat emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His remarks come just as a &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14421599/coronavirus-potential-cause-pandemic-discovered-china.html"&gt;new coronavirus feared to be powerful enough&lt;/a&gt; to spread through humans was discovered in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scenes eerily reminiscent of the beginnings of Covid, researchers at the infamous &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wuhan/index.html" id="mol-2f765ae0-f54c-11ef-8b30-f78bf6c6303a"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; Institute of Virology detected the new coronavirus strain living in bats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is strikingly similar to the pandemic virus, sparking fears that history could repeat itself just two years after the worst was declared over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In New York, employees clean cages and take chickens to be slaughtered after an outbreak of bird flu in February&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While concerning, Mr Quammen is much more worried about a different virus, however: bird flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, he claims, poses the biggest risk of becoming the next pandemic - and the threat could arrive at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: 'I have high concerns about &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-94067e80-e94a-11ef-884c-97b0c0596a6e"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;. If you're going to make a prediction about what would be the next big one now, a scientist would probably say, well, bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-94067e81-e94a-11ef-884c-97b0c0596a6e" class="class"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; has the best chance of being our next pandemic virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But there's always a lot of randomness built into this because these viruses have high mutation rates and mutation is basically a random process.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he added if these random mutations cause H5N1 bird flu to not only infect humans but also easily transmit from person to person, then the variation would be 'an extremely dangerous' virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Quammen told the Daily Mail he was concerned about several viruses, including H5N1, malaria and Ebola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen continued: 'Just the way the Covid virus went from being a rare virus to being a virus in humans and in wildlife all over the planet, that could happen starting tomorrow with bird flu.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The H5N1 strain of bird flu was first detected in the US in 2022. It has infected 70 people and killed one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 166million birds have been confirmed to have some strain of the virus and in the last 30 days, the USDA reported 139 flocks have been infected, affecting more than 18.5million birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus has also been detected in 973 dairy herds, and confirmed among cats, raccoons, skunks, wild dogs, bears, dolphins and cattle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human cases can be traced back to contact with infected animals and there is currently no evidence of person-to-person transmission.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the variability and unpredictable nature of viruses, Mr Quammen said there is a possibility a global pandemic will never happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But he stressed betting on this outcome is like gambling on a roulette wheel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'It might take four or five mutations of just the right combination to do that, and each of those mutations is a highly improbable event. And the combination of the right four or five is therefore an even more improbable event.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the same as roulette, he explained. The odds of a roulette ball landing on the number and color you bet on are extremely low, and the odds of two roulette balls landing on two numbers and colors you choose are even lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he warned, if you spin the wheel millions and millions of times, the odds of the balls landing in the right spots go up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And if you spin the wheel a billion times, eventually it will happen,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Officials from the Department for Environment Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA) dispose of culled ducks at a farm in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a summary of the bird flu outbreak in the US in the previous 30 days ending February 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen continued: 'Now, what's happening with bird flu right now is we are spinning the wheel billions and billions of times because this virus is replicating itself by the billions in each individual bird that it infects - probably every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My sense is this virus is replicating itself around the world continually right now, in millions of wild birds, in probably millions of chickens and in quite a few cows and other mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All of those replications, each individual viral replication in each animal, is a spin of the roulette wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not saying it's a certainty that bird flu will be our next pandemic; I'm just saying that it's a very very distinct possibility.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Mr Quammen's 2012 book, he and experts predicted the next pandemic would come from a novel coronavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has insisted the risk of bird flu to people remains low.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while Mr Quammen said H5N1 is most likely to spark the next outbreak, he named several other viruses public health officials should actively monitor, including the family of coronaviruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a new strain of coronavirus appeared, it would be a 'very dangerous signal,' he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14421599/coronavirus-potential-cause-pandemic-discovered-china.html"&gt;a new strain appears to have emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the form of HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was discovered in bats in China and tests showed it infiltrated human cells in the same way as SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharing their discovery in the journal Cell, the Beijing-funded researchers admitted it posed a 'high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Ebola in Uganda is another virus to be concerned about, with the country recently announcing its &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14342859/ebola-outbreak-sparks-alarm-man-dies-horror-unexplained-bleeding.html"&gt;eighth Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after a nurse died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen said: 'Both of those are very serious events. Ebola is a very horrible disease. It has a high kill rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's very, very unlikely to be the next global pandemic... [but] Ebola is dangerous. If you're a poor person living in an African village and somebody in the village has it, it's very dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it's not nearly as dangerous to the world.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the World Health Organization reported there have been at least 1,096 illnesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 60 fatalities from &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14443747/doctors-sound-alarm-mystery-crying-disease-deaths-rise.html"&gt;an outbreak of an unknown disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above are cows that died after being infected with bird flu in California in 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the patients are dying within 48 hours of symptoms appearing and known viruses like Ebola and Marburg have been ruled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen is also concerned about mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, which he called 'neglected tropical diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen said: '[Dengue] has a huge impact in terms of sickness and mortality, but people don't pay much attention to it because it's carried by mosquitoes in tropical countries and we don't have to worry about it up in the cool north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At least we presently don't. With climate change it may come to us.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other mosquito-borne diseases he named, but was less concerned about, were yellow fever, Zika and West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aside from any current or possible viruses, Mr Quammen is also 'absolutely' worried about food safety and public health implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only are there 34billion chickens in the world at risk of being infected with bird flu, along with consumers eating their meat or eggs, but there is also a risk of farm workers handling infected birds, contracting the virus and then passing it to other humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the massive industrial agriculture and unsanitary conditions of meat farms and factories 'are petri dishes for the evolution of viruses'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quammen added: 'These mass industrial scale animal husbandry operations are dangerous for everybody, and not just the people who buy their poultry or their pork from those operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not just the fact that we have 8billion humans on this planet. It's the fact that we have 8billion humans and a large portion of those humans live in circumstances that allow them to buy a lot of animal protein.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No matter where the next pandemic may come from, Mr Quammen said humans play a major role in either preventing or causing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Climate change, excess consumption, over population, over crowding and unsanitary living conditions all contribute to viral outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a map of locations where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in the US between May 2022 and February 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen said: 'It's not just sheer numbers of the human population that's causing the problem. It's population size multiplied by consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And that's causing two things. It's causing disruption of wild ecosystems where a lot of these viruses live in wild animals minding their own business, and as we disrupt those ecosystems we give those viruses the opportunity to get into us to spill into humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And that's an opportunity that is like winning the sweepstakes for the [viruses] because it gives them an extremely successful global virus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Mr Quammen said the 'factory scale' production of animals for consumption is a major risk factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are also producing animal protein in domestic animals on a factory scale, with high concentrations of animals, hundreds of thousands of pigs, millions of chickens, crowded together on one farm or in one building,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid a pandemic, Mr Quammen stressed stricter climate change protocols and focusing on a less meat-heavy diet could make a major difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Think twice about how much animal protein you buy and where you buy it,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Quammen also advised people 'think twice about having children and think twice about how many children you have and how much you add to the human population on this planet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 06:49:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxONUp3alNSbkZxQ2IxR2RKSnJDUFVUM0F6MnZiLVZ0am5JWWFJRmxySkhBWXFqdXhOOEowVDBPUFluZURUQ3BkUjVXeElzeFhRcHhFTnpRSlA0S3lUNFd2cEduZlR2MW9xY1pxR3EtSXFVNXN2X09LV0JGSGVKMElSQjdXNC1xMEI4bUswWENzQ2h5WnI3Y3ZoVkhxSUhCeWNwNU5ySjlpU0g0WG9iR2JLT3FKZnRkNXN0Wmhra0d2amM</guid></item><item><title>Confirmed measles case in King County infant prompts health warnings, parental concern - KOMO News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxObWFWOTdMTWxuZWpYNTMyYVR3MDZkUk1EbzZKWDhKVDVkalYxSWJHaHlkcGQ2UUFOSk51VmNXQ2ZValN2YjU1eEx5SWloUm85TXhBNnRCV0Rlb0oyVkRtdENYSzlYeVV3Sjl6azVPemJIYndHX1lVa1NYUTNmX2NYT29LQmVLd3ZkNGc0SkF6V3haMXRjbnRUYWZEV3FHY1hLa1JvV3lGN093eUF0OFdla2tiQ2pJSndMS2QxeEgyN0dVbExBQUwwY3B1aDk5Y3RVR0hNUC16d2l2azN4MDdsZWdMYnV2dWFwc0VsVS13?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;Health officials in King County are urging caution &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;following the first confirmed case of measles in Washington state this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King County infant,&lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;

The vaccinations provide 97% protection once both shots are administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high protection rate the vaccinations give, some parents remain concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There’s still a 3% chance of them contracting the disease, and again, I hope that doesn’t happen and it’s less likely, but it’s all risks,” parent Molly Gray told KOMO News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents like Gray are ensuring their children are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually just called our doctor to make sure our 4-year-old was fully vaccinated because I think 4 is the age where they can have their second dose and we double-checked because we want them to be as protected as possible," Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvia Maggio, another parent, expressed relief at having vaccinated her children but acknowledged the vulnerability of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We got the alerts about where that child had been, and we had also been to the ER at Seattle Children’s in recent weeks,” said Maggio. “I feel grateful that we’ve had the opportunity to get those MMR vaccinations out of the way but there are a lot of vulnerable children who don’t have that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials advise checking vaccination status and recommend contacting a doctor before visiting if exposure or symptoms are suspected to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,” said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. “There’s only a few viruses that even come close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had measles once can’t get it again, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got” measles, Weaver said. "But then when the vaccine came along, that was a complete game-changer and one of the most successful vaccines in the history of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is “great data” on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any of these outbreaks we’re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,” he said. “If we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we’re not going to see this happening in the future. And we’ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press reporter Laura Ungar contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 04:07:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxObWFWOTdMTWxuZWpYNTMyYVR3MDZkUk1EbzZKWDhKVDVkalYxSWJHaHlkcGQ2UUFOSk51VmNXQ2ZValN2YjU1eEx5SWloUm85TXhBNnRCV0Rlb0oyVkRtdENYSzlYeVV3Sjl6azVPemJIYndHX1lVa1NYUTNmX2NYT29LQmVLd3ZkNGc0SkF6V3haMXRjbnRUYWZEV3FHY1hLa1JvV3lGN093eUF0OFdla2tiQ2pJSndMS2QxeEgyN0dVbExBQUwwY3B1aDk5Y3RVR0hNUC16d2l2azN4MDdsZWdMYnV2dWFwc0VsVS13</guid></item><item><title>Concerning New Study Reveals That We Are No Longer Living Longer - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQZkxrQ01lUDNNRHBJV2lpNlQwN3hUUnNCaTZIc0VlU0xpU05DMFRvWXFvRnVOSVlnZlhXRGJaYm5NLURXclZ5VUVHaURfS21nVzJPOE5vOVpWS001NHZ0Y09PUV9UVUVrWVFqNHNfZF9wM0Flb0xrZUE0NEtSbE42NXRSbVZtckkwM0tod0JuQTJGMEFL?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 03:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQZkxrQ01lUDNNRHBJV2lpNlQwN3hUUnNCaTZIc0VlU0xpU05DMFRvWXFvRnVOSVlnZlhXRGJaYm5NLURXclZ5VUVHaURfS21nVzJPOE5vOVpWS001NHZ0Y09PUV9UVUVrWVFqNHNfZF9wM0Flb0xrZUE0NEtSbE42NXRSbVZtckkwM0tod0JuQTJGMEFL</guid></item><item><title>Health officials say they have a confirmed measles case reported in Austin - KVUE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNR25GdUFGWXdPQnlFQjJvLVZWMGZQb2JWalVteUR1cWo0RnQ1a1hjOS1ZYUtuc0tVenJxVlJwbUFTbHp5empMNGpiR0xaTWFKaTRIOER6WFNNRk8zR3Znbi1xdjNPNkktMS1vR3hBRzd2cWNFdVdaVGU1WldEaUp5Z2x6bDByRHc1aHM2aGZ5ZHpRMkRBSU1qRXktZDJacTR3enFwNTAyNnlVdTQ0S2RISmpXR01aUDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Most of the recent confirmed measles cases in Texas have been in the South Plains region, but this patient was exposed to the disease while traveling overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — Health officials say they have confirmed a case of measles in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a press briefing Friday, Austin Public Health confirmed that an unvaccinated infant was exposed to measles while traveling overseas. Everyone else in the child's family is vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is complete and they don't expect additional exposures. The child and their family members are all isolated at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It certainly raises our level of concern, our level of readiness, but we've been ready," Austin Travis County Public Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said. "We've been planning for over a year for the possibility of a measles outbreak because we've known that our vaccination rate has been declining. We've been working hard to get people vaccinated, and we're calling for people to get vaccinated now, if they're unvaccinated, to protect themselves."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes said the case is not related to an ongoing measles outbreak in the South Plains region of Texas, where &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-dded2ec7-e37b-42f7-8adb-2956fdb329bc"&gt;146 cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday, Feb. 28. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child has died, marking the first &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af"&gt;measles death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. To give you a sense of how contagious this virus is, doctors say if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles virus can survive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected person has left the area," Walkes said. "People who have direct contact through coughs or sneezes should monitor for symptoms for up to 21 days after exposure."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health officials stress that there is no local outbreak, but they say now is the time to take precautions and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR – measles-mumps-rubella – vaccine is highly effective in protecting against measles. According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), one dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles and two doses are 97% effective against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know how to combat this, and we need that vaccination rate to increase in our community by coming together, getting vaccinated, and prioritizing public health," Travis County Judge Andy Brown said. "We can do this together. The steps are simple. Get vaccinated if you haven't already."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to state health data, Travis County's MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners is just under 90%. Doctors say communities need 95% immunization rates to have "herd immunity."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that worries local leaders is the under 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners at some schools, which health officials said increases the risk of an outbreak by 51%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're continuing to work with those school administrators to get vaccines in arms," Walkes said. "We've been having clinics. Our mobile team has been educating families, and we're continuing that work and that effort. It'll be ongoing until we get the job done and get the message to parents that need to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said kids as young as a year old can get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second when they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If everybody else had their kids vaccinated at the proper ages, this would not be an issue," Brown said. "By not vaccinating your child at the proper ages of 12 to 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years, you're putting other infant children at risk. You're putting our community's lives at risk. You're putting our economy's life at risk."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a parent is going to an area where measles is prevalent, Walkes said the child should be vaccinated earlier, at six to eleven months. Walkes said that guidance may change if we see more cases in the Austin area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we do have an outbreak where we see more than three or more cases in our area, then we will change our guidance," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), of the 146 cases, 98 have been reported in Gaines County, and 21 have been reported in nearby Terry County. Most of the cases have been among children. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHS reports that 79 of the 146 patients were unvaccinated, 62 have unknown vaccination status, and five have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no local outbreak right now, Walkes said she and her team are prepared for the worst but are hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been in contact with our hospital partners and clinics and folks across our jurisdiction, and they are ready and prepared and have processes in place to handle people who may contact them saying that they have symptoms of measles," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another primary concern for local leaders is South by Southwest (SXSW) starting next weekend. As hundreds of thousands of people descend upon Downtown Austin, they don't want that to become a super spreader event. They are encouraging those in the community who aren't vaccinated to get vaccinated. The city and health department say they are working with organizers on health precautions for the event.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We work in collaboration with Austin Special Events to help them mitigate and strategize for health precautions for events," Walkes said. "Our team has been in contact with them and our business partners across the city."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to get the vaccine can do so at doctor's offices and pharmacies. The health department offers the MMR vaccine at its "Shots for Tots" and "Big Shots" clinics. You can find information about those &lt;a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/immunizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Children under the age of 14 do need a prescription from a doctor to get the vaccine at a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

That includes the latest teen death, a 16-year-old girl from inland North County who died on Feb. 11. She did not have underlying medical conditions, according to the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of teen deaths is significantly higher than is usually the case. Generally, only one or two teens die from influenza each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,224 new flu cases were reported to the county health department last week, slightly fewer than the 1,932 reported two weeks ago. The season total now stands at 34,192 flu cases, nearly double the 19,035 recorded in the entirety of the 2023-24 flu year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency departments saw a significant dip in flu activity last week with 6 percent of visits exhibiting flu symptoms compared to 9 percent two weeks ago. But those numbers remain elevated over the prior five-year average of 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

And then it's like, 'Oh, the right side of my body is dipping,'" she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, Walsh wasn't sure what was going on, especially since people kept telling her she was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They're like, 'Oh, you're off.' I'm like 'No,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walsh also felt strange while walking her dog one day and recalled thinking the street must be "windy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was just sort of very subtle and then very kind of, 'Oh it's ADD. I can't really focus. Oh I've been scrolling too much.' That kind of stuff," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Going through this health scare taught Walsh a lesson that she's hoping to share with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I know how important it is to advocate for one's own health because people were like, You're just depressed.' It was right after (my TV show) 'Bad Judge' got canceled. 'Your show got canceled. You're just depressed,'" she recalled others saying. "I'm like, 'No something's off.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Walsh appeared on "The Kelly Clarkson Show" on Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Walsh acknowledged that it's challenging to advocate for yourself in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's a hard thing when you have everybody looking at you going, 'Hmm, I think you're just this or that. You're tired,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2017, Walsh &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/kate-walsh-opens-about-being-diagnosed-very-sizable-brain-tumor-t116425" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:appeared on TODAY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;appeared on TODAY&lt;/a&gt; to discuss her diagnosis and recovery.

So I thought I just really burned myself out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon enough, Walsh started experiencing cognitive symptoms and "couldn't find my words."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After fighting for a diagnostic MRI, Walsh learned that she had a “very sizable tumor.” Following a surgery, she discovered that it was benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The non-cancerous tumor was known as a meningioma, which &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/meningioma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;John Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; defines as "the most common type of primary brain tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These tumors originate in the meninges, which are the outer three layers of tissue between the skull and the brain that cover and protect the brain just under the skull," the John Hopkins Medicine website reads.

			&lt;p&gt;When Kim Kardashian &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; about having had a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/keeping-up-with-advanced-mri-kim-kardashian-promotes-whole-body-scans-could-they-be-worth-the-hype-211676"&gt;full-body MRI&lt;/a&gt;, she enthused that the test can be "life saving", detecting diseases in the earliest stages before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Kardashian neglected to say was there's no evidence this expensive scan can bring benefits for &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;healthy people&lt;/a&gt;. She also didn't mention it can carry harms including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00679-4"&gt;unnecessary diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post in mind, we wanted to explore what influencers are telling us about medical tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, we analyzed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about five popular medical tests which can all do more harm than good to healthy people, including the full-body  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the overwhelming majority of these posts were utterly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5 controversial tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the details of what we found, a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2024/1/e56899"&gt;the five tests&lt;/a&gt; included in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tests can be valuable to some, all five carry the risk of overdiagnosis for generally healthy people. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-warning-signs-of-overdiagnosis-110895"&gt;Overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is the diagnosis of a condition which would have never caused symptoms or problems. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, which can cause unnecessary side effects and stress for the person, and wasted resources for the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/29-000-cancers-overdiagnosed-in-australia-in-a-single-year-127791"&gt;29,000 cancers a year are overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; in Australia alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overdiagnosis is a global problem, and it's driven in part by healthy people having tests like these. Often, they're promoted under the guise of early screening, as a way to "take control" of your health. But most healthy people simply don't need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five tests we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;full-body MRI scan&lt;/strong&gt; claims to test for up to 500 conditions, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Yet there is no proven benefit of the scan for healthy people, and a real risk of unnecessary treatment from "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;false alarm&lt;/a&gt;" diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;"egg timer" test&lt;/strong&gt; (technically known as the AMH, or anti-mullarian hormone test) is often falsely promoted as a fertility test for healthy women. While it may be beneficial for women within a fertility clinic setting, it cannot reliably predict the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2656811"&gt;chance of a woman conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/3/327/6990969?login=true"&gt;menopause starting&lt;/a&gt;. However, low results can &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0167482X.2018.1541980?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#abstract"&gt;increase fear and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to unnecessary and expensive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29719026/"&gt;fertility treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-cancer early detection blood tests&lt;/strong&gt; are being heavily marketed as the "holy grail of cancer detection", with claims they can screen for more than 50 cancers. In reality,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still a long way from finished. There's &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1706"&gt;no good evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that the benefits will outweigh the harms of unnecessary cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiome test&lt;/strong&gt; of your stool promises "wellness" via early detection of many conditions, from flatulence to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, again &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/well/live/microbiome-test.html"&gt;without good evidence of benefit&lt;/a&gt;. There's also concern that test results can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2019-0122/html"&gt;wasted resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testosterone testing&lt;/strong&gt; in healthy men is not supported by any high-quality evidence, with concerns direct-to-consumer advertising &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2612615"&gt;leads men to get tested and take testosterone replacement therapy unnecessarily&lt;/a&gt;. Use of testosterone replacement therapy carries its own risk of potential harms with the long-term safety in relation to heart disease and mortality &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666756822000964?via%3Dihub"&gt;still largely unknown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with an international group of health researchers, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;we analyzed 982 posts&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the above tests from across Instagram and TikTok. The posts we looked at came from influencers and account holders with at least 1,000 followers, some with a few million followers. In total, the creators of the posts we included had close to 200 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even discounting the bots, that's a massive amount of influence (and likely doesn't reflect their actual reach to non-followers too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of posts were misleading, failing to even mention the possibility of harm arising from taking one of these tests. We found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 percent of posts mentioned test benefits, while only 15 percent mentioned potential harms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts mentioned the risk of overdiagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts discussed any scientific evidence, while 34 percent of posts used personal stories to promote the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 percent of influencers and account holders had financial interests in promoting the test (for example, a partnership, collaboration, sponsorship or selling for their own profit in some way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed medical doctors were slightly more balanced in their posts. They were more likely to mention the harms of the test, and less likely to have a strongly promotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all studies do, ours had some limitations. For example, we didn't analyze comments connected to posts. These may give further insights into the information being provided about these tests, and how social media users perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, our findings add to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470931/"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing misleading medical information is widespread on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg" alt="Person being prepared for a scan in an MRI machine" class="wp-image-153582 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-blue-denim-jeans-lying-on-bed-f2aDTqfnqfE"&gt;National Cancer Institute/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have proposed a range of solutions including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-we-be-inoculated-against-climate-misinformation-yes-if-we-prebunk-rather-than-debunk-215815"&gt;pre-bunking strategies&lt;/a&gt;, which means proactively educating the public about common misinformation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, solutions like these often place responsibility on the individual. And with all the information on social media to navigate, that's a big ask, even for people with adequate health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's urgently needed is stronger regulation to prevent misleading information being created and shared in the first place. This is especially important given social media platforms including Instagram are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/meta-is-abandoning-fact-checking-this-doesnt-bode-well-for-the-fight-against-misinformation-246878"&gt;moving away from fact-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, remember that if information about medical tests promoted by influencers sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247362/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as “a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual” – and one “that arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?","elementId":"384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/18/men-say-i-love-you-first-but-are-they-really-more-romantic-than-women"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said that definition was “not perfect” but was “the scientifically most useful and most precise”. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it “doesn’t have all its features until puberty”, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/feb/10/1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hormones and blood neurotransmitter levels&lt;/a&gt; and is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to “companionate love”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In some cases it persists longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said this was “the first paper to empirically show that we don’t all love the same”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn’t shown it before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/15/love-story-australian-researchers-becoming-world-leaders-in-the-study-of-romantic-love" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Romantic Love Survey 2022&lt;/a&gt; of 1,556 people, the world’s largest dataset of people in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode’s team identified four major “clusters”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by “the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex”. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate: &lt;/strong&gt;About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense: &lt;/strong&gt;This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libidinous: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a “robust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love” used cross-culturally, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0140-1971%2886%2980043-4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;developed in 1986&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by “whatever they thought it meant”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The authors of the new study suggested it might “be fruitful” to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Romantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,” Bode said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Humans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 23:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbXBLbXA2NUlXaHBUSW4xVkVOclNmM3F3RUtQRkVKdlQxVTJtbkpxWXRxRzZUTDQ3azR2THFfSFlSZ0FWbk1FOUdjcFMyV255V1ZseUtGcS0wb1ExXzFObjl6aWRaYVBKWWxQamxndklPNklLQ3U4MklWTlV1S0t3UGZRcjdxY3dEZ3ZjTzdGbzRkRmhsRUlmNm1fWDZzeGRhOVFnY3E3R2hHV2RWdlVHR2Y4VDEzUHQ4YnJTOGVMZw</guid></item><item><title>Short-Term Junk Food Diet Reduces Brain’s Insulin Sensitivity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE43RmJaNC1nMzlMWXBhRERQUkZkY2swNm1CUWhuMGVCSjFGWnpieWZWVTg2cDhKQjZnU1gycGdjQjEzRUJyVHlTVVJJLWdONTBPX0lkVTk1QlhUTEE5RUtzeXlKRWNFdXhWTjhLVzRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that consuming high-calorie, highly processed foods for just five days can reduce the brain’s sensitivity to insulin, a key factor in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that even in healthy individuals, short-term unhealthy eating altered brain function, mimicking effects seen in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sing MRI scans, they observed that reduced insulin sensitivity persisted even a week after returning to a normal diet. These findings suggest that the brain adapts rapidly to dietary changes, potentially contributing to long-term weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Just five days of a high-calorie diet reduced brain insulin sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulin resistance in the brain persisted even after resuming a normal diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; This effect mirrors insulin resistance seen in people with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of obese persons has grown significantly in recent decades, which presents significant difficulties for those who are impacted, healthcare systems, and those who provide treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone insulin plays a key role in the development of obesity. Up until recently, there have been numerous signs indicating insulin causes neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108002"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the University Hospital of Tübingen, the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), and Helmholtz Munich offers intriguing new insights into the origins of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as the brain’s function as a critical control center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obesity has only been officially recognized as a disease in Germany since 2020, despite the fact that it has long been known to cause a number of illnesses, including diabetes, heart attacks, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has already declared obesity to be an epidemic, affecting over one billion individuals globally and almost 16 million in Germany alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese, and a poor diet and insufficient exercise are frequently cited as the causes of this chronic illness. However, the mechanisms in the body that lead to obesity and cause the disease are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Obesity and the role of insulin in the brain &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. What specific functions does insulin perform in the brain, and how does it affect individuals of normal weight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Prof. Dr. Stephanie Kullmann and her colleagues at the Tübingen University Hospital for Diabetology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology found the answer to this query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate for the first time that even a brief consumption of highly processed, unhealthy foods (such as chocolate bars and potato chips) causes a significant alteration in the brain of healthy individuals, which may be the initial cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes,” says Prof. Kullmann, the study’s leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a healthy state, insulin has an appetite-suppressing effect in the brain. However, in people with obesity in particular, insulin no longer regulates eating behavior properly, resulting in insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, in our healthy study participants, the brain shows a similar decrease in sensitivity to insulin after a short-term high calorie intake as in people with obesity,” says Ms. Kullmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This effect can even be observed one week after returning to a balanced diet,” she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also deputy head of the Metabolic Neuroimaging department at the DZD partner Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Munich at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Focus on the brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, Medical Director of Internal Medicine IV, Director of the IDM and DZD Board Member, and the study’s final author, concludes, “We assume that the brain’s insulin response adapts to short-term changes in diet before any weight gain occurs and thus promotes the development of obesity and other secondary diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urges more research on how the brain contributes to the development of obesity and other metabolic illnesses in light of the current findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Short period with far-reaching effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 male volunteers of average weight participated in the study and were split into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five days in a row, the first group had to supplement their regular diet with 1500 kcal from highly processed, high-calorie snacks. The extra calories were not consumed by the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups underwent two separate examinations following an initial evaluation. One examination was conducted immediately following the five-day period, and another was conducted seven days after the first group had resumed their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver’s fat content and the brain’s insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the fat content of the liver of the first group increase significantly after five days of increased calorie intake. Surprisingly, the significantly lower insulin sensitivity in the brain compared to the control group also persisted one week after returning to a normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect had previously only been observed in obese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8afbdbabdaa98bca2bcf5bdaef6bcbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katrin Weber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katrin Weber – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01226-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Kullmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain insulin responsiveness is linked to long-term weight gain and unhealthy body fat distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that short-term overeating with calorie-rich sweet and fatty foods triggers liver fat accumulation and disrupted brain insulin action that outlasted the time-frame of its consumption in healthy weight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, brain response to insulin can adapt to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At least 60 people have died and more than 1,000 have been sickened in Congo’s Équateur Province by the illness, which is characterized by “fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea,” according to the latest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-deepens-investigation-cluster-illness-and-community-deaths-equateur?country=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo&amp;amp;name=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;W.H.O. report&lt;/a&gt;

But the day before her surgery, she received a shocking call from her doctor: A routine screening had revealed a malignant tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Two thousand things were going through my mind,” said Kaufman, an executive coach and the author of “Crushing the Cancer Curveball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She couldn’t form a coherent thought beyond: What should I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A diagnosis of a serious illness can be overwhelming, whether it’s happening to you or someone you love.
