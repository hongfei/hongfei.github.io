It was the same table where I’d sat through both of my pregnancies and where, three years earlier, I’d been diagnosed with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry,” my doctor said. “I know how it feels to go through menopause. Especially since you went through it overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the one who diagnosed me with cancer. I’d found a small lump on my right breast and called her office immediately. Our appointment fell on Halloween 2017, and she was dressed up as Snow White, wearing full face paint and a black wig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are one of the lucky ones,” she said, as I sat on the table and cried. “You don’t need chemotherapy, and you’re going to be okay.” My doctor was right — I was lucky. I’d caught it early, and with breast cancer, early detection is everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My treatment consisted of a mastectomy, reconstruction surgery and 10 years of targeted hormone therapy — to kill the estrogen in my body and lower my risk of recurrent cancer. The goal of these hormone treatments — for pre-menopausal women — is to slingshot you through menopause. It worked. Within a matter of weeks, I went from being a healthy 37-year-old menstruating woman, to a hot-flashing, bone-aching, post-menopausal cancer survivor. I suffered vaginal irritation, something I’d later learn was vaginal atrophy. The only thing not atrophying were my post-operative breasts — they looked perkier than ever. But while my boobs felt 16 again, my vagina felt 61. It was a total mindfuck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It hurts,” I complained. “Just... all the time. And especially during sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause makes it very uncomfortable — nearly impossible — to have successful intercourse,” she said matter-of-factly. “Have you heard of vaginal rejuvenation? A colleague of mine, in Albuquerque, is offering laser treatment in her practice. I think you’d be a great candidate for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author taking a selfie during her first mammogram appointment. "I didn't know at that time what was ahead of me," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later I was home, googling laser vaginal rejuvenation. Eventually, I found a reputable women’s healthcare site with information on the treatment. Above the medical description, there was a photo of a smiling woman in her 60s, wearing a pink button up shirt. She had done the treatments and seemed to be enjoying “successful intercourse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of vaginal rejuvenation treatment I was considering, “gently rejuvenates” the vagina, by delivering a type of therapy known as fractional CO2 (carbon dioxide) laser energy to the soft tissues of the vaginal wall and providing a hormone-free treatment for vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy — for those who have not yet journeyed into the Saharan desert of menopause — is next-level vaginal dryness. It’s a side effect of menopause — practically a guarantee. For many women and people with vaginas, vaginal estrogen creams can provide sufficient relief for the pain experienced during intercourse caused by vaginal atrophy. For women like me — who are proactively killing the estrogen inside their bodies with mega medications — the research remains ongoing about estrogen creams, rings and tablets, and whether they are safe to use. Right now, it’s not something I am comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited to discuss what I’d learned with my husband. In the throes of parenting two toddlers — while also recovering from a life-threatening illness — addressing sexual dysfunction was on our to-do list but hadn’t yet become a crisis in our marriage. Together we defined two major drawbacks to the treatment. The first was the price tag. The laser treatment consists of three sessions, distanced a few months apart. I was quoted $3,000 in total for the three sessions. Insurance does not cover the cost of vaginal rejuvenation, although you might be able to get reimbursed through a flexible spending account (FSA). I don’t have one of those. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second concern was the risk. Most of the websites I researched did not mention any risk involved with the treatment. But there is, of course, risk when you decide to have your vagina lasered. Some women have experienced excruciating pain during the treatment and — in very rare cases — suffered vaginal burns. Despite all that and because I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the treatment and could afford it, I decided to try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, Alex, at the Inn in Vermont where they got married. "This was on our 8th wedding anniversary," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was taking in the desert mesas on my way to Albuquerque for my first laser treatment. When I arrived at the small gynecology practice, I was greeted by a young and chipper receptionist. I told her in a quiet voice that I was there for vaginal rejuvenation. She asked me to repeat myself. I did. She giggled nervously and asked me to wait. I watched her consult with a co-worker before returning to the window. “I’m sorry,” she said with amusement. “I hadn’t heard of that before.” I shot her a look that was meant to say, &lt;em&gt;menopause is coming for you too, young lady. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was led to an examining room and given a gown. A nurse entered the room and applied a numbing cream to my labia. As I waited to go numb, I spotted the laser treatment in the corner of the room. It was a tall machine with a long, slender wand. It looked like something you might see at a dentist’s office. Then the gynecologist walked in — an older, soft-spoken, hippy-ish woman — and told me how excited she was to have the opportunity to perform the treatment. “Have you used the laser before?” I asked nervously. “Only a few times,” she responded. I tried to ignore the sudden wave of panic that washed over me. She turned on the machine and it made a loud, vibrating noise. As I laid back, a tagline from an old Virginia Slims commercial popped into my mind: &lt;em&gt;You’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial treatment went well. For a few days, I experienced some light vaginal bleeding, which was to be expected. The laser creates tiny micro-abrasions on the vaginal wall, increasing blood flow and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels — essentially bringing new life to your vagina. I didn’t feel any pain during the treatment, although it was a bit uncomfortable and awkward. After the first session, I noticed something right away. My vagina seemed happier. In fact, it didn’t hurt ― at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gynecologist told me to have sex in-between the sessions, to help maintain my new elasticity. I was feeling so bolstered from the positive results of the first treatment, I couldn’t wait to jump into bed with my husband. But when it came time to get down to business, I was extremely disappointed to find out penetration remained very painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry,” I said to my husband, after we tried — unsuccessfully — to have sex. “I can’t do this, it hurts too much.” I was in tears. We both were frustrated. &lt;em&gt;Would I ever have sex again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, her husband and two children on Halloween 2017, a few hours after her doctor diagnosed her with breast cancer. "We are trick-or-treating on Canyon Road in Santa Fe, New Mexico," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I brought this question to my next appointment in Albuquerque. My gynecologist told me to wait to finish all three treatments before coming to any conclusions. But the results from the second treatment weren’t all that noteworthy. And the same was true for the third and final treatment. It seemed to me the major benefits of vaginal rejuvenation occurred after the first treatment. It had a very positive effect on the overall wellbeing of my vagina but didn’t fix the painful symptoms I was experiencing during intercourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months after my initial doctor’s visit, I was back in the examining room detailing my experience. My doctor and I agreed that researching and devoting more funds to women’s health has a long way to go. Most women can’t afford expensive vaginal laser treatments, and instead, are learning to normalize their pain or simply avoid talking about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did vaginal rejuvenation fix the painful symptoms I experienced during sex? No. Do I feel comfortable using an estrogen cream? Again, no. But I think of the waiting room at the Dana Farber Cancer Center — and I guess I can live with it. The question is, why should I? Why is there a little blue pill for erections and not an effective medication for vaginal dryness? Yet again, it seems we have been given the shaft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before I left, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Lidocaine, a numbing cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Put this on twenty minutes before sex, it really helps,” she said. Before she left the room she turned and gave me a half smile, as if to say, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcome to menopause, we’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But have we? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few other non-estrogen vaginal atrophy treatments out there — and maybe someday I’ll try them. For now, my partner and I are exploring what “successful intercourse” means to us. Penetration is only one way of having sex — there are lots of fun things to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

              &lt;p&gt;After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966582"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966595"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What’s more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We mostly all have the same genes across species,” Gregg said. “The big change is in the 98% of the genome that does not encode for genes.” Non-coding DNA is largely responsible for gene regulation. In hibernators, specific regions of non-coding DNA act as “master switches” for controlling functional gene responses to starvation and refeeding, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack. To accomplish this, the researchers made whole-genome comparisons across mammals to identify conserved DNA regions that are stable in most species but show accelerated change in hibernators. These hibernator-accelerated regions are regulators that turn genes on in specific cells at specific times, Elliott Ferris, a data analyst in Gregg’s lab at U of U and first author of one of the studies, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand the biological processes that may be linked to these hibernator-accelerated regions, the researchers identified genes that get turned up or turned down during fasting in mice. Hibernation is an adaptation to survive food scarcity, so fasting triggers similar metabolic changes. This led them to “hub genes” that act as master regulators for fasting-induced changes to gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The really surprising discovery that was very exciting was that the hibernation-linked elements are disproportionately affecting those key hub genes,” Gregg explained. “The implication is that hibernators changed the regulation and activity of these core hub genes to have big downstream effects on the whole program for responding to food scarcity and food deprivation. That’s important as we think about translating this knowledge into the real world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gregg is co-founder of Primordial AI, a Utah-based biotech startup that leverages AI to uncover master regulator gene drug targets. Through this company, he aims to develop drugs that mimic the genetic advantages hibernators have, such as boosting neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s patients or reversing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. “Those hub genes are the ones that we think are a really good starting point to design medicines to affect those genes,” Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They're called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW2eGaUzq7E" target="_blank"&gt;Demodex&lt;/a&gt;, and they feast on the greasy oil (sebum) in your pores! These microscopic 8-legged arachnids are related to ticks and spiders. They don't have an anus or eyes. It's more than likely that you have dozens of them on you at this very minute. They spend most of their time near your hair follicles. They "crawl out to the surface and mate, before crawling back into your pores to lay their eggs." It's impossible to truly rid your body of all of them, so don't waste your time trying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They found that people diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CUD&lt;/a&gt;) were 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer within five years than those without the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elevated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-in-any-form-directly-linked-to-significant-risk-of-heart-damage/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; held even after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, and tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/raphael.cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Raphael E. Cuomo, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of the &lt;a href="https://moorescancercenter.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Moores Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, led the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that the findings dovetail with toxicology data showing cannabis smoke carries many of the same chemicals blamed for tobacco related malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-use-linked-to-oral-cancer"&gt;Cannabis use linked to oral cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legalization has widened access to cannabis, yet roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16854249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three-in-ten&lt;/a&gt; regular users meet criteria for the disorder, a clinical diagnosis that signals problematic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike casual &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/legal-access-to-cannabis-is-proving-to-be-good-for-both-people-and-society/"&gt;consumption&lt;/a&gt;, CUD typically involves near daily smoking, deeper inhalation, and higher potency products that bathe oral tissues in combustion by products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; estimates about 59,660 Americans will be told they have cancers of the mouth or throat in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking remains a leading risk factor, but human papillomavirus (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;), heavy drinking, and now cannabis may add new layers to that risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral tumors often begin as painless spots on the lip or tongue, making early detection tricky. By linking CUD and tumor incidence in electronic health records, the &lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt; team offers clinicians a fresh flag for vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-raises-cancer-risk"&gt;Cannabis raises cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study drew data from six academic medical centers between 2012 and 2019, then tracked each participant for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 2.1 percent developed CUD, yet that small group accounted for nearly a third of the oral cancer diagnoses observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;Tobacco smokers&lt;/a&gt; in the cohort already faced extra danger, but those who both smoked cigarettes and had CUD were six times more likely to be diagnosed than smokers without CUD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cannabis signal persisted inside the smoking subgroup, Cuomo’s team suspects mechanisms beyond simple smoke exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that women, older age, and higher body mass index appeared to slightly temper risk, echoing patterns seen with tobacco related oral cancers. However, those demographic buffers did not erase the impact of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoke-harms-mouth-tissue"&gt;Smoke harms mouth tissue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18062674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; show that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-03/documents/pahs_factsheet_cdc_2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAHs&lt;/a&gt;), benzene, and ammonia, many at concentrations equal to or higher than tobacco sidestream smoke. Several of these compounds directly damage DNA in epithelial cells lining the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed chemical fingerprint published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63120-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; cataloged 2,575 distinct compounds in mainstream cannabis smoke, 110 of which are known human toxicants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such particle rich aerosols stick to mucosal surfaces, extending contact time between carcinogens and target cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histology from habitual marijuana smokers has revealed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9719080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dysplasia&lt;/a&gt; and other precancerous changes in bronchial tissue even when tobacco is absent. Those cellular alterations mirror the earliest steps seen on the path to malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-affects-cancer-defense"&gt;Cannabis affects cancer defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetrahydrocannabinol (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;), the main psychoactive molecule in cannabis, can impair &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18040791/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune suppression&lt;/a&gt; pathways that normally patrol for rogue cells. Less immune surveillance could give mutated oral cells a head start toward tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible or vaporized products bypass the oral cavity, yet frequent users often combine delivery methods, so risk patterns for noncombustible forms remain unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies that separate smoke exposure from total THC dose may untangle these variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether the rising average potency of commercial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-potency-why-you-shouldnt-trust-the-label/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; accelerates carcinogen uptake or immune effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public laboratories have only begun to simulate how today’s 25 percent THC flower compares with the 4 percent material studied decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-users-face-big-risk"&gt;Daily users face big risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD commonly face co-occurring mental health challenges, alcohol misuse, and lower participation in preventive dental care. These overlapping factors could compound cancer risk and delay diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic gaps may also play a role, because uninsured adults are less likely to receive routine oral examinations. Community clinics that integrate substance use counseling with oral screenings could bridge that divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, the takeaway is straightforward. When a patient meets criteria for CUD, adding a quick inspection of the mouth and a referral to dentistry costs little but may spot trouble early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heavy-cannabis-harms-oral-health"&gt;Heavy cannabis harms oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is not just a milder cousin of tobacco, its smoke delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;complex chemical load&lt;/a&gt; with measurable impacts on human tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC San Diego study reminds us that heavy, prolonged use carries consequences that legalization debates often overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers weighing retail expansion should ensure that cancer prevention messaging keeps pace with marketing. Clear warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs, could help users make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, anyone lighting up daily can lower potential harm by switching to noncombustible products, spacing out sessions, and keeping regular dental check ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will continue probing dose, delivery, and biology, but prudence starts with individual habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth,” noted Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying aware of that simple fact may be the first step toward safer choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preventive Medicine Report&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-0b46afe3-5373-4d7b-b149-ae51b4185ee8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-94c7e0c5-6e44-4b60-b48d-91c9796c24f4"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-443f8909-7106-405a-b093-e9b4bd7024ee"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-4454416d-6e1a-4eaf-b811-4a941bc234b2"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:14:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaGV3ZzMtc0pSczFYMld2d2kwa1dockxuQjRlTW5nTXQ4SGlJeGhhekliWktTY2lJVkJVQklOV214b0NaeGFTQ0pEbF9Rc3BfcXBaeV9aeHRfV01SWnU3azc0TjkyVjVHUEFoQnM0dktrVDMxeXFxR1ZXZ0pUOGsyc3dvbldDbl9vRkFvRzFYNHg1d2VuZ3RIZXZMOHFtaklaYmw2eHJkeVI</guid></item><item><title>“日本散步”是值得尝试的健身趋势-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxONVFpNWxIT2Fob0RJcFY1a0NxSWludzZROXBmZzM0ZFVPaVdFTlp6Y2JaME5hOGdmNU1sZldxQlJ4czFCd0NkeXQwNWRKWlR5VUxTRWxvclM5c25EUERHSE4zY0dlanRwdEo3RHBtQV9lbW45am9IQ240bkpIMVNPekJCZFFwSm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:05:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxONVFpNWxIT2Fob0RJcFY1a0NxSWludzZROXBmZzM0ZFVPaVdFTlp6Y2JaME5hOGdmNU1sZldxQlJ4czFCd0NkeXQwNWRKWlR5VUxTRWxvclM5c25EUERHSE4zY0dlanRwdEo3RHBtQV9lbW45am9IQ240bkpIMVNPekJCZFFwSm8</guid></item><item><title>Wyomissing发现狂犬病阳性病例- WFMZ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPVnRsdXJSRDF3aHptLVByakF2MGx0TFZGRW9VUFY2MXdVNjU4THZQejJSQmR3WlBDSkVKS2ZrYWl3b0pnM3hETzNjaTBHQzJDQ3hmWnlTM3VGZmF6Q1FBWm9tQ3pibUlQTFlXUFJLZFN6cTN6TXFiZHhDNXRfQ0Q0ay1DRXUyMWF3S2o0TUlKNVV4M0tNa0tiVlNMY0N0Mk9CZDJuVUdscGhHMGhHc3VRam1LQXpKeVVlYzZseHp6T2JuMm9PdmdyMERweHU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A potential new male contraceptive drug has just undergone its first tests in human volunteers. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01004-4"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; give the first indication that the drug, which does not use artificial hormones or affect testosterone production by the testes, may be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous attempts have been made to develop a male contraceptive in the past, these largely failed to pass  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; due to their unacceptable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this newest contraceptive works differently from past attempts, which means it doesn't require surgery and is much less likely to cause hormonal side effects – problems that have helped stop previous attempts from reaching the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed the drug was well tolerated in a small group of healthy young men and did not appear to cause any serious side effects at the doses used. Further research will be needed to demonstrate precisely how effective it is as a contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-type-of-reversible-male-contraception-proves-a-success-in-mouse-study?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Type of Reversible Male Contraception Proves a Success in Mouse Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new method uses a specially designed chemical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782424005237"&gt;known as YCT-529&lt;/a&gt; to target a specific cell receptor in the testes called retinoic acid receptor–alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar, but less specific compounds, had been shown to reduce sperm production in humans previously. But these compounds also had unwanted side effects – such as feeling ill when &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2164/jandrol.110.010751"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, altering salt levels in the bloodstream and &lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(02)00294-9/abstract"&gt;not being fully reversible&lt;/a&gt; in all men. This made them unsuitable for contraceptive use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg" alt="man taking pill" class="wp-image-169661 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Previous attempts at a male contraceptive pill have proven unsuitable. (Ron Lach/Pexels/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00752-7"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, YCT-529 was shown to produce fully reversible, temporary infertility without any significant side effects. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/157/4/1601/2422643?login=true"&gt;study in mice&lt;/a&gt; also found that those who went on to father babies after stopping the drug produce normal, healthy offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the drug then entered into phase 1 trials in humans. This is the first stage of human testing, where a small group of healthy volunteers are recruited to test safety, tolerability, and possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small trial involved 16 male volunteers who took the drug twice at increasing doses – either 10mg to 30mg or 90mg to 180mg. Some men took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; pills for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were monitored for 15 days for any effects on normal hormone levels, inflammation (signs of cell damage), kidney and liver function, abnormal heart rhythms, sexual desire and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No changes were detected in the natural hormones in the body. There were also no lasting effects on liver and kidney function and no signs of cell damage. No dangerous abnormalities of heart rhythm were detected, and the participants reported no changes in mood or sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, participants only took two doses of the drug and were only followed up for 15 days. The authors say in the paper that a larger phase 2 trial is underway which will test the drug in a greater number of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will then be followed by phase 3 trials in hundreds of men where the effectiveness, reversibility and side effects of longer term use of the drug will be assessed. These are the hurdles which have prevented other approaches from being made widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why past male contraceptives have failed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present there are no commercially available contraceptive methods for men that are not only safe and effective at preventing pregnancy, but which also allow sperm production to be turned off and on again at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While condoms have few side effects and are used at will, they have a relatively &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/psrh.12017"&gt;high failure rate&lt;/a&gt; (resulting in pregnancy around 12%-18% of the time with typical use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vasectomy, which severs the tube connecting the sperm-producing testes to the rest of the male reproductive organs, is very effective (more than 99%) and safe – but it's not easily reversible and requires a minor operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg" alt="vasectomy diagram" class="wp-image-169659 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of a vasectomy. (Anna Bergbauer/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts (and some ongoing) at producing a reversible method of contraception for men. Some have proven to be effective at stopping sperm production or preventing sperm from exiting the male reproductive tract. However, they haven't moved to the stage of commercial production, often because of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these attempts used one of two main approaches to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-020-0099-1"&gt;One method&lt;/a&gt; involves injecting a substance into the vas deferens (a tube leading from the testes to the urethra). This substance filters out and damages sperm during ejaculation. This substance can be flushed out through a minor procedure if the man wishes to become fertile again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback of this method is that it requires a minor surgical procedure (an injection into the scrotum) and that the man has to have a further procedure to reverse its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second route involves stopping sperm production altogether by lowering the hormones that cause sperm to be made in the testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most successful of these trials used &lt;a href="https://srh.bmj.com/content/45/4/236"&gt;an injectable progestogen&lt;/a&gt; (a synthetic version of the sex hormone progesterone). This injectable signalled the brain to stop producing follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) and lutenising hormone (LH), which normally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8658012/#:%7E:text=These%20two%20hormones%20are%20composed,genitalia%20the%20maintenance%20of%20spermatogenesis"&gt;signal the testes&lt;/a&gt; to produce sperm and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, suppressing LH also turned off the testosterone in the testes that is needed for normal, healthy function in men. To counteract the loss of testosterone, this contraceptive approach required men to take an "add back" testosterone – either as a tablet or a gel applied to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110729-male-contraceptive-injection-works-but-side-effects-halt-trial/"&gt;major trial&lt;/a&gt; testing this method was stopped early because of the hormonal side effects participants experienced, including mood swings, acne and changes to sex drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go before the new drug can be considered suitable for use as a male contraceptive. But this new approach shows a lot of promise because it avoids upsetting hormonal balance and can be taken orally – rather than requiring an invasive procedure. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262083/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Five ZIP codes have been affected — 10027, 10030,10035, 10037 and 10039 — which generally stretch across Harlem from 116th to 155th streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="60ld3"&gt;City health officials declined to provide specific information on the person who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ibgl"&gt;“Anyone with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible," Dr. Toni Eyssallenne, deputy chief medical officer at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="arr1e"&gt;“Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early," she added. "But New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older, those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="27e8t"&gt;Health officials said cooling towers on buildings in the outbreak area had been tested for legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease, which can lead to severe pneumonia.

Legionnaires’ disease can be treated with antibiotics, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a908s"&gt;Symptoms usually show up within two to 14 days of exposure and include cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, shortness of breath, diarrhea, confusion and nausea.

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Cancer rates, particularly gastrointestinal cancers, continue to rise among young adults. (Photo by Frame Stock Footage on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans born in 1990 face a 4× higher risk of rectal cancer (and 2× higher for colon cancer) than those born in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Early-onset GI cancers rose 14.8% between 2010 and 2019; pancreatic rates climbed 4.34% per year in 25–29-year-olds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity (BMI ≥30), Western diets, and fatty liver disease drive most of these cancers, which are sporadic, not inherited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Younger patients often face delayed diagnoses, more aggressive treatment with marginal benefit, and greater “financial toxicity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans born in 1990 have four times the risk of developing rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950, according to a sweeping analysis that reveals how dramatically cancer patterns have shifted across generations. This alarming trend extends beyond a single cancer type; gastrointestinal cancers among people under 50 have surged by nearly 15% in just one decade, transforming diseases once considered rare in young people into leading killers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and led by researchers from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, the review examined cancer trends across multiple databases and studies. Between 2010 and 2019, cases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers jumped by 14.8%, with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; now ranking as the top cancer killer for men under 50 and second for women in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these cancers aren’t caused by inherited genetic defects. Instead, researchers point to environmental factors tied to modern life: soaring &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-causing-cancer-young-adults-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rates, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/colorectal-cancer-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets dominated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sedentary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, and exposures that previous generations simply didn’t face. “The rising incidence demonstrates a birth cohort effect, implicating environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increases hit certain groups hardest. Hispanic patients represent more than 22% of young adults diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt;, compared to just 7% of older patients. Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations face disproportionately higher rates of early-onset colorectal cancer compared to their White counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-young-adults"&gt;Why Cancer Rates Are Rising in Young Adults&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer incidence among Americans under 50 jumped from 5.9 cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 by 2017. Among adults aged 25–29, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pancreatic-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence climbed by 4.34% per year beginning in the mid-1990s. Stomach cancer rates rose by 1.6% per year among women under 50 between 2010 and 2019, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/esophageal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases increased by 6.86% per year in 30–39-year-olds and showed a steady early-onset rise overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These patterns mirror troubling trends worldwide, particularly in wealthy nations where Western lifestyles have taken hold. European countries reported significant increases in early-onset colorectal cancer from 2004 to 2016, with the steepest rises — 7.9%, 4.9%, and 1.6% per year — among people in their twenties, thirties, and forties, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several key factors appear to drive this health emergency. Obesity emerges as perhaps the strongest risk factor. Studies consistently show that people with a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; of 30 or higher face nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Diet plays an equally critical role: a Western eating pattern high in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/red-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugar-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt;, and refined grains, while low in fruits and vegetables, has been linked to higher cancer risk. Heavy alcohol use and smoking further compound these effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; represents another major factor largely absent in past generations. This condition, which affects roughly 25% of adults globally and has exploded alongside rising obesity, significantly increases gastrointestinal cancer risk even in people who aren’t severely overweight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unique-challenges-young-cancer-patients-face"&gt;Unique Challenges Young Cancer Patients Face&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond rising numbers, young adults with gastrointestinal cancers encounter challenges that older patients typically avoid. Diagnosis often comes later because neither patients nor doctors initially suspect cancer in someone so young. This delay frequently means the disease has progressed to more advanced stages by the time it’s detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-cancer-psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/a&gt; tend to receive more aggressive treatment than their older counterparts, even though research suggests this intensive approach doesn’t necessarily improve survival outcomes. Studies show that those under 50 are significantly more likely to receive chemotherapy and radiation, but show only marginal survival improvements compared to older patients receiving less intensive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial devastation often follows diagnosis. Researchers have documented that younger cancer patients experience what they term “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/financial-toxicity-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial toxicity&lt;/a&gt;” at much higher rates than older patients. This stems partly from being in peak earning years while facing massive medical bills, and partly from having young families to support during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quality of life impacts can be particularly severe for younger patients. Treatments like pelvic radiation for rectal cancer can affect fertility, sexual function, and bowel control. These concerns are especially relevant for people who may have decades of life ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer disparities along racial and ethnic lines are stark and getting worse. Analysis of California cancer registry data showed that Black Americans had an early-onset colorectal cancer rate of 12.2 per 100,000 compared to 9.2 per 100,000 for White Americans. Five-year survival rates range from 57.6% for Black patients to 69.1% for non-Hispanic White patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-healthcare-is-responding-to-rising-cancer-rates"&gt;How Healthcare Is Responding to Rising Cancer Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare systems are racing to adapt to this new reality. In 2021, the United States lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45, but many experts worry this reactive approach isn’t sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between young and older patients, despite growing evidence that early-onset cancers may behave differently at the molecular level. Young patients often have more aggressive disease features and different genetic profiles, yet they receive essentially the same treatment protocols developed primarily based on studies of older patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some promising developments offer hope. Recent clinical trials have shown that certain intensive treatments may be safely scaled back without compromising outcomes. This is particularly important for younger patients facing decades of potential treatment-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research efforts are now focusing intensively on understanding why certain birth cohorts face higher risks and identifying critical windows during childhood or adolescence when environmental exposures have the most lasting impact. Scientists are also working to develop prevention strategies and screening methods tailored specifically for younger populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these medical advances won’t address the root causes driving this epidemic. As long as obesity rates continue climbing, diets remain dominated by processed foods, and sedentary lifestyles persist, the cancer rates documented in this review are likely to worsen rather than improve. Without dramatic changes to the environmental factors driving these increases, an entire generation faces rectal and other gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer risks&lt;/a&gt; that previous generations never had to confront.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article summarizes a narrative review of existing studies and registry data; it does not constitute medical advice. Readers should consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance on cancer risk and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study represents a narrative review rather than original research with participants. The authors systematically analyzed existing research literature, cancer databases, and registry data to examine trends in early-onset gastrointestinal cancers, defined as those diagnosed before age 50. They reviewed epidemiological data from multiple sources including the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, various national cancer registries, and published studies from around the world. The review focused on colorectal, esophageal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers, examining patterns in incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, genetic features, and treatment outcomes. Rather than conducting new experiments, the researchers synthesized findings from hundreds of existing studies to provide a complete overview of this emerging health issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review documented consistent increases in early-onset gastrointestinal cancer rates globally, with the United States seeing a 14.8% increase between 2010 and 2019. The most striking finding was a birth cohort effect, where Americans born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950. While 10–25% of early-onset cases involve inherited genetic mutations, the majority are sporadic and linked to environmental factors including obesity, Western dietary patterns, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The increases disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations, with significant racial disparities in both incidence and survival rates. Younger patients typically present with more advanced disease stages and receive more intensive treatment than older patients, though survival outcomes vary across different studies and cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a narrative review synthesizing existing literature rather than conducting original research, this paper’s limitations stem from the quality and scope of the studies it analyzed. The authors noted that different studies use varying definitions of “early-onset” cancer, ranging from under 40 to under 60 years old, making direct comparisons challenging. Some cancer registries don’t consistently distinguish between different tumor subtypes, which can affect trend analyses. The review also acknowledged that deeper genomic characterization through whole exome or genome sequencing of large patient cohorts is needed to better understand the molecular differences between early-onset and average-onset cancers. Additionally, many of the risk factor associations come from observational studies rather than controlled trials, limiting the ability to establish definitive causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s easy to grab when running out the door (late for something yet again), sweet enough to feel like a treat, and work well in recipes from smoothies to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60100613/super-moist-banana-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana bread&lt;/a&gt;. So when my editor asked me to eat a banana every day for a week and document how it made me feel, I was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I know the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So if anything, I figured taking on this challenge would help me get closer to eating enough fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened when I ate a banana every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of this experiment, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks to not needing refrigeration. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it on hand when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICELANDIC-PROVISIONS-Caramel-Banana-Creamy/dp/B0D9PC6JVW/ref=sr_1_1_f3_0o_wf?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65545332%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr&lt;/a&gt; (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime (with a glass of milk, of course!). It was very little effort to add a banana to my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of eating bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas might seem basic, but they’re nutritional powerhouses. Here are some of the scientifically backed benefits of eating bananas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains potassium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is a critical nutrient that &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supports heart health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:375 milligrams of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;375 milligrams of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aids digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 grams of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 grams of fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11167165/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;source of prebiotic fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good source of vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One medium banana contains about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64819302/vitamin-b6-vs-b12/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt; are vast, but it particularly helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provides energy boost without the crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27 grams per medium banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 27 grams per medium banana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas contain several antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10465879/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including vitamin C&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banana nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in &lt;a href="https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/resources/nutrition-education-materials/seasonal-produce-guide/bananas#:~:text=Serving%20Size%3A%201%20medium%20banana,105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium banana:;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one medium banana:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates: 27 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugars: 14 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperkalemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hyperkalemia&lt;/a&gt;) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to increase your banana intake, there are plenty of easy (and delicious) ways to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desserts&lt;/strong&gt;: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking&lt;/strong&gt;: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toppings&lt;/strong&gt;: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1La1FKeEo0Q0pGUDRqZ3lnZS16eEVHMXlQNjNVOWJlZHZQTG5QU1RCZjZOZ191QXlMZC1GR05vQ0FQMlNVVlMyOFFBc3hnXzBFMU42ZEtOeUU3MjJkQkZldllsSUlPTVRCbUNLSQ</guid></item><item><title>研究癌症30年的研究人员分享了6个简单的技巧来扭转它-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwJBVV95cUxNNDBPb0tNTWN1dE56MHV6dkxRa1BldVdzdS05d2xxZWtwbDRBY1BwM2V1dVpLQkJZODk0dkZSM2tZNnlqaTg3eGVGTk4tbGR4dGhDVmkzbm1XSTZOeU5USXZXYmw2end1ajJDVEdSUnhNMmNoUncyVE5ia0dFY2NhaTU0NnBVNWEwYUEtakYzRDA2UDRPanhJdW9SblNCMDlDV2R1a2duVW1qeU5kZEg3a2VyWG9CelI5YzNUUU9RVG9fMGRQWVZXbGQ0ZkhySy16bjVudHNwQTFhMUhPWnF5UmhQUm00WGRnQll4bVRVNlBIUFIyVG5jRWdrR0cxRzlmbV9TY0Yzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation fuels cancer and damages the body’s repair systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inflammation is supposed to help the body heal.

                &lt;p&gt;As an obesity doctor, a nutrition researcher, and a professor of medicine and aging, Kurt Hong has dedicated his life to understanding the link between our &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diets and longevity&lt;/a&gt; and helping patients avoid diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his career isn't entirely selfless, he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always joke with my wife that I also do this for selfish reasons," Hong said, "I'm always looking for ways to stay young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the 52-year-old father of three, age is just a number thanks to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oral-microbiome-clean-teeth-live-longer-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lifestyle choices &lt;/a&gt;we can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old," he said.

            &lt;p&gt;"The other part of it is that by getting your fruits and vegetables, you also get a lot of the vitamins," Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of evidence suggests that people who eat more plants are likely to be healthier than those who don't. In a 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which followed more than 12,000 people for 29 years, those who reported eating about four to five servings of plants a day, and little to no processed or red meat, were 18 to 25% less likely to die prematurely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;than those who relied more on meat and other animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5" data-toc-id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5"&gt;Eat a lot of fish&lt;/h2&gt;

But while proper hydration is important for your health and avoiding heat-related illness, doctors say that going about it the wrong way could mess with your stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Issues specifically show up in the form of acid reflux, aka gastroesophageal reflux. It seems weird, but drinking too much water or having water at certain times of day raises the risk of uncomfortable reflux symptoms, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ashkan Farhadi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason behind this is a little complicated and taps into body mechanics. But if you’re prone to reflux, it’s important to be aware that your summer hydration habits could be making things worse. With that in mind, we tapped four gastroenterologists to explain how water can exacerbate symptoms of reflux, plus how to stay well hydrated without raising the risk of symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it’s important to understand why reflux happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition that happens when contents of your stomach come back up into your esophagus, the long tube that connects your throat to your stomach, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(NIDDK). Many people experience this once in a while, and you can even have reflux without noticing any symptoms. People who do have symptoms may experience heartburn, regurgitation, nausea, pain while swallowing, a chronic cough or hoarseness, per the NIDDK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux usually happens when the lower esophageal sphincter, which serves as a lid that keeps stomach acid and other contents from flowing back into the esophagus, becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn’t, Farhadi explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking too much water can exacerbate acid reflux symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to guzzle a bunch of water at once in the summer, but pacing yourself may be easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking large amounts of water can increase the volume of the stomach,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rishi Naik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Rishi Naik&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “When the volume of the stomach increases, it increases pressure, which then leads to upward pressure through your lower esophageal sphincter.” That can increase reflux, causing uncomfortable symptoms in the process, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Guido Mieth via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Guido Mieth via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Pacing your water intake can be easier on your stomach, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This esophageal sphincter acts like a valve to protect your esophagus from reflux but, when there is too much pressure, this can lead to backup through the valve into the esophagus which can worsen acid reflux symptoms,” Naik said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Water isn’t acidic, pointed out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

But those with acid reflux are in trouble,” Farhadi said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing matters, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While flooding your stomach with a lot of water at once raises the risk of reflux, so does drinking a lot of water after a meal, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ellen Stein" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ellen Stein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can easily overwhelm the stomach size and this can cause a rise in the fluid level that can produce more reflux symptoms,” she said. “It’s the same as over-eating or overfilling your stomach.

Her advice: Drink when you feel thirsty, and try to have a steady amount of water throughout the day vs. downing a lot at once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I usually remind people to drink a little when they wake up, have a little with breakfast, have a mid-morning sip, sip something with lunch, something in the afternoon, something with dinner, and something in the early evening,” she said. (You can keep an eye on your urine color to see if you’re well-hydrated: It should be clear to pale yellow.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Kahn, now 33, noticed a few bats flying around but didn’t worry about them — until one flew up to her and got tangled between her camera and her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKMNUD4HD5GNJI5ZQ5XTON4MME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She screamed, and part of the bat went into her mouth. She doesn’t know which part or for how long, though she estimates it was for only a few seconds. “It seemed longer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJLXANC3WBBSHCE6ZI5BRRNY5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The bat flew away, leaving Kahn shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALEJDVW7RZGE5MN6XWLEDCU6MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She didn’t think the animal had bitten her. Regardless, her father, who is a physician and was traveling with her, said she should go to a hospital within a day or so and begin &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2021/09/29/illinois-rabies-bat/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinations against rabies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYNKLD4L6RCMFMDBE7QK5V4GPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Figuring she would be covered as long as she obtained insurance before going to the hospital, Kahn said, she found a policy online the day after the bat incident. She said she called the company before she bought its policy and was told that services related to an accident or “life-threatening” emergency would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7XNPVV723JDEXDU552QSADZ4KE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn went the next day to a hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she started rabies prevention treatment. Over the next two weeks, she received the rest of the rabies shots at clinics in Arizona and Massachusetts and at a hospital in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WTN3BXQCRRDCDI5R4KON4CJM3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn received a total of four doses of the rabies vaccine.

Experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommend precautionary measures&lt;/a&gt; when a person has been potentially exposed to rabies, because once the neurological disease causes symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;it is fatal&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says postexposure rabies treatment has reduced the number of human fatalities to fewer than 10 per year in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZI7JDIKTZGIBHEJNME6VZG364" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to explanation-of-benefits statements, Kahn owed a total of $20,749 for her care at the four facilities. Most of the charges were from the hospital where she was first treated, Flagstaff Medical Center: $17,079, including $15,242 for the rabies and immunoglobulin shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="I6EVS3MAMBEBHGCTXBP7ZXE244" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="I6EVS3MAMBEBHGCTXBP7ZXE244" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The billing problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VLQVCFEDX5BAVFJU63LBL4FK54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn’s policy did not pay for any of the services. “The required waiting period for this service has not been met,” said an explanation-of-benefits letter she received in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YADQ5ILIFGP5KKWMKODOYYIDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn was stunned. “I thought it must have been a mistake,” she said. “I guess I was naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WRS3GFIOOVB2NI7GM4JMXLXOMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kahn was laid off from her job as a biomedical engineer last summer, she had the option to temporarily stay on her former employer’s insurance under a COBRA plan, at a cost of about $650 per month. But as a young, healthy person, she gambled that she could get by without insurance until she found another job. She figured that if she needed medical care, she could quickly buy a private policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJODOWLT3FCTZNMVZPJCUDNCL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, those who qualify for COBRA must be given &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/cobra_qna" target="_blank"&gt;at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt; to sign up — and if they do, the coverage applies retroactively. Kahn, who was still within that period at the time of the incident, said recently that she did not realize she had that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="55UT7MC56NDHJD4AUJNXTKJHMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The policy she purchased after the bat episode, which cost about $311 a month, was from a Florida company called Innovative Partners LP. Documents Kahn provided to KFF Health News say the policy has a 30-day waiting period, which “does not apply to benefits regarding an accident or loss of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSRHIY3TUNCW5LHWJ6ESAUMRRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn said that after receiving notice that her claims were denied, she called the company to ask how she could appeal and was told that a doctor would have to file paperwork. She said she wrote a letter that was signed by a doctor at Flagstaff Medical Center and submitted it in March but was unable to reach doctors at the other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PM7PVOU3PFCZJL3T7APWC5ER4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn said she was given conflicting answers about where to send the paperwork.

But that doesn’t mean they have to pay for treatment of an injury sustained shortly before a person enrolls in coverage, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCXZCY4BFNGI3ACJU3BF3U45CQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Corlette, who reviewed a brief benefits overview provided by Kahn, said the policy appears to have been a limited, &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/aca_implementation_faqs11" target="_blank"&gt;“fixed indemnity” plan&lt;/a&gt;, which would pay only set amounts toward treatments per day or another period regardless of total expenses incurred. Such plans have been around for decades and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/short-term-health-plan-surprise-billing-7k-colonoscopy-bill-of-the-month-march-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;aren’t required to meet&lt;/a&gt; ACA standards, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4N5IQO27REWVNES4N6YP3PWCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But she said even if Kahn had bought comprehensive health insurance, it probably wouldn’t have covered treatment received so soon after she had purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDV7B7O7WZDCPM5YMCLDI52R3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David Shlim, a travel medicine specialist in Wyoming who studies rabies, said Kahn made the right choice by promptly seeking treatment, even though she didn’t feel the bat bite her. The disease is deadly, and the fact that the bat went into her mouth meant she could have been infected from its saliva, he said: “You could hardly have a more direct exposure than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CZ5FJ4XTXRGPXHCQTMJLIWMRIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shlim, who recently co-wrote &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-associated-infections-diseases/rabies.html" target="_blank"&gt;a federal advisory about rabies prevention&lt;/a&gt;, added that healthy bats don’t normally fly into people, as the one in this case did.

No gym membership required. Just a pair of shoes and a willingness to alternate between brisk and slow-paced walking in three-minute bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Japanese walking,” the latest viral fitness trend is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/japanese-walking?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and has people wondering whether this short-interval workout can improve health more efficiently than a traditional stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend has spread across social media and beyond, with bloggers, online articles and major media outlets all jumping in on the walking routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol traces back to a&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank"&gt; 2007 Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; that tested the effects of high-intensity interval walking on middle-aged and older adults. But the recent buzz started with a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@coacheugeneteo/video/7509367099370802448" target="_blank"&gt;punchy video&lt;/a&gt; from Australian content creator and fitness coach Eugene Teo that surpassed 10 million views on TikTok and 17 million views on YouTube. Known to his over 426,000 TikTok followers and 1.22 million YouTube followers as “Coach Eugene,” Teo rebranded the science-backed routine into an accessible, algorithm-friendly idea: “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t like fitness jargon,” Teo, 33, said in a recent interview with The Times. “They don’t like scientific terms … and if I want to impact millions globally ... I like to make fitness advice and scientific jargon a lot more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his video explainer, Teo describes the method: Walk fast for three minutes, slow down for three minutes and repeat the cycle five times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the small study of 186 women and 60 men, participants who followed this routine four or more days a week saw greater improvements in blood pressure, leg strength and aerobic capacity than those in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s that cardio work that a lot of people are missing,” Teo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo, a longtime coach and nutritionist, didn’t invent the protocol, but he did help it reach millions. He said his viral video resonated with people overwhelmed by the pressure to hit 10,000 steps a day — a goal Teo himself often finds out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s been following this protocol on and off for years, ever since he came across the study. Usually, he does his walking on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people have this all-or-nothing approach where they think, ‘Oh, I can’t hit 10,000 steps. I’ve failed,’” he said. “It’s about just changing the stigma people have and that all-or-nothing mentality ... of what fitness should be about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes effort over perfection: Walk fast enough to get out of breath, but not so fast that you can’t finish the three-minute interval. The recovery periods are as slow as needed to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is the science behind the trend as strong as the messaging? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Helga Van Herle, a cardiologist with Keck Medicine of USC, noted flaws in the original study’s design — namely, that only the high-intensity walking group was monitored with accelerometers, not the moderate intensity group, a bias that could have skewed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This creates a major bias in the monitoring and compliance and could potentially skew the results in favor of the high-intensity training group,” she said in an email, pointing to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/09.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Hawthorne effect&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon in which people alter their behavior because they know they’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg, also with Keck Medicine of USC, said he doesn’t see intense interval walking as a standout recommendation among physicians. The study, he said, was small and meant to be thought-provoking and encourage further research, not to support sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He supports any activity that gets people moving but cautions against over-hyping Japanese walking benefits or ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of onerous,” he said, explaining that remembering to switch gears every three minutes, walking fast and slow and navigating technology isn’t easy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it’s possible to get similar benefits by walking continuously at a vigorous pace for a shorter time. But there isn’t enough evidence to confirm that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that vigorous activity, even in short spurts, is beneficial. David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC, said short intervals of increased effort — even just walking briskly for a few minutes — can yield meaningful health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc16566/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/320x214!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bca416d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/568x380!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24ca0e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/768x514!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60e4d63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1024x685!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8eebac6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt='A graphic of data related to “Japanese walking."' srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e0c8e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28c8f44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/568x380!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3bf8665/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/768x514!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3af7eac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1024x685!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7d87ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7d87ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Searches for “Japanese walking” have increased over the past year, particularly since April.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Google Trends)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something to the idea that small amounts of vigorous activity are really beneficial,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raichlen also noted that calling high-intensity interval walking “Japanese walking” simply because of the study’s origin is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuyuki Suzuki, a cardiac imaging specialist from Tokyo, is aware of the trend and the associated study. He said that while there is some new interest in the topic, it is not trending in Japan the way it appears to be in other parts of the world. He also said he does not feel any discomfort or concern about it being referred to as “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether this method is better than 10,000 steps or continuous walking, Raichlen is hesitant to say — the research just isn’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher walking cadence has been linked to lower dementia risk, Raichlen said. Also, walking in general has been tied to lower mortality, reduced cancer risk and improved cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think there’s a lot of good from encouraging people to think about walking as exercise,” Raichlen said. “Finding ways to sort of make walking work better for you is, you know, not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the simplicity and catchy name may be why it took off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much anybody in Los Angeles can go outside and walk around,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a UCLA associate professor and internet culture expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts sees the trend as a reflection of broader social forces, including medical mistrust and the rising cost of health care and fitness. “We’re in a moment of economic uncertainty,” she said. “For most people, a $300-a-month membership at Equinox is not a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, she said, makes low-barrier trends like “Japanese walking” especially appealing. But Roberts cautioned against the risks of turning to TikTok and other social media platforms for medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she said. “There’s a bigger social and political context to all of these things, and the backdrop to these kinds of trends is not great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts encourages viewers to critically evaluate where their health advice comes from and who profits from it. “People with big followings often have something to sell,” she said. “They’re not really acting in the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Roberts said, with every health trend, social media companies are profiting. Although some platforms have tried to crack down on medical misinformation, Roberts said such content moderation has fallen out of favor because it affects revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Devaluing expertise means devaluing the collective knowledge that people have in certain domains,” Roberts said. “If I try to fix my own car, my car is probably not going to run very well. Now apply that to my body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo said fitness trends should be approached with discernment. He’s not claiming to replace traditional walking — just to offer a stepping stone for cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a viral name is what it takes to get people walking, he’s OK with that. “As long as you’re not misleading people,” he said, “and there’s legitimate substance behind it, it’s a great way to spin things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo, Raichlen, Garg and Roberts all agree on one thing: Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially one that reaches vigorous intensity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSFNjQ0dyMElqLWRBRFBSZlVTZXAwcld5OUp5Y05BNC1XLUx1b1Bhc3lvZ1dwRVd3d0JNOUprcXBxVG51QU1qcnBKeWktdjYwVFNEYmd1YWdfN1pNSHRPU2F3RFl6SlFuNW56NUFxVlpqSm5lbU1KU0hyVUVJVS1wcGhqQXJnQmlXTFE</guid></item><item><title>慢性病？在肯尼迪看来，这可能是你自己的错- KFF健康新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPOGQ4WjBDTnA3LXpma1pMaFVpSVFMWHZPVExBOFIzTExjSFZNcG9EWTFieEZhT3JOQm94OVhJY3RZMGlMS1pCRXljcFpqSEl4Yk5JOVFuQnVULTBLMmZWWTc0SUVpNnFpMFpiODFNOFdGczhLV0RXeVlKZmoyanI3RWFlU0N6aEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;On a recent weekday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashly-richards-1610aa44/"&gt;Ashly Richards&lt;/a&gt; helped her 13-year-old son, Case, with homework. He did math problems and some reading, underscoring how much he’s accomplished at his school for children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Richards has heard Trump administration officials suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeIZkacWkk"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;pediatric vaccines&lt;/a&gt; cause autism and ADHD. That stance, she said, unfairly blames parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence to support it,” said Richards, 44, a marketing director in Richmond, Virginia. “As a parent, it’s infuriating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their zeal to “Make America Healthy Again,” Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues — such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity — to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said at a news conference on April 16 that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/apr/24/RFK-jr-environmental-toxins-causing-autism/"&gt;autism is preventable&lt;/a&gt; and that rates are rising because of toxic substances in the environment, despite a lack of evidence there is any link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date,” he said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to covid vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,” said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s these two extreme views. It’s every health decision is up to the ‘rugged individual,’ versus the other extreme view that it’s all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it’s on a continuum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blame Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in late May that it would be effective to “treat more diabetes with cooking classes” instead of “just throwing insulin at people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don’t produce it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20type%201,another%20option%20for%20some%20people."&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes “need to take diabetes medicines as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that’s a “disrespect of life” for short-term gain and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are prescribing them like candy,” she said last year on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;The Tucker Carlson Show&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that birth control medications “are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have a child on ADHD meds? &lt;a href="https://calleymeans.com/"&gt;Calley Means&lt;/a&gt;, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means’ brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they’re in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a society, he said, “we’re really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we’re normalizing that and we’re not speaking out about that. And then we’re giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a &lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html"&gt;methamphetamine-based&lt;/a&gt; drug administered to Adolf Hitler’s forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/how-do-adderall-and-meth-methamphetamine-differ#differences"&gt;not the same&lt;/a&gt; as methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to messages seeking comment from Means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it’s harder to get outside and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.uschamberfoundation.org/surgeongeneral/680209"&gt;Jerome Adams&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by “the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the Biden administration proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-medicare-advantage-and-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug"&gt;a rule&lt;/a&gt; in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very dark,” Calley Means &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;told Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the weight loss drugs. “I think it’s a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Where is the urgency on saying ‘Hey parents, maybe we shouldn’t feed our kids toxic food?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBWPFf4PmFV/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that drugmakers “are counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,” said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. “It sends the message that it’s your fault. It’s very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren’t individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and HHS didn’t return messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/zepbound-explained-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-fda-approval#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approval%20of%20Zepbound,25%25%20of%20their%20body%20weight."&gt;highest dose of Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many covid-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed covid risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said that people who died from covid actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s really what killed them,” Kennedy said on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;Dr. Phil Primetime&lt;/a&gt;” in April. “These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and covid came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid was the underlying cause of death for more than &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800816"&gt;940,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from covid compared with older children, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;Vaccination during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can help protect infants after birth,” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don’t work and thereby drain resources from the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of “all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they’re going to now have to go get a job,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61569"&gt;the Congressional Budget Office estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update/"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,” said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: “We’re going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don’t get it, it’s your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;

staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;CasyD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes moms so protective of their children, according to science?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mothers will go to great lengths to shield their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-parenthood-memes-pregnantchicken/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; from harm. Maybe not quite as dramatically as the mom in this story, but research does show that mothers tend to be more preoccupied with their kids’ safety than fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/gender-and-parenting/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey revealed that 51% of mothers describe themselves as overprotective compared to 38% of fathers. Moms also report being more anxious about their children facing tough challenges in life, whether that’s dealing with depression, bullying, or physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/03/mothers-have-higher-fear-and-anxiety-than-fathers-what-does-it-mean-for-brands/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 89% of mothers worry about the overall safety of the world their children live in, compared to 66% of fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do moms feel such an intense drive to protect their children? Is it purely maternal instinct, the physical bond from &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lesser-known-things-pregnancy-child-birth/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and birth, or the societal expectations placed on mothers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While experts continue to debate the causes, one intriguing study published in &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24080" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt; dug deeper into the biology behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance/?image_id=sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Shop Owner Says If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News, So This Mom Did Exactly That" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance/?media_id=sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9107264" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg" alt='Shop Owner Says "If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News", So This Mom Did Exactly That' title='Shop Owner Says "If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News", So This Mom Did Exactly That' loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://elements.envato.com/mother-and-son-LWDSWM6" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;svetlanas13/Envato (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to understand why many animals react to threats against their young by freezing or fleeing, whereas humans often leap to defend their children, even at great personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, they found, lies in a chemical in the brain called oxytocin, often referred to as the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;“love hormone.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released through touch, bringing those warm, fuzzy feelings you get when hugging, cuddling, or kissing someone you care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During childbirth, it floods the body, driving uterine contractions and later helping the uterus expel the placenta, reducing the risk of postpartum complications. It also calms stress, eases pain during labor, and strengthens the emotional bond between a mother and her newborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oxytocin is a powerful attachment chemical that drives maternal instinct,” biological anthropologist Helen Fisher (who was not involved in the study) told &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/science-says-love-hormone-drives-mothers-protect-kids-221035596.html" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since oxytocin in the amygdala, the brain’s emotional processing center, prevents animals from freezing in dangerous situations, the eLife researchers decided to test its effects on mother rats who had just given birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trained the rats to associate the smell of peppermint with danger by pairing it with a mild electric shock. Despite the unpleasant setup, the results were telling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When oxytocin levels were high, the mother rats actively protected their pups from the danger signal. Some attacked the peppermint-scented tube, while others focused on nursing and keeping their babies close. But when oxytocin was blocked, the mothers froze and left their young to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The babies learned from this behavior, too. Pups whose mothers comforted them recognized peppermint as a threat, while those without that comfort never developed the same sense of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while rallying a news crew to shut down a shop selling weapons to kids isn’t quite the same scenario, it proves something timeless: a mother’s love is its own unstoppable force of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watch the footage below&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozXJiO_ZGq0?si=6I-91FUIJcwD5cXI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozXJiO_ZGq0" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Howdy Print&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The author revealed that his mother has since passed, but remained every bit as fierce until the very end&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers were in awe of her determination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_5" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_6" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_7" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_8" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_9" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_10" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_11" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9102467" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9102467" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="15012"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9102467-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

The clip shows how this canine’s food preferences changed after the owner’s vegan brother dropped by. His “zesty appetite” left the pet parent surprised. Netizens also couldn’t hold back their laughter, with the video fetching more than 8K likes from viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever sourcing food from nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s a rare sight for pet parents to see their furbabies happily sourcing food from nature. Pets usually depend on their humans for their meals. However, it seems this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, Huxley, has taken matters into his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pup’s owner came home to Huxley being a pro at snacking right from the garden without anyone’s help. The dog mom captured her Golden Retriever’s new avatar and shared it on @hugoandursula to show the world his new eating habit, courtesy of her “vegan hippy brother from Berlin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip shows how the Golden, without any hesitation, jumps to the shrubs or bushes to pick the ripe fruits and berries for his snack time. In the time his mom was away from home, the canine has upped his foraging skills, clearly becoming a pro at it. Moreover, the pup seems very excited and proud while plucking stuff from the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This change in Huxley’s diet even left the dog mom amazed. It was a new habit that he developed in her absence, all thanks to her brother, who visited the furbabies to care for them. She even mentioned the diet change in the video’s caption, saying that her “younger brother very kindly came and looked after the boys whilst I was away.. anyways I’ve noticed a couple of changes since I’ve been back, mainly Huxley’s zesty appetite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video of the Golden Retriever and his new diet left netizens in splits. They immediately took this opportunity to share their stories. One dog owner wrote, “My Goldies used to eat the apples from the trees in my  garden .. always foraging.” While another pet parent commented, “Garden snackies are the best snackies. My pear tree isn’t safe from ferocious pupper munching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/184782-golden-retriever-diet-food-vegan-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever’s Diet Dramatically Changes After Owner’s Vegan Brother’s Visit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever’s Diet Dramatically Changes After Owner’s Vegan Brother’s Visit&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 07:49:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQWWNJU2JmbHNrMWxEQjJnbVJtV2dVdGcwZ3RFdkZSUTNfLXFrWlhnSkRFQ1hCNmFJUjVRcmJKZjZKaHRtM29HZ3oyaVNpVFNFNGQ3NTd3MVhHano3dndrYXFHZUFUWXNNbGxwdER4TnJLV1RPakYwYjhhVEtSUnVQSGd6Y1owUUFFSXVCbzNCT3JXU2tSR2YzNlgzLVk</guid></item><item><title>纽约市军团病集群造成1人死亡，至少22人患病- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNGxUTHRQa0RsOXZBOW9ZbERFdlVLMkxaLUpJOUpNLS1mcXpMdU9qT1c5cTN2a3J5V0Q5TG5kQTZiRFA2RTd1UmZMZWxDT3Y3TDJSUFFOaGl1Rm1nSW54V21FQ0drU0tNUW8wOGREMnJ4bWxBclpaVmFZRUZJRURwNWVHekQ5QmthSEhYblh5UDVxci16aW0xbjU5YmzSAaIBQVVfeXFMT1VHSl83NzVSUWVwb3JSLS1fWnR4QXZJdlFtV2hUaDhhMHM3RVRaXzZKNkRwLTFyWW5hQUx2MHZRSFZFeGFBZ0dkWXRrb0dOeDhzLXdHaHRjN2pHbktRM2VUQ0JiclJ4Q2NFaFVVSjN5ZFBWS0VWZWh0VW11ZG5aNFAtbm01MkFqRC1CVEM5RDF5MHFUZnBISGhvbDg5RldzVmtR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;One person is dead and at least 22 people have become sick from a Legionnaires’ disease cluster in &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/new-york" id="_ap_link_New York City_NewYork_" target="_blank"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; since last Friday, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The New York City Health Department provided an update on Thursday into its investigation of a community cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City and the surrounding communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“People who have been in the affected area since late July with flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention,” the New York City Health Department said Wednesday. “People living or working in the area with flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, chills, muscle aches, or difficulty breathing should contact a health care provider immediately.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A filling breakfast with protein, fats and fiber helped reduce my constant snacking urges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs and avocado offer lasting energy and brain-boosting nutrients to start the day strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 15-minute cheesy egg quesadilla became my go-to meal for staying full and focused all morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love snack time! I love it so much that I found myself caught in a cycle of constant grazing between meals. The temptation of the snack drawer, which is conveniently located just a few steps away from my workspace, proved to be a real challenge for me. It seemed like every moment of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7821944/5-tips-to-help-if-youre-eating-out-of-stress-or-boredom/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress or boredom&lt;/a&gt; was an excuse to reach for a snack. The result? Over-snacking, which led to energy spikes followed by inevitable crashes and a constant feeling of guilt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One day, as I sat there contemplating grabbing another snack, I decided it was time for a change. Even as a registered dietitian nutritionist, I still experience challenges from time to time, which serves as a reminder that we’re all human and deserve grace and compassion. To help get my snacking under control, I started by taking a closer look at my meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’ve always made it a priority to choose a variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt;, but I realized I was falling short at breakfast. Mornings at my house tend to be rushed, but I knew if I made sure to include key nutrients, such as fiber, healthy fats and protein, I would feel fuller longer and curb my morning snack attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of my favorite go-to breakfasts became this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944807/cheesy-egg-quesadilla-with-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cheesy Egg Quesadilla with Spinach&lt;/a&gt;. This recipe comes together in 15 minutes, which fits in perfectly with my busy lifestyle. Besides being extremely delicious and convenient, it’s made with satisfying ingredients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Packed with high-quality protein, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8047370/dietitian-favorite-high-protein-breakfast-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs provide a sustained source of energy&lt;/a&gt; that keeps me feeling full and satisfied. They also contain essential nutrients including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-b12-benefits-8676211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; and choline, both of which support brain health. To elevate the nutritional profile of these tasty quesadillas, slices of avocado are added on top. Rich in good fats and fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; help to increase satiety, while adding a creamy element to the meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best things about this quesadilla recipe is its versatility. It’s the perfect canvas for a variety of vibrant veggies, sauces and herbs—allowing you to customize your quesadilla to suit any palate or dietary preference, or to use up anything in your fridge. If you find yourself with a little more time, sauté some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bell-pepper-recipes-to-make-forever-8610625" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bell peppers&lt;/a&gt; or spinach, or chop some fresh tomatoes to sprinkle on top. And if you enjoy a little spice in your life, a drizzle of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252949/homemade-hot-sauce/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;salsa or hot sauce&lt;/a&gt; adds an additional layer of flavor and excitement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The variety of flavors and textures in this recipe made each bite a delight, and by incorporating a mix of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein, healthy fats and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to provide my body with a sustained source of energy needed to conquer the day. Fueling my body with this nourishing breakfast also provided me with mental clarity, improved focus and, of course, fewer trips to the snack drawer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The continuous need to snack disappeared and was replaced by a sense of empowerment and better control over my eating habits. That simple shift of making a more satiating and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8047370/dietitian-favorite-high-protein-breakfast-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutritionally dense breakfast&lt;/a&gt; not only fostered a sense of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; but has also positively impacted my overall health. The snack drawer may still be there, but it’s no longer my nemesis; instead it serves as a stepping-stone toward a more mindful relationship with food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a balanced, nutrient-rich breakfast can make a major difference in how you feel and eat for the rest of the day. By prioritizing protein, healthy fats and fiber first thing in the morning, you’ll feel fuller longer, experience steadier energy levels and curb the urge to mindlessly snack. It’s a practical, sustainable strategy that supports both physical health and a more mindful relationship with food—even for nutrition experts.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, MD, MSCI,&lt;/a&gt; the gastroenterologist who goes by Dr. B, shared a list of five essential things that he does to protect his gut health each day. His list includes some basic dietary tips we can get behind, plus one great suggestion that will help you get a good night's rest. While not every piece of advice will work for every person, these doc-approved habits are a great way to start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-enjoy-your-morning-cup-of-joe"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Enjoy Your Morning Cup of Joe &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Coffee actually has prebiotics in it already, but I actually like to put in a soluble fiber supplement and some spices, really take it up to the next level," Bulsiewicz says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spices can be a great way to add a little anti-inflammatory kick to your cup of coffee, especially since warm-sweet options like cinnamon and clove are among &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the very best spices for reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While we don't always recommend supplements, a soluble fiber supplement can be a resource if you have a hard time getting enough from your diet alone. Research indicates that eating more soluble fiber could be great for your health, from making antibiotics more effective to reducing your dementia risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just keep in mind that you can also get in lots of soluble fiber from whole foods, like oats, legumes and fruit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-eat-fermented-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Eat Fermented Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fermented foods are rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, the beneficial bacteria that can help your gut balance itself out and even support digestion. There are plenty of ways to work this tip into your diet, from kimchi and sauerkraut to yogurt and kombucha. If you don't think of yourself as a person who enjoys the funky tang of condiments like miso or kraut, you could opt for a serving of kefir or mix your favorite fruit with ice and yogurt for a quick smoothie.

Don't Count Calories—But Eat More Plants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Stop counting calories," Bulsiewicz says. "Start counting plants. Enough with the dietary restrictions—let's live a life of abundance with as many different varieties of plants as possible."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We couldn't agree more with this plant-focused advice. There are so many health benefits to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt;, but an eating pattern made up of predominantly plants with occasional servings of meat or animal products can also be beneficial. That kind of plant-focused diet, which is less stringent than a plant-based one, could be especially good for your heart health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes the oldest advice is still the best. Eating lots of different kinds of foods—veggies, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and heart protein—from meal to meal is a great way to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need to thrive as well as delicious, varied meals that won't get you stuck in a dinner rut. (That principle is just part of the reason we love &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; so much.) A mix-and-match option like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290800/the-best-no-recipe-formula-for-making-easy-veggie-packed-sheet-pan-dinners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sheet-pan dinner formula&lt;/a&gt; is a simple way to start mixing up your dinner-time routine, and those recipe ideas will ensure that you at least get some protein and veggies on your plate. You could also lean on easy, pile-it-on bowls to get in all those necessary nutrients. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7960938/salmon-rice-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Salmon Rice Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7965658/vegetarian-protein-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Vegetarian Protein Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7965781/cilantro-lime-shrimp-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cilantro-Lime Shrimp Bowl&lt;/a&gt; are customizable and low-effort, so you can eat diverse foods without adding tons of cooking time to your schedule.

Wear Blue Light-Blocking Glasses Before Bed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might be surprised to see this tip show up on a list focused on healthy eating, but research has shown that your exposure to blue light just before bed can have quite an impact on your health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blue light stimulates your brain—yup, even when you're sleeping—so donning blue light-blocking glasses can help you wind down at the end of the day and get better sleep. If you need helpful lenses before bed to read, keep an eye out for blue light-blocking readers or even splurge for a blue light filter on your next pair of prescription eyeglasses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supporting your gut health doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire routine. Simple, daily habits—like adding more plants to your plate, enjoying fermented foods and limiting nighttime blue light—can go a long way. The key is consistency and variety. Start small, listen to your body and build a gut-friendly lifestyle that works for you.

Analyzing a separate breast cancer database from the United States, including nearly 37,000 patients, they discovered that a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a greater than 40 percent increased risk of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice suggest that viruses might be behind the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt; and SARS-CoV-2 infections triggered dormant breast cancer cells in mice to proliferate after only days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, there was "a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions" by more than 100-fold, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by molecular geneticist Shi Chia from the University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although species differences warrant caution in interpreting mouse data… collectively, these findings underscore the substantial metastatic risk COVID-19 posed to cancer survivors," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169598" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-642x247.png" alt="Dormant Breast Cancer Cells" class="wp-image-169598 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-642x247.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-1024x394.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-768x295.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-600x231.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169598" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Viruses increase IL-6 and contribute to the awakening and expansion of dormant mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells (DCC).

That's why the HPV vaccine has proved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;so life-changing&lt;/a&gt; for millions. It prevents deadly, viral-associated diseases, like cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1936, scientists have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers2020752"&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt; for a virus that triggers breast cancer in a similar way, mostly in mice and human population studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk viruses have been detected in human breast cancer samples. EBV, for instance, is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13027-021-00366-3"&gt;five times higher&lt;/a&gt; in breast cancer tissue than in normal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the idea that viruses may predispose us to cancer is plausible, research in human cells is limited, and the mechanism underlying the disease spread remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system's response to viruses could possibly play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initial remission, a tiny number of breast cancer cells can remain dormant in lung, bone, and liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, inflammation can wake these cancer cells up – and viral respiratory infections, like the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19, can cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current mouse experiments, the influenza A virus only reawakened dormant cancer cells in the lung if they triggered an increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same was true of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the immune system's response to viruses breeds the perfect environment for cancer to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What our data suggest is that if you are a cancer patient who has these dormant cells, you may end up living a normal life and dying with these dormant cells, instead of dying because those dormant cells awakened," &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/cancer-center/covid-19-awaken-dormant-cancer-cells"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; DeGregori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you get a respiratory virus like influenza or COVID, your chance of dying from those dormant cells awakening is much greater."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's true, then it will be vital to protect the millions of breast cancer survivors out there who may face an increased risk of relapse if they get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to see if vaccination against influenza or COVID-19 can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Market Research Future, that number is projected to rise to $2.6billion by 2034.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the number of Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14905141/I-diagnosed-IBS-20-discovered-devastating-truth-decades-later.html"&gt;searching online for information&lt;/a&gt; on hemorrhoids increased five-fold &lt;span&gt;between 2004 and 2023, a DailyMail.com analysis of Google Trends found.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids can be caused by many things, including straining during bowel movements, constipation, heavy lifting, sitting for long periods of time and pregnancy, but experts are increasingly pointing to phone use in the bathroom as a major culprit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This phone use extends the time you are sitting on the toilet, and prolonged sitting leads to &lt;/span&gt;increased pressure on the veins in the anus and lower rectum, which can cause them to swell and become inflamed, causing hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor diet or lack of fiber, which 95 percent of Americans do not get enough of in their diet, may also be contributing, as not enough fiber and dehydration can lead to constipation and straining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The number of people suffering from painful and disruptive hemorrhoids is growing, doctors say, with the modern lifestyle likely to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new survey out of the Beth &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/israel-hamas-conflict/index.html" id="mol-41da98c0-6d58-11f0-a75e-d1b7896cbfdc" class=""&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that people who use their phones on the toilet face a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives, according to The Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include blood in your stool, persistent discomfort, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation when having a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, sufferers may notice a lump in or around the anus, which may be tender or cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rectal prolapse, which occurs when the rectum slips out of its normal position, potentially through the anus, is a condition similar to hemorrhoids and the two can be confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the symptoms are slightly different, with the most common complaints being constipation, itching, pain and bleeding in the rectum and mucus discharge in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases of hemorrhoids can be managed with lifestyle changes, over-the-counter treatments or minor procedures, rectal prolapse typically requires more intensive medical intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In both cases, prevention is far preferable to cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent survey from Beth Israel, presented at the Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) conference in San Diego, considered 125 participants who were receiving a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 40 percent had a hemorrhoid, and 93 percent said they used their phone on the toilet at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half that group said they read news on the toilet, whereas about 44 percent said they were on social media, and about 30 percent were emailing or texting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 66 percent of respondents used smartphones while on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (93 percent) of those used a smartphone on the toilet at least one to two times per week or more, and more than half (55 percent) used it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, exercise activity, and fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who used smartphones on the toilet spent significantly more time there than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a third (37 percent) of them spent more than six minutes per bathroom visit on the toilet compared with seven percent of nonusers, and 35 percent said they believed they spent more time on the toilet because of their smartphone use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2021 study found 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number climbed further when it came to younger people aged 18 to 29, with 93 percent of this age group admitting to using their phones on the toilet, regardless of gender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is no universally agreed 'safe' length of time to spend on the toilet, most gastroenterologists agree that if a bowel movement doesn't happen within five to 10 minutes, it's best to get up, move around and try again later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going for a short walk or gently moving the body can help stimulate bowel motility naturally, without the need to strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors often refer to the Bristol Stool Chart in clinical practice to assess the health of a person's bowel movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietary habits also play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low-fiber diets, dehydration and a sedentary lifestyle can all contribute to constipation and harder stools, which increase the likelihood of straining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend eating more fiber-rich foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans and whole grains, as well as drinking plenty of water throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity, even just light daily movement, can also improve digestion and reduce the chances of constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for technology in the bathroom, Dr Farah Monzur, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Stony Brook Medicine in New York, said keeping phones and reading material out of the bathroom may be one of the simplest and most effective ways to change toilet habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Monzur said that going to the toilet should be treated as a functional event rather than an opportunity to catch up on emails or social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You don't want to go with the mindset that you'll be there for a long time,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because then you'll want to bring something to keep your mind occupied, and that's what encourages this extended sitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Make sitting on the toilet as uninteresting as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-c1c17bb0-6d41-11f0-baa0-ddf392a808dc" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14954695/habit-fueling-surge-hemorrhoids-phone-toilet.html"&gt;

According to Market Research Future, that number is projected to rise to $2.6billion by 2034.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the number of Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14905141/I-diagnosed-IBS-20-discovered-devastating-truth-decades-later.html"&gt;searching online for information&lt;/a&gt; on hemorrhoids increased five-fold &lt;span&gt;between 2004 and 2023, a DailyMail.com analysis of Google Trends found.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids can be caused by many things, including straining during bowel movements, constipation, heavy lifting, sitting for long periods of time and pregnancy, but experts are increasingly pointing to phone use in the bathroom as a major culprit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This phone use extends the time you are sitting on the toilet, and prolonged sitting leads to &lt;/span&gt;increased pressure on the veins in the anus and lower rectum, which can cause them to swell and become inflamed, causing hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor diet or lack of fiber, which 95 percent of Americans do not get enough of in their diet, may also be contributing, as not enough fiber and dehydration can lead to constipation and straining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The number of people suffering from painful and disruptive hemorrhoids is growing, doctors say, with the modern lifestyle likely to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new survey out of the Beth &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/israel-hamas-conflict/index.html" id="mol-41da98c0-6d58-11f0-a75e-d1b7896cbfdc" class=""&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that people who use their phones on the toilet face a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives, according to The Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include blood in your stool, persistent discomfort, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation when having a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, sufferers may notice a lump in or around the anus, which may be tender or cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rectal prolapse, which occurs when the rectum slips out of its normal position, potentially through the anus, is a condition similar to hemorrhoids and the two can be confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the symptoms are slightly different, with the most common complaints being constipation, itching, pain and bleeding in the rectum and mucus discharge in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases of hemorrhoids can be managed with lifestyle changes, over-the-counter treatments or minor procedures, rectal prolapse typically requires more intensive medical intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In both cases, prevention is far preferable to cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent survey from Beth Israel, presented at the Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) conference in San Diego, considered 125 participants who were receiving a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 40 percent had a hemorrhoid, and 93 percent said they used their phone on the toilet at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half that group said they read news on the toilet, whereas about 44 percent said they were on social media, and about 30 percent were emailing or texting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom.

							&lt;p data-start="120" data-end="243"&gt;Let’s be real: aging is inevitable—but looking and feeling vibrant as the years roll by? That’s something we can influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="245" data-end="521"&gt;We all know someone who seems to defy the rules of time. Maybe it’s your friend’s mom who looks like their older sister. Or that skincare YouTuber who’s pushing 50 but could easily pass for 30. While genetics certainly play a role, lifestyle habits often do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="523" data-end="777"&gt;As someone who’s spent countless hours sampling vegan collagen snacks and decoding what kombucha brews say about your gut health, I’ve come to appreciate how much our daily rituals shape how we age—not just inside, but in our skin, our posture, our glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="779" data-end="909"&gt;So if you’re looking to maintain that youthful spark—whether you’re 28 or 58—here are 7 habits it might be time to say goodbye to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="If you want to look and feel younger in 60 days, say goodbye to these 7 habits" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfC9c6cD9hk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="916" data-end="966"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="923" data-end="966"&gt;Neglecting Your Sleep Like It’s a Trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="968" data-end="1020"&gt;Sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a regenerative powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1022" data-end="1213"&gt;Every night you cut short your rest, you’re essentially delaying your body’s natural repair cycle. That means slower collagen production, less skin hydration, and more pronounced fine lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1215" data-end="1381"&gt;I get it—those 2AM deep dives into K-drama fan theories or scrolling through ‘90s shoegaze vinyl on eBay can be irresistible. But your skin (and brain) pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1383" data-end="1641"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1383" data-end="1394"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="1394" data-end="1397"&gt;Commit to 7–9 hours of sleep and protect it like your favorite playlist. Dim the lights an hour before bed. Trade late-night screens for a relaxing wind-down routine—maybe a reishi hot cocoa, a journal entry, or some lo-fi beats and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1648" data-end="1701"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="1655" data-end="1701"&gt;Eating Like You’re Still in Your Dorm Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1703" data-end="1894"&gt;Let’s talk diet. If your daily intake still revolves around processed snacks, sugary drinks, and takeout fries—your skin and organs might be aging faster than your birth certificate suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1896" data-end="2083"&gt;These foods create chronic inflammation, spike insulin, and reduce your body’s natural ability to repair oxidative damage. Translation: more wrinkles, duller skin, and a tired appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2085" data-end="2248"&gt;As someone who’s reviewed more vegan snacks than I can count, I can confirm: there are nutrient-rich options out there that taste amazing and support glowing skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2250" data-end="2512"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2250" data-end="2261"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2261" data-end="2264"&gt;Nourish your body with vibrant whole foods. Think rainbow salads, fermented goodies like kimchi, and omega-rich bites like walnuts and chia seeds. Antioxidants—especially from berries, leafy greens, and green tea—are your best friends in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2519" data-end="2568"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="2526" data-end="2568"&gt;Treating Skincare Like an Afterthought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2570" data-end="2715"&gt;No shame if your routine used to consist of a 3-in-1 body wash. But if you want to look fresh in your 40s and beyond, now’s the time to level up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2717" data-end="2873"&gt;UV exposure, pollution, and stress all speed up skin aging. A minimalist but consistent skincare routine can go a long way in preserving your youthful glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2875" data-end="3097"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2875" data-end="2886"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2886" data-end="2889"&gt;Start with a good cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. (Yes, SPF—even on cloudy days, even if you’re just inside working by a window.) Bonus points for a gentle exfoliant and a serum with vitamin C or niacinamide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3099" data-end="3199"&gt;And no, your skincare doesn’t need to cost as much as a front-row concert ticket—just be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3206" data-end="3258"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3213" data-end="3258"&gt;Dismissing Hydration Like It’s a Buzzword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3260" data-end="3432"&gt;Dehydration isn’t just about feeling thirsty. It’s also about what happens to your skin, organs, and metabolism when you’re not giving your body enough water to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3434" data-end="3517"&gt;Dry, flaky skin? Sunken eyes? Lackluster energy? All signs you might need more H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3519" data-end="3756"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3519" data-end="3530"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3530" data-end="3533"&gt;Start your morning with a tall glass of water (bonus: add lemon and sea salt for electrolytes). Sip throughout the day—not just when you’re parched. Herbal teas and water-rich fruits like cucumbers and watermelon also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3758" data-end="3871"&gt;And maybe, just maybe, trade one of those extra iced lattes for a refreshing green juice or a hibiscus cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3878" data-end="3925"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3885" data-end="3925"&gt;Stressing Like It’s a Badge of Honor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3927" data-end="4186"&gt;We live in a culture that glamorizes the hustle—but chronic stress literally breaks down your body’s youth-preserving mechanisms. It increases cortisol, which accelerates collagen loss, dehydrates the skin, and even shrinks your brain over time (not kidding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4188" data-end="4377"&gt;As someone who’s juggled deadlines, creative blocks, and the chaos of launching a podcast about vegan food trends—I know how tempting it is to normalize the pressure. But peace is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4379" data-end="4630"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4379" data-end="4390"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4390" data-end="4393"&gt;Make space for joy and decompression. Meditate, go for walks, listen to music that fills you up (might I suggest the latest Men I Trust release?), or try journaling. Protect your nervous system like it’s the last kombucha scoby on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4637" data-end="4696"&gt;6. &lt;strong data-start="4644" data-end="4696"&gt;Forgetting to Move Your Body (Beyond the Scroll)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4698" data-end="4919"&gt;Movement isn't just about aesthetics—it’s about circulation, posture, and mood. A sedentary lifestyle slows your metabolism, reduces lymphatic drainage (read: puffiness), and contributes to that sluggish, “older” feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4921" data-end="5035"&gt;You don’t need to become a CrossFit warrior to reap the benefits. Just find movement that sparks something in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5037" data-end="5251"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5037" data-end="5048"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5048" data-end="5051"&gt;Dance. Stretch. Bike to your local farmers market. Take the stairs. Join a beginner K-pop dance class just for the fun of it (yes, you can). The key is to get your blood flowing and your body aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5253" data-end="5352"&gt;When you move regularly, it shows—especially in the bounce in your step and the light in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5359" data-end="5425"&gt;7. &lt;strong data-start="5366" data-end="5425"&gt;Holding On to Negativity Like It’s Your Favorite Hoodie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5427" data-end="5523"&gt;This might sound woo-woo, but hear me out: your mental and emotional state affects how you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5727"&gt;People who hold onto resentment, complain constantly, or stay locked in pessimism often carry it in their face, their energy, and even their body language. It’s like a shadow dulling your natural shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5729" data-end="5829"&gt;Ever notice how people who radiate joy seem to glow, regardless of their age? That’s no coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5831" data-end="6055"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5831" data-end="5842"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5842" data-end="5845"&gt;Practice gratitude—even if it’s just one thing a day. Release what doesn’t serve you. Surround yourself with people who uplift you. Laugh more. Forgive quicker. Let go of the old stories that wrinkle your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6062" data-end="6101"&gt;Final Thoughts: Glow Is a Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6103" data-end="6279"&gt;Staying youthful isn’t about Botox or miracle serums—it’s about the choices we make every day. From what we eat to how we rest to how we treat ourselves when no one’s watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6281" data-end="6442"&gt;I’ll leave you with this: Aging is a privilege. But showing up for yourself in a way that lets you age with vitality and style? That’s a flex worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6444" data-end="6619"&gt;So go ahead—ditch the habits that drag you down. Drink your water, take that dance class, eat your fermented tofu snack, and wear sunscreen like it’s part of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6621" data-end="6653"&gt;Your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitkin County has confirmed a bat that bit a person near the Weller Lake parking lot up Independence Pass has tested positive for rabies — the fourth confirmed county case in the last eight years and the first positive case since 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jill Pisani, who was bitten, is expected to make a full recovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were received on July 22, according to Carlyn Porter, emergency response and epidemiology program administrator for Pitkin County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“This is fairly unusual,” Porter said. “You never know when the positive one might appear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This bat was one of six bats tested for rabies so far this year, and the only one to test positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pisani, longtime local and teacher, saw the bat while walking about a quarter of a mile up the river from the parking lot to a well-known watering hole she’s been visiting since she was little.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was on a rock, and it was right where dogs cross, where kids cross, kind of in the water a little bit,” she said, who was also with a little girl she teaches. “I picked it up with some leaves, and it crawled up my arm and bit me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she was so focused on protecting the bat, kids, and dogs that she didn’t immediately think about rabies. Following the bite, she learned there was another bat not too far away that was dead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is real,” she said. “I think it’s important to get it out there that there could be a bunch of them out there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the bat bit her, Pisani ultimately submitted it to Porter for testing per her doctor-on-call’s recommendation and went to the emergency room, where they treated her with rabies immunoglobulin shots. She is now receiving a followup series of four vaccination shots from Pitkin County Health &amp;amp; Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I grew up here, and I pick up every creature. I’m still learning, always learning,” she said. “I’m just so grateful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bat was tested at the state lab in Cherry Creek in Denver, according to Porter, after being ethically euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Luckily no one else was exposed,” she said. “We’re not super concerned about public exposure risk. We want to encourage people to not touch wildlife … and when you see bats behaving strangely, there may be a reason for that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those with potential or confirmed exposure to a bat or who want to request a rabies risk assessment can contact &lt;a href="mailto:rabies@pitkincounty.com" target="_blank"&gt;rabies@pitkincounty.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon"&gt;&lt;use class="fa-external-link-alt" xlink:href="#fa-external-link-alt"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article-tagline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;				&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom comes with age. But flexibility? It feels like we lose a little limberness every year — and that can come with some (*ahem*) stiff consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that you can’t do the splits or touch your toes like you used to. Having tighter muscles can affect your ability to navigate day-to-day life, something you may have already started to feel if you have a job that requires a lot of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s one easy thing you can do to combat this: stretch your hip flexors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all types of stretches are good for your body, focusing on your hip flexors is especially important to maintain mobility as you get older. Tight hip flexors can cause lower back pain and muscle fatigue and stretching them can improve balance and resolve other issues, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922112/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/fort-myers-fl/About/Staff" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Gavin Hamer&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and the national director of clinical education at &lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Fyzical Therapy &amp;amp; Balance Centers&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost that “stretching will positively affect the joints, ligaments, and muscles around the hip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flexible muscles are less likely to become strained, and mobile joints are kept healthy by improving circulation and lubrication,” Hamer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, flexible hips lead to “greater stride length and more effective reactions to balance challenges,” according to Hamer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do We Lose Flexibility? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;When her balance issues first started, Mary Pat Mirus thought she was just getting old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She struggled to pick up her feet, gripped walls for support and wobbled when she walked her dog, a Mi-Ki named Betty White. After years of doctors’ visits with clean scans and no diagnosis, Mirus, 72, resigned herself to never figuring her condition out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything was an inward look at myself to see what I was doing wrong,” said Mirus, a retired real estate property manager who lives in Park Ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in June, she was diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a neurological condition caused by irregular spinal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirus was identified as a prime candidate for the STRIDE clinical trial  that uses an “eShunt” in NPH patients to circulate spinal pressure more regularly. Mirus was the first patient in Illinois to receive the eShunt, and among only a handful of Americans to get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks after her surgery, Mirus was walking with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a miracle to me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPH affects more than 800,000 adults in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and mainly those older than age 65. Trouble walking, memory issues and urinary incontinence are some of the most common symptoms. The condition is said to mimic dementia or Alzheimer’s, which makes it difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve been yourself all your life and then all of a sudden, because of this condition, you start becoming unreliable in a way,” said Dr. Demetrius Lopes, a neurosurgeon and director of cerebrovascular neurosurgery at Advocate Health. He was the first doctor in the state to perform the procedure. “If you have this one chance that you can get more time being independent, I think that’s what we’re going for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 60 years, the treatment for NPH has been to insert a traditional shunt by drilling a burr hole in the skull and charting a path through the brain to improve pressure and circulation of spinal fluid. With the new procedure, an incision is made near the patient’s hip and the eShunt is inserted through a vein. While both procedures are effective, the eShunt is a much less invasive, and involves minimal recovery time and a smaller risk for complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The STRIDE clinical trial is part of a larger effort to expand neurological care in the Chicago area. Lopes said it could even lead to other minimally invasive treatments for tumors or gene therapy involving spinal fluid, and he hopes the eShunt will become the standard option if the trial is successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most clinical trials, a select number of patients in the STRIDE trial were randomly selected to receive the new eShunt treatment while others receive the traditional shunt. Mirus was selected to receive the treatment. Though the surgery was new and rare, she wasn’t scared. She was willing to try anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re desperate and you see no exit, everything sounds good. Everything sounds perfect,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirus’ surgery was June 24. Two days later, she left the hospital with minimal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into the hospital in a wheelchair,” Mirus said. “I walked out of the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

I can go on a road trip,” Mirus said. “There’s nothing I can think of, anything I can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when Mirus wasn’t improving in physical therapy, she had fallen a few times. She once came to a doctor’s appointment with a bruise on her forehead after falling over while putting Betty White’s water dish down.

&lt;p&gt;New HIV vaccines have shown promise in studies with lab animals and human volunteers, pointing to a potential way of preventing the lifelong viral disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experimental vaccines are built upon mRNA technology and several triggered potent immune responses in these early tests, while also causing few side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists described the new vaccines in a pair of studies published Wednesday (July 30) in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw0721" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw0721" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first study tested&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few vaccines in rabbits and monkeys, and the promising results of that work led to further development of the shots and the subsequent human trial. The trial included over 100 healthy human volunteers and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady6831" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady6831" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tested three vaccines similar to those tested in animals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort "marks significant progress in the global effort to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine that prevents infection," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/19652" target="_blank" data-url="https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/19652" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Seth Cheetham&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Australian mRNA Cancer Vaccine Centre and deputy director of the BASE mRNA manufacturing facility at the University of Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While drugs for HIV treatment and prevention have transformed the lives of people living with HIV, an effective vaccine is still urgently needed," Cheetham, who was not involved in the work, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-an-mrna-vaccine-for-hiv-could-be-effective-and-affordable" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-an-mrna-vaccine-for-hiv-could-be-effective-and-affordable" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Science Media Exchange&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the annual rate of new human immunodeficiency virus (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/hiv-facts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/hiv-facts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HIV&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) infections has fallen significantly, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but, each year, many hundreds of thousands still occur. Globally, an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV in 2024, including about 120,000 children. An HIV vaccine could be transformative if, in just a few doses, it could raise the immune system's ability to block the virus from taking hold in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/nearly-3-million-extra-deaths-by-2030-could-result-from-hiv-funding-cuts-study-suggests" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/nearly-3-million-extra-deaths-by-2030-could-result-from-hiv-funding-cuts-study-suggests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nearly 3 million extra deaths by 2030 could result from HIV funding cuts, study suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, preventive medications for HIV must be taken on an ongoing basis — either &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;daily, every other month or twice yearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can pose a particular challenge in areas with limited health care resources and infrastructure. Many scientists think a vaccine will be the key to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because such a tool could efficiently stymie new infections and curb further spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But crafting an HIV vaccine is very challenging. The virus expertly evades the immune system by donning disguises, and it mutates rapidly, constantly switching up its look. Ideally, HIV vaccines will trigger the production of elusive "broadly neutralizing antibodies" — proteins that target relatively immutable bits of the virus that look similar across many strains and can block infections, thus offering wide-ranging protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are exploring different strategies to trigger that protection. On that front, the researchers behind the new studies turned to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (mRNA), a molecule that serves as instructions for cells to make proteins. They designed their experimental vaccines to carry directions for a complex of proteins found on the surface of HIV. Called the "envelope trimer," this complex enables the virus to grab the surface of human immune cells and invade those cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once injected into the body, the vaccines prompt cells to build one of two versions of the envelope trimer: one that exits the cell and floats away, and another that stays bound to the surface of the cell. The free-floating version has been targeted in prior HIV vaccines studies, but previously hasn't produced adequate neutralizing antibodies, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think this is because, on the surface of a real HIV particle, the base of the trimer is embedded inside the virus and thus hidden from view. They anticipated that the latter version of the trimer — the one that stays stuck to the cell — would trigger better neutralizing responses that take aim at other parts of the complex, rather than the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be the case in both the animal study and the early clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05217641" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05217641" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;For the human trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers recruited 108 healthy people ages 18 to 55, split them into three groups, and gave each group one of three mRNA vaccines. One vaccine encoded a free-floating trimer, while the latter two encoded different bound versions of the structure. Each participant received three doses of their assigned vaccine: one at the initial visit, another two months later, and a final dose six months after the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the animal tests, the bound trimers elicited stronger signs of protection than the free-floating trimer did. The bound-trimer vaccines produced neutralizing antibodies in 80% of those vaccinated, while the free-floating-trimer vaccine triggered the same response in only 4% of the recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/in-a-1st-hiv-vaccine-triggers-rare-and-elusive-antibodies-in-human-patients" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/in-a-1st-hiv-vaccine-triggers-rare-and-elusive-antibodies-in-human-patients"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, HIV vaccine triggers rare and elusive antibodies in humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bound-trimer vaccines also "generated strong memory responses, meaning the body would be better prepared to fight off HIV even long after vaccination," Cheetham noted. This would be thanks to antibody-producing memory B cells, which persist for a long time to help mount quick immune responses against germs they've encountered in the past, either through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human trial was primarily designed to look at the safety of the vaccines, and they were "well tolerated overall." They triggered mostly mild and transient side effects, such as fatigue, achiness, headache, chills, nausea and injection-site pain. However, hives, also called urticaria, were seen in seven participants, which the authors noted was "a far higher frequency than reported with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines." Several of the affected individuals experienced the skin reaction for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While most adverse reactions were mild and treatable, several people experienced a skin reaction," Cheetham said. "If these side effects can be reduced in next-generation versions and the results hold up in larger real-world studies in the community, mRNA vaccines could be a transformative tool in the fight against HIV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial had several other limitations. First, it was open-label, meaning the researchers and vaccine recipients knew which shots were being given, which can potentially bias the results. In addition, the vaccines were not specifically designed to make broadly neutralizing antibodies that can handle many strains but rather neutralizing antibodies that can tackle only select strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the trial results provide insight into the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines that code for HIV envelope trimers, the researchers noted. It should inform future efforts to refine these vaccines so they trigger more broadly protective antibody responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6-MriGtBfrG1608Ug1An2fNVxmBZvGiS1r" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6-MriGtBfrG1608Ug1An2fNVxmBZvGiS1r slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At this appointment, she also got Dysport, which is similar to Botox, for the first time.  Both injectables are formulated from the toxin that causes botulism to paralyze the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after her appointment, Wolaver claims she developed a migraine. The next day, she went to the hospital when she “couldn't function or string sentences together,” Wolaver, who hails from Good Hope, said, according to&lt;em&gt; Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says her health struggle began after getting injections to combat wrinkles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Abbievie, the manufacturer of Botox, and Galderma, the manufacturer of Dysport, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CT scan showed “nothing to do with the injection,” but her condition worsened, she said. Strong smells bothered her; She got dizzy quickly and relied heavily on her husband, Josh, 39, to care for their three children: Landen, 16, Braxton, 11, and Havyn, 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't be the mother I wanted for my three children,” said Wolaver, who struggled to walk, drive, and even move — leading her to think she was “slowly dying.” Doctors suspected multiple sclerosis or an autoimmune disorder. She had spinal taps and even a heart monitor implanted to diagnose the cause of her illness. It was only after she spent some time in an online forum that she learned what a possible source of her illness. After spending approximately $30,000 on tests, Wolaver learned she’d been having mini-strokes caused by iatrogenic &lt;a href="https://people.com/pesto-botulism-outbreak-6-people-sick-8710857" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:botulism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iatrogenic means an illness that comes from a medical procedure. Botulism is a rare but serious illness that’s generally caused by food tainted by the toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Botox is formulated from this same toxin, but as the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says, is purified and meets medical control standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botulism can occur after Botox “when the toxin circulates in the blood and produces effects remotely from the injection site,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00507.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; explained after a 2024 outbreak of botulism from Botox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says she thought she was "slowly dying" until she paid out-of-pocket for tests that said she had botulism.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of botulism may start within a few hours, and include trouble swallowing or speaking, nausea, trouble breathing, and blurred vision, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. “Recovery may take months and typically involves extended rehabilitation therapy,” the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/symptoms-causes/syc-20370262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says.

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;Wednesday, July 30, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Beta-HPV can directly cause skin cancer in immunocompromised people&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH case study finds virus drives creation of cancer cells in context of defective T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have shown for the first time that a type of human papillomavirus (HPV) commonly found on the skin can directly cause a form of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) when certain immune cells malfunction. cSCC is one of the most common cancers in the United States and worldwide. Previously, scientists believed HPV merely facilitated the accumulation of DNA mutations caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, usually the primary driver of cSCC. The findings were published today in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function,” said Andrea Lisco, M.D., Ph.D., of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of HPV, each tending to infect cells in a particular tissue and part of the body. The types of HPV found mostly on the skin—beta-HPV—are considered benign members of the skin &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Microbiome"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; that typically do not integrate into the DNA of skin cells. This contrasts with the alpha types of HPV, known to integrate into the DNA of mucous membrane cells and directly cause cancer of the genitals, anus, head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH researchers made their discovery in a 34-year-old woman who came to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation and treatment of recurrent cSCC on her forehead. She had undergone multiple surgeries and a round of immunotherapy to try to remove or kill the tumor, but it repeatedly grew back. Her local doctors thought this was due to an inherited inability to repair DNA damaged by UV radiation plus an impairment in immune cells called T cells. The tumor was one of many progressively worsening HPV-related diseases the woman was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a sophisticated genetic analysis, the NIH researchers discovered that a beta-HPV had integrated into the cellular DNA of the woman’s well-established tumor and was extensively producing viral proteins there&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This contradicted the prevailing theory that beta-HPV only facilitates the establishment of cSCC without integrating into cellular DNA and plays no role in maintaining the cancer&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Further genetic analysis of the woman’s cells showed they were fully capable of repairing DNA damage from UV radiation, suggesting the virus alone had caused cSCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how beta-HPV could take the unusual steps of integrating into the woman’s skin-cell DNA and multiplying there unchecked, the investigators studied the woman’s inherited immune disorder. They found that her genetic mutations greatly hampered T cells from activating in response to skin-cell infection by beta-HPV. This suggested that the immune disorder itself was responsible for the woman’s worsening HPV-related diseases, including the beta-HPV cSCC on her forehead, and that treating this disorder might cure all of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, NIH investigators developed a personalized plan to give the woman a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; to replace her defective T cells with healthy ones. The process required extreme care because she was immunocompromised even before treatment began. The transplant proceeded without complications. Afterward, all her HPV-related diseases including the recurrent, aggressive cSCC resolved and have not recurred during the more than three years since the transplant. This confirms that the woman’s inherited disorder had prevented her T cells from keeping beta-HPV in check, allowing the virus to directly cause and sustain cSCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof of the &lt;a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/"&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, their finding suggests that other people with defective T-cell responses may also be susceptible to cancer caused directly by beta-HPV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIAID conducts and supports research—at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide—to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses. News releases, fact sheets and other NIAID-related materials are available on the &lt;a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov"&gt;NIAID website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt; NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.

It’s long been thought to play a role in the development of skin cancer, but wasn’t believed to be a direct cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00deca" class="body-graf"&gt;Skin cancer is caused by DNA damage in skin cells. The most common source of that damage is ultraviolet radiation from the sun. HPV can help UV-damaged DNA build up in cells and turn cancerous. However, in the new case report, doctors found that the virus itself could cause cancerous lesions to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7e615" class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery was made in a 34-year-old woman with a weakened immune system; experts said it’s highly unlikely that HPV could play the same role in causing skin cancer in a person with a healthy immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a009e9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The virus replicated in a somewhat uncontrolled manner and ended up integrating into the skin cells and once they did that, they became cancerous,” said Dr. Andrea Lisco, section chief of the  mucosal and cutaneous viral immunopathogenesis unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH. Lisco was the woman’s doctor and also the senior author of the case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb1a6" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman had 43 spots of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma — the second-most common type of skin cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-groundbreaking-treatment-advanced-melanoma-rcna138005" target="_blank"&gt;after melanoma&lt;/a&gt; —  on her face, hands and legs. She had surgery to remove the cancers and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, but the cancer returned. When Lisco and his team biopsied several of her new tumors, they found that the woman’s skin cancer was being driven by something they hadn’t seen before: a group of HPVs called beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f214c4" class="body-graf"&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2019.00355/full" target="_blank"&gt;90% of people&lt;/a&gt; carry a strain of beta HPV. Usually, the virus lives on the skin and doesn’t integrate into the DNA of skin cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dcb85" class="body-graf"&gt;“We shake hands and we pick up those viruses, but if our immune systems are under control, we are fine,” Lisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45d028" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a different group of HPV strains — alpha HPVs — that are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank"&gt;linked to a range of cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha HPVs live on mucus membranes and can integrate into DNA, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-hpv-increasing-women-vaccine-safe-rcna196439" target="_blank"&gt;causing cancers of the cervix&lt;/a&gt;, anus, head and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-325ff8" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman in the case report had a genetic condition that weakened her T-cells (a type of immune cell), leaving her immunocompromised. This allowed the beta HPV living on her skin to behave more like alpha HPV, integrating its DNA into her skin cells and replicating undisturbed, turning the cells cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-451f9c" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t know how much you can directly apply the information from one patient to the wide variety of patients,” said Dr. Anthony Oro, professor of dermatology at Stanford Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01cc80" class="body-graf"&gt;However, “it suggests that, in the event that the T-cell arm of the immune system is not doing its job, beta-type HPV viruses could contribute to skin cancer, and maybe other kinds of cancers as well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8a450" class="body-graf"&gt;The patient needed a stem cell transplant, which replaced her defective T-cells with T-cells that could prevent the HPV from replicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We needed to give this patient a whole new immune system,” Lisco said. It worked. Three years post-transplant, the woman’s skin cancer has not returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976fd6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It gives us good information about how the interplay of the HPV and the immune system works,” said Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who also wasn’t involved with the woman’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ae22f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors have known for a long time that some beta HPVs cause changes on the skin, such as warts on the hands and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-638f59" class="body-graf"&gt;“HPV can integrate and cause changes in the cell cycle, especially in people with suppressed immune systems,” Rossi said. “What was novel about this is that they found out it was a beta HPV that integrated into the DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_small__gIJ9M" id="anchor-f77068"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1800"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg" alt="Squamous cell carcinoma"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lip in a 50-year-old woman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69a14b" class="body-graf"&gt;Other researchers have speculated this was a possibility based on studies in mice, but the new report shows that it can occur in humans. How many people could be at risk is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810d51" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is just one patient, and they have this unique situation of an immunological condition that enables the beta HPV to replicate unchecked,” Oro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-826dd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Other biopsies of squamous skin cancers have not detected HPV, meaning not all cases are  caused by the viruses. Lisco said that the original notion — that HPV passively contributes to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by helping UV radiation damage skin cells, but doesn’t actively help cancer grow — is still the likely explanation for many people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24b12c" class="body-graf"&gt;For them, “protection from UV would be the prevention,” Lisco said — wearing sunscreen and covering up your skin from the sun — adding that immunocompromised people should be monitored more closely. People with weakened immune systems are as much as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430974/" target="_blank"&gt;100 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f7cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The Gardasil HPV vaccine protects against nine strains of alpha HPV and has been shown to lower rates of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/hpv-vaccine-benefits-exceed-expectations-may-lead-elimination-cervical-cancer-n1022206" target="_blank"&gt;cervical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-linked-lower-rates-head-neck-cancer-males-study-finds-rcna153759" target="_blank"&gt;head and neck cancers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear how much cross-protection, if any, the vaccine provides against other strains of HPV, including beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b35e8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even if this strain is not in the vaccine, there is some theory that there is cross-talk between HPV strains,” Rossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49faf6" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people will get HPV in their lifetimes. Scientists have so far identified about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-11-human-papillomavirus.html#:~:text=licensed%20in%202014.-,Human%20Papillomavirus%20(HPV),about%2066%25%20of%20cervical%20cancers." target="_blank"&gt;200 unique&lt;/a&gt; strains of the virus. Alpha-HPV, with its well-established links to cancer, has thus far been the primary subject of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09a975" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This suggests that this other side of the family might also be important in situations where our immune system is not doing its job,” Oro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRjN5SzhHMDdvTkFBSHloektKbTNaTFFPbFowalBqS1JsUUtJeDZzak5sX3ZLT0pHT2p4cHFlZEtDV3RnMXpqN2RWSXVhWGN5UE9lVDM5YmsxR2pKYjlCMEUwSXFoOEtjT0ttVWE2ZmNGWjNwbnNWTk1NVjRmcE5xNEdNVWp2QlRNLW42MHhFSjJpYmRjR1E0bXhlSC3SAVZBVV95cUxPaGdDVHNndjhsTmFDUHNZSmJYeHRPT1hLTUlDaWM0NVlHOTVYT0JxVXVGWkNUZEFUbzZBbXFKeVRVNk13SFM1dVRhSGR2NDlXYmxtNVd3UQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
