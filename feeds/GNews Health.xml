It’s a trend that experts worry could have deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32f367" class="body-graf"&gt;Babies are born with very low levels of vitamin K, a nutrient the body needs for blood to clot, leaving them at risk for severe bleeding early in life. In the early 1960s, hospitals in the United States began giving newborns shots of the vitamin within the first six hours of birth to prevent bleeding, including bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc2a87" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the leader of the study, said he and his co-authors noticed &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/vitamin-k-shot-hesitancy-babies-rcna57476" target="_blank"&gt;a rise in parents turning down the shot&lt;/a&gt; in their own practices, prompting the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dd84e" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Scott said, he wasn’t fully expecting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ffa1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The increase is not surprising, but the degree to which it did increase did catch me off guard,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de157f" class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed electronic medical record data from Epic Systems’ Cosmos database, which included whether an infant received a vitamin K shot. The study included more than 5 million babies born in 403 hospitals in all 50 states, from 2017 through 2024. The researchers found that about 4% of babies — about 200,000 — born in this time frame didn’t get vitamin K shots. The percentage rose from less than 3% in 2017 to more than 5% in 2024. The trend was highest among non-Hispanic white babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7585d5" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate really started increasing from 2019 to 2020, and accelerated during and after the Covid pandemic, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d379bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Scott said there haven’t been any large policy changes regarding vitamin K shots from hospitals, nor changes in recommendations from medical organizations. That means the rise in babies not getting vitamin K shots is almost certainly due to parental refusal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ddb54" class="body-graf"&gt;Reports of a trend go back before 2017. A 2016 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/6/1/15/26290/Reasons-for-Refusal-of-Newborn-Vitamin-K" target="_blank"&gt;Hospital Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; looked at why parents refuse the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739bf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Widespread misinformation on social media and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/life-changing-impact-diseases-anti-vaccination-era-rcna215968" target="_blank"&gt;rising vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt; are likely contributing to an uptick in the number of parents refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, said Dr. Tiffany McKee-Garrett, an associate professor of pediatrics at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-338a45" class="body-graf"&gt;“Parents are equating vitamin K injections to vaccines,” McKee-Garrett said, adding that a vitamin K shot is not a vaccine, but a supplement derived from a plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-297bbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ivan Hand, director of neonatology at NYC Health + Hospitals Kings County in Brooklyn, has also noticed the trend in his practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44bb6f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think this comes from general mistrust in authority that started probably in the later part of the 2010s,” said Hand, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f521d6" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2022, Hand co-authored an &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/3/e2021056036/184866/Vitamin-K-and-the-Newborn-Infant" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement&lt;/a&gt; on parents refusing vitamin K shots for newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64eef1" class="body-graf"&gt;Newborns who don’t get a vitamin K shot are more than 80 times more likely to have bleeding from vitamin K deficiency than those who get the shot, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Bleeding can happen up to six months after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-713eaf" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are creating a population of newborns who are at risk of bleeding,” Scott said, adding that this could include anything from bruising, to losing blood when the umbilical cord is cut, to gastrointestinal bleeding. “Bleeding into the brain is what we really worry about, essentially a stroke,” he said. “That can ultimately cause death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fc4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the drop in the number of infants getting the shot that doctors are seeing correlates to a rise in the number of cases of bleeding from vitamin K deficiency in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-421055" class="body-graf"&gt;Hand said he has not seen an increase in his practice, but added that he only sees infants just after they are born. Scott said he believes further research will find an increase in bleeding events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f77675" class="body-graf"&gt;“We know unequivocally that when infants do not receive vitamin K, they are at increased risk of bleeding,” he said, adding that at CHOP, there has not only been an increase in vitamin K refusal, but also an increase in bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38255a" class="body-graf"&gt;In Houston, McKee-Garrett has heard reports of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, something that was extremely rare for decades after the U.S. began widely giving vitamin K shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb9e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a preventable disease, so we shouldn’t be seeing it at all,” Hand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-494c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;In some countries, babies are given oral doses of vitamin K supplements. However, these &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8424792/" target="_blank"&gt;formulas can be inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; and each baby’s digestive system absorbs different amounts of the nutrient, Hand said, adding that breast milk is also not a good enough source of vitamin K to prevent deficiency. Oral vitamin K supplements also need to be given multiple times, whereas the vitamin shots only need to be given once. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862383/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Europe have also shown that while oral vitamin K supplementation may be effective in the first week of life, it may be much less effective at preventing late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can occur up to 6 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad663e" class="body-graf"&gt;“That late-onset bleeding, the bleeding that occurs internally, has a 20% mortality rate,” McKee-Garrett said. Some studies have found it to be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929546/" target="_blank"&gt;as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e451" class="body-graf"&gt;Because vitamin K shots have been widely given in the U.S. for more than 60 years, Hand said parents may not understand the risk of forgoing the prophylactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2d087" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These treatments have been so effective that people don’t understand the consequences. They have never seen babies with severe bleeding, so they think it doesn’t exist,” he said. “But you don’t see it because we are treating these kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQcEZSMEwxbHNsQjNzQklmY0JNT3JLTzRHMm9hdkhidzZtTzdzQW5nc1RPRWNGbTF6cko3VUpjRFdIQ1haSUhVZnNnbG81TUJBZDJYSkVaVEc5WTdJVVNOSVpra3lZSGVMMVZ5bnF3RGszZ3FXcmcydFp6dkE1MWQ3aFoyNnVPdk96RnhtUlNXY3BaV0huRl8zZGt2WHdDSENaU01tejZ4QUp3UjTSAVZBVV95cUxOcGZQZ09GT3NJNXpOa0wwZkhVS1NTREZ2Sko5b0FSSUpnUkY4U05BOVJtaXpsdnRNTENtMXZHMlVISUJTcVpGS1lJVWRSVkl6dHVHNUxUQQ</guid></item><item><title>癌症正在飙升，引发关于是否寻找癌症的争论-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/cancer-young-people-deaths.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:37:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE53Q21zX2lFTGF1bFo4aS1VaE1qZkpjOFJNakF0ZXUtV0FDYXRoOUVFOUIzRjluYjE2ZHhiSVZ2SGxxZ21jTUloMjlOLXBiVWhaLVpVa1JGaHlkci1OdVlqWXE3Mk1nT2p5MzNEV2paQXdxNEJlQmRVOUF0bGh1Zw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员表示，社交媒体的使用会损害儿童的注意力集中能力-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/08/social-media-damages-childrens-ability-to-focus</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Increased use of social media by children damages their concentration levels and may be contributing to an increase in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peer-reviewed report&lt;/a&gt; monitored the development of more than 8,300 US-based children from the age of 10 to 14 and linked social media use to “increased inattention symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Reseachers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Oregon &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Science University in the US found that children spent an average of 2.3 hours a day watching television or online videos, 1.4 hours on social media and 1.5 hours playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No link was found between &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/adhd-children-teenagers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ADHD-related symptoms &lt;/a&gt;– such as being easily distracted – and playing video games or watching TV and YouTube. However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/06/adhd-medication-drugs-risks-benefits-children-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; with symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Torkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMG11TmFRdjBYMWZlanc3ZFgyNFpzQ0U1NWlRMkIwdk1jQVQ5SFg0VDY0RXM4MkdPbXVZaU9SYTgyb2Y1em5uek9vUmdscURZWUZlUWw5bFc4a3p1QVlvWHBmelR1OXBRYmxuSVZFb19ZNmxITlU0RGwxc3dYOFVIUmRrVlhFd3RHWk05Y2Z5d05hbDJWR1dQdmdwN0xIelk</guid></item><item><title>在英格兰发现新的mpox毒株- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2087g0z9po</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;New mpox strain identified in England&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Philippa Roxby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Health reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/db8b/live/912f5bb0-d444-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A representation of the mpox (monkeypox) virus under a microscope.

			&lt;p&gt;When the brain's typical wiring patterns shift from the norm, it leads to psychotic disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="184295" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers have identified 'brainquakes' that disrupt the brain's connectivity in people who live with these conditions and experience debilitating psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping out the role these brainquakes play, the research team hopes to get a better understanding of common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-psychosis-may-be-fundamentally-flawed-study-finds"&gt;brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps a step closer to treatment interventions that can help manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint Where Extreme Moods of Bipolar Disorder Exist in Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, these brainquakes are an imbalance between the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2021.07.008"&gt;redundancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01070-0"&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt; of brain networks, whereby brain cell circuits process either shared or complementary information, respectively. Redundancy makes the brain more robust, while synergy allows it to extract more information from related inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of the people with psychotic disorders were noticeably &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-reveals-how-often-cannabis-triggers-psychotic-episodes"&gt;more unbalanced&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found, showing more irregular and random connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions," Qiang Li, a &lt;span&gt;computational&lt;/span&gt; neuroscientist at the TReNDS (Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science) Center in Atlanta, and colleagues &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed detailed brain scans of 1,111 participants, including 288 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;with schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, 183 with bipolar disorder, and 640 healthy controls. &lt;span&gt;Each scan lasted about five minutes, with the analysis tuned to find higher-order (more complex) interactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg" alt="Brain regions" class="wp-image-184298 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains-600x500.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers mapped brain domains and the communications between them. The left cortex of the brain is shown here, with regions affected by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder labelled, including sensorimotor (SM) and visual (VI) domains. (Li et al., &lt;em&gt;Mol. Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainquakes were detected 'rumbling' across the brains of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder far more than in the healthy controls, affecting brain regions linked to emotions, memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-discovered-a-new-human-sense-of-touch"&gt;sensory information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brainquakes are like active volcanoes, the researchers say, with particular networks in the brains of people with psychotic disorders showing a tendency toward sudden and regular disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since the participants were all considered psychiatrically stable during the experiment, and the scans were taken during a resting state, the quakes aren't necessarily linked to psychotic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the severe impact of psychotic states on multiscale critical brain networks, suggesting a profound alteration in the brain's complexity and organizational states," Li and colleagues &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research gives scientists a fascinating new look into the brains of people who live with psychotic disorders, though further studies will be required to track the pattern and the frequency of these brainquakes over periods longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work is needed to look at how brainquakes might affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-driving-choices-could-be-hiding-signs-of-future-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers say. At the moment, it's not clear if these disruptions are helping to drive psychotic disorders or are something that's a consequence of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is such a sophisticated network system that it makes picking apart the causes of conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder very challenging, though progress is being made. We're getting better at identifying people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-new-blood-test-predicts-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;at a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of these conditions, for example, through biomarkers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know about some of the triggers that can cause psychotic episodes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-potency-cannabis-linked-to-dramatically-higher-risk-of-psychotic-episodes"&gt;high-potency cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these discoveries tells us a bit more about what the brain is doing when it takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-discovery-helps-explain-how-cannabis-triggers-psychosis"&gt;a few steps outside of reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the latest figures, as many &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/psychosis/"&gt;as 3 in 100 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US will have a psychotic episode at some point in their lives – and while there are ways of managing these conditions, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-new-schizophrenia-treatment-in-decades-a-much-needed-alternative"&gt;continue to work&lt;/a&gt; on finding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-drugs-may-have-been-off-target-for-decades-study-finds"&gt;more effective treatments&lt;/a&gt; with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a short-term memory issue,” Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Day, there are some real-world, practical issues he tends to look for as potential memory red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for people who have made mistakes, maybe with medications, where they wouldn’t have before [such as forgetting to take it or taking a double dose], perhaps some difficulty keeping track of appointments and keeping the days straight, needing more reminders for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short-term memory loss could also look like missing appointments or showing up on the wrong day or having difficulty finding their way along a familiar route, Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally more forgetful than others and have been that way all of their lives. That’s not worrisome. Instead, Day is concerned with “changes from before that are consistent or starting to become consistent, that are beginning to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble with the ‘planning part of your brain.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for people to experience trouble with “executive functioning,” which Nothelle describes as the “planning part of your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if you have a complex task, [for example] you have to plan a dinner party and you’re having a hard time doing everything involved ... there’s all these little logistics and things to keep track of when planning something like a dinner party,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have to remember your guest’s dietary restrictions, plan out a menu, shop for ingredients, cook, arrange serving dishes, clean, make cocktails and choose a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not able to do that anymore, that can be a sign that there’s something going on,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;While dementia can present in many different ways, short-term memory loss and personality changes are among the early signs of the disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personality changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way that I have seen it manifest is people will have changes in their mood or their personality,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a loved one who used to be very outgoing is now more shy or vice versa. Or maybe someone is more apathetic or, perhaps, more impulsive than they used to be. This isn’t normal aging or an older person just not having a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all just reflections of subtle changes in the brain,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consistent trouble finding the right word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint and reason people seek medical attention is word-finding difficulty, Day said. “Occasional difficulty coming up with a name, fine,” said Day. It’s also normal to sometimes forget the name of a common object, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s inconsistent, not a concern, but when this is an everyday thing and maybe even when it’s interrupting conversation, now that’s a sign of much more prominent word-finding difficulty that would warrant evaluation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Susceptibility to financial scams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that we need to be really, really aware of, and unfortunately just gets more and more common, is susceptibility to financial scams,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with dementia are at increased risk, and scammers know that, so they tend to prey on older individuals in the middle of the afternoon,” added Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is shame involved with falling for a scam, but scammers are getting smarter and sneakier, making it easier and easier to fall for the trick, noted Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you have a loved one who falls for one of these scams, it’s worth inquiring about their cognitive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is common, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy lifestyle habits &lt;a href="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can not only slow the progression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;can not only slow the progression&lt;/a&gt; of dementia but can also help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, genetics put them at higher risk of developing dementia, but “even in people where there is a genetic component, there’s good evidence to say that all of the following still make an impact, and maybe make an even bigger impact,” Fleisher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, folks should follow the advice from their doctors when it comes to maintaining a healthy body — these habits also help maintain a healthy brain, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important things that I think about ... well, we should be screening for high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar problems, and treating or addressing those problems when they exist,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should also prioritize a good night’s sleep, he said, and manage things like sleep apnea — “addressing that and treating that effectively can really improve brain health and brain function, and, I think, decrease the risk of dementia in the future,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then there’s the day-to-day things, good brain housekeeping things, we all know we should be doing,” Day said. This includes exercising, eating a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and veggies, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alcohol-link-serious-illnesses_l_68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563?origin=life-featured" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="limiting (or not drinking) alcohol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;limiting (or not drinking) alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and quitting smoking. It’s also helpful to spend time with other people, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can sometimes seem daunting. If you’re reading a long list of things and you’re not doing any of them, you don’t have to start doing them all immediately,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take that small step forward ... introduce a 20-minute walk three times a week — you don’t have to start training for a marathon,” Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are positive steps towards brain health, and if the goal is to reduce the future risk of dementia, I think each of those steps matters and can be helpful for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a cure for dementia, these changes can help people who are diagnosed, Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to use everything at our disposal to slow down progression so people can live longer and live better and have better quality of life in that time,” Fleisher said. “There are countless examples of people living well with dementia. I think that stigma of getting this diagnosis and that being ‘the end,’ that is not where we are in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia are living rich, full lives because they’re empowered by knowledge and helpful health care teams, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPMy1KclcyWng4WHBERlpfZlpydTVCaE8zdXo4S05Vc09pNTU0cGRsT09jYnpNQ3pVLUNELWxsV0F2SE55TzVodlo4V1I2M0s3eDBvempmV1RiaG9SRy1KdURpaEtoSlVxQzAzeHZrU2k5M2V6c044LUtQd0RMODBETkJfX2pMWkhUek9EVDV6T1JRZEU5T0Jr0gGcAUFVX3lxTE0xRW9pQVAwVG1Cd3ZhZUZGTnFOb2N4WEg5NENTYjAyazE1WmhpWV9iYnp3UE1LaTZyRmM4RFhnVDI2dVBuOHJKRTlaU3RSOUhNYUswQnFVMVhrVHRDd2tZZHUySkM3T21PYUd4WktOOGRSNkl1SmZKLTZGTkFBb3poYUlSckYxSUhyT3dLY0RXX0FiLV8wVDNTb2RiRg</guid></item><item><title>美国男子接受受感染肾脏后死于狂犬病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/us-man-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-infected-kidney</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A recipient of a kidney transplant presented a medical mystery when he died from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2017.91"&gt;rabies&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 only weeks after his surgery in an Ohio hospital, despite having had no documented contact with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close investigation by the CDC revealed the cause: The Michigan man's donor kidney was infected by the deadly  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; – only the fourth time rabies has been transmitted via transplanted organs in the US since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, the CDC says, highlights the need for stronger guidance for transplant teams where the donor has a history of exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rabies-is-a-deadly-unpredictable-threat-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabies Is a Deadly, Unpredictable Threat. Here's How to Protect Yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral pathogen that spreads typically via the saliva of infected animals, usually through bites or scratches. Capable of infecting all mammals, including humans, the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms appear; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0711"&gt;fewer than 50&lt;/a&gt; cases of survival have been documented worldwide, with medical specialists rarely succeeding in keeping patients alive despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaf157"&gt;extreme measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt; most often occurs from dog bites, but any infected mammal can transmit the disease. The donor in this case, an Idaho man, had been found unresponsive after a presumed cardiac arrest in early December 2024, around five weeks after being scratched by a skunk in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one suspected the involvement of rabies at the time. So as the man was an organ donor, his heart, lungs, left kidney, and corneas were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five weeks after receiving the kidney, the Michigan patient developed symptoms consistent with rabies. Doctors sent samples of his saliva, skin, and other fluids to the CDC, which detected rabies virus RNA in some of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the recipient had no history of animal exposure, investigators turned back to the donor. A stored serum sample from the Idaho man tested negative for rabies  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, but an archived biopsy of his kidney was positive for rabies virus RNA, confirming the organ as the source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan recipient died on the seventh day after hospitalization, but he may have saved other lives. The donor's heart and lungs were used for training at a Maryland research facility and did not pose a risk, but three other patients had received corneal grafts from the donor's corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors immediately removed the transplanted corneas and prescribed the patients a course of highly effective Post-exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP – human rabies antibodies plus a vaccine given before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials assessed 357 possible contacts of both the donor and the kidney recipient. In total, 46 people – including healthcare workers, community contacts, and the cornea recipients – were advised to receive PEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events highlights a vulnerability in the current donor system. While the donor's risk assessment interview documented the skunk scratch, his symptoms hadn't been recognized as consistent with rabies, so his skunk encounter wasn't raised as a testable rabies risk until after the kidney recipient had died as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since rabies testing on donor organs is not routine, and no one raised any red flags, the transplants took place as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies can take weeks to months to become symptomatic after transmission. The CDC advises significantly more caution with donors who have had a potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a potential donor, particularly one with acute &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"&gt;encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, had a bite or scratch from a rabies-susceptible animal during the preceding year, transplant teams should consider consulting public health officials to determine rabies risk," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;the organization writes in its report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If an organ or tissue has been transplanted from a donor who is subsequently suspected to have had rabies, a risk assessment could save lives by accelerating diagnostic testing, possible explantation when deemed clinically appropriate, and PEP administration to recipients and other contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see the CDC's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

One, two, a few, several? If you’ve taught your algorithm that you’re open to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-treatment-natural-remedy-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;alternative wellness solutions&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is likely more than zero. Perhaps you’ve been made to bear witness to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgD_LOx_5q/?igsh=bmRic3doZDdhYnR0"&gt;long, gnarly, brown ropes&lt;/a&gt; laid out on paper towels. Maybe you’ve seen a pile of what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIhAtuozWtM/?igsh=MXhld2V3a2s5eHRtZQ%3D%3D"&gt;spaghetti squash&lt;/a&gt; floating in a toilet. You may have been treated to pics of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-_wZlOJAq/?igsh=YWJpbHNrN3F0b2Zy"&gt;shriveled, dried-apricot–like bits&lt;/a&gt; harvested from a stranger’s feces. Given the many poop posts, you’d be forgiven for believing that the entire internet-using population is teeming with intestinal worms, which these posters say they’ve expelled with “parasite cleanses” before snapping a pic and slapping up a Reel or TikTok to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitatlk3001g3b78fp5ujh0w@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;Over the summer, supermodel &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/heidi-klum-parasite-cleanse-update.html"&gt;Heidi Klum&lt;/a&gt; unwittingly stoked parasite panic by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/heidi-klum-project-runway-return-routine-d0292c92"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;she was undertaking her first cleanse. “Everything I’m getting on my Instagram feed at the moment is about worms and parasites,” Klum said in the interview. “I heard that you’re supposed to do this once a year, and I’ve never done it. So I feel like I’m really behind. I don’t know what the heck is going to come out.” By November, Klum had cleansed, but the results were unclear. “So many people asked me, too, like, ‘What happened?’” she told &lt;a href="https://people.com/heidi-klum-reveals-results-worm-cleanse-exclusive-11853373"&gt;&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m like, ‘I don’t even know if anything happened!’” There had been no smoking gun, no writhing toilet of expelled creatures — but also no statement of regret. In fact, Klum exclaimed that “it just felt good,” since any parasites that might have been there “were leaving the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswc2000c3b782y5l3mv5@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;Klum had embarked on the endeavor repeating an adage often spouted by those in the cleanse community: &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; has parasites, and they just don’t know it. A common stat bandied about is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8GXs4qwrw"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; percent of the population. Wild as the figure may sound, the notion has just enough plausibility to pass many folks’ b.s. detectors. Don’t tiny, imperceptible mites live on our eyelashes? Don’t dogs get worms, scooting their butts on the carpet for relief? Is it then so crazy to think that wriggling menaces may have colonized our colons, too? Toss in the ardent proselytizing of online “experts” and those eye-popping photos, and you can see how someone might be swayed. It also doesn’t hurt that cleanses are made to seem “natural,” almost spa-like, consisting of earthy stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z8OQGW/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B004Z8OQGW&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=7JegY&amp;amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=6KPVXF5QRJN01398T2RC&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=3F7kw&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=0c0d1fdb-5bee-4c2e-ba3a-5d1ec68e16ff&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;black walnut, wormwood, clove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Cleanse-Tincture-Wormwood-Burdock/dp/B0DYDFHTF1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;burdock root&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Advanced-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B078NCFVVJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=27PCYLMKMUKHC&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wYdlgiKKHJg2VkdNBBYI0w-zh4UHUI-lVfekSxUs-YY4ORxdPEXkc4YmqF_49QOgnnlQHOYkfl7fVd64TPCJW5jIHpzBlv3eysd_uHA6rsli1iJZGHg4TGX7FuAPpQMrIdXfHgarnOzZ6yHaIb4IJxABR6oykJY03_vGDV2ycV6MQVD1BNxNDlGc2X13QeaNwhwHLIGCy9svUMx2ykF482ucP6zRcwnXbYS1E4RnuCV9Y_uRWXI0hEBAmOKozcxAy2oRBafe_br3Beo0Y9p1OIsxAbsEmypirC1YQs62_F4.YhXy1H9ugtPt4SkwftJj1VwVUjUJ-tyjrLz_B988TwQ&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Bfor%2Bhumans&amp;amp;qid=1763860877&amp;amp;s=hpc&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Chpc%2C100&amp;amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But trying to dissuade cleanse believers often only deepens their conviction. Disavowal by the medical community is viewed not as scientific sensemaking but as, at best, dogmatic myopia, and at worst, evidence of a shady allegiance to Big Pharma — a desire to keep you sick so they can sell you bogus cures. As is true of many facets of American life these days, parasite mania seems to be a disagreement between two realities: one in which the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;medical Establishment is the utmost health authority (or at least it was until recently), and one in which &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; care is purveyed by the truth tellers this same Establishment shuns.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s more complicated than, say, vaccine hesitancy, in which one side is demonstrably correct and the other side refuses to believe it. With intestinal worms, we face a paradoxical truth: They are both less common and more common than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswj7000g3b788jnj1z5k@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“A lot of the people who feel they are infected with parasites are not,” says Dr. Daniel Griffin, a clinical instructor of medicine and infectious-disease specialist at Columbia and president of &lt;a href="https://parasiteswithoutborders.com/our-mission/"&gt;Parasites Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, an advocacy organization dedicated to addressing global parasitic illness. “But the other side,” he continues, “is that people out there actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; having issues related to parasites but are not being diagnosed.” The double-edged sword of parasitic infection is that its symptoms — diarrhea, bloating, nausea, gas — are common enough that one could attribute them to anything from indigestion to a hangover, but these symptoms are also common enough that, if someone told you everyone has worms and you believed them, those symptoms might be enough to convince you that you have them, too. Ask a roomful of people if they’ve had diarrhea, bloating, nausea, or gas in the last month, and 90 percent are likely to raise their hand.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the global population has some form of intestinal worm, known as a helminth, though that jumps to as high as 50 percent in tropical and subtropical regions. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Most&lt;/a&gt; helminths spread via human feces, especially in places where people defecate outside; when feces contains worm eggs, the soil it touches becomes contaminated, and if that soil is used to grow food, the parasite spreads. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Hookworms and strongyloides&lt;/a&gt;, however, can latch onto a host through the soles of their feet if walked on barefoot; tapeworms and trichinella can enter your body through undercooked meat; and flukes can be caught by ingesting contaminated water or fish. The most common global helminth is &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;, a roundworm that affects 1 billion people worldwide. While helminths are generally not deadly, if allowed to proliferate, some can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;bowel obstruction, inflammation, and chronic malnutrition&lt;/a&gt; in children; if the host is pregnant, some worms can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;detrimental&lt;/a&gt; to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;

Pinworms live in the digestive tract and can be diagnosed using the “tape test”: After the suspected host falls asleep, pinworms venture out to lay eggs, and a piece of tape is placed on the anus to capture them. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21137-pinworms"&gt;Two doses of an anti-parasitic&lt;/a&gt; and a load of laundry later (to rid bedsheets and clothes of eggs), the host is cured. But treatment requires diagnosis, and hosts don’t always know they have pinworms — around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6522669/#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20have%20also%20been,seek%20medical%20advice%20(4)."&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; percent of cases are asymptomatic. Even if symptoms are present, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Parasitology/comments/1behxom/did_my_pinworms_really_dissapear_by_themselves/"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.pinworms-care-instructions.ut3181"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; may be too embarrassed to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

They can be hostile. Most doctors, to be honest, will put delusional parasitosis at the top of their differential, and things just go south from there.” In other words, even if you’re right, telling a GP you have worms and refusing to entertain other possibilities might get you written off as just another internet faddist or maybe even someone with a mental-health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, because they are certain they have a parasite, they see a medical doctor. “You can imagine how challenging that can be for many physicians,” says &lt;a href="https://manhattancbt.com/paul-greene-phd/"&gt;Paul Greene&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Manhattan Center for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, who has expertise in health anxiety. “They have to rule out the presence of parasites, but they’re really dealing with a psychiatric condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

To the wide, unregulated, FDA-unapproved world of parasite cleanses, sold on Amazon, on Etsy, and by countless independent cleanse purveyors. While it’s difficult to gauge exactly how many people use them, Amazon reviews give some indication: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Digestive-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B016LBZSDK/ref=sr_1_9?crid=8UWUS5TVYSG0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TjZyHd6WUmsyC_ZhdTaJ5AA6gmGZNtIRxUTlu1RjDMgYWq1nsnt2h3bls-YZJXI5HcxaXeYEc9TLRs3udtHQJ9lgNyBvvZf9xaymnokZ-qUk9kekeKMpuxtPmlzl1aRQIRukcm5giHG4UPAtEQrvcpEP-umJz7MSmwZovYm82XytqqORIHWGL_9atoMMXzlEGvc9KrLrFdyYRm2AihJfnLZGkXE5boZy3xvkMWmvWcukg8a1vNWB0oC3q5KgIBfMAuzLOITe90rjrV6ZO8CQFR_4FAEut1tITcWXLTH-NKE.f-zwkLpvOr3bfZhzxStDLJ-FIQ1VhSNOR0ponF-_h-4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse&amp;amp;qid=1764078199&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Caps%2C146&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;ParaGuard&lt;/a&gt; ($29.90), one of the most popular options, had 30,451 reviews at press time. Interestingly, some of these clearly parasite-invoking options don’t actually use the word &lt;em&gt;parasite&lt;/em&gt; in their product descriptions, most likely because the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/questions-and-answers-health-claims-food-labeling"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; supplement manufacturers from making medical claims related to treating disease. Many people, however, opt for cleanses they read about in online testimonials or hear about via word of mouth — which is precisely how Shannon Nesbitt, of Kauai, found her favorite cleanse, &lt;a href="https://www.thesanctuaryholisticwellness.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor4YE9VCG3-NPwnNdgV8b8NwdTa99vkZlvqs8KAhlyqZ0g03_jg"&gt;Sanctuary Holistic Wellness&lt;/a&gt; ($377). “My friend did it,” says Nesbitt, who is 55, “and she’s vegan, and she had all these worms come out — so I figured if she has them, I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have them.” Nesbitt suffered from constipation and, after her friend’s experience, wondered if parasites might be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

It was recommended that the cleanse be conducted around the time of a full moon. The psyllium husk was to be taken only with Concord grape juice. One day, Nesbitt ingested a mixture of olive oil, ruby-red grapefruit juice, and Epsom salts before lying on one side, per the instructions; this was to purge gallstones, and she says she passed hundreds the following day. Then there were the worms: “I was surprised,” Nesbitt says. “There were these big, long, white worms, and a lot of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/liver-fluke"&gt;liver flukes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

A cleanse isn’t a onetime medical treatment so much as a long-term self-care routine.&lt;/p&gt;

I messaged her to talk. She replied, but I was confused when she referred me to her husband, Christian — until it turned out that he isn’t just a fellow fan of parasite cleanses but actually recommends them as part of his health-coaching business, &lt;a href="https://www.healingunited.today/home"&gt;Healing United&lt;/a&gt;, which he runs alongside his business partner, a primary-care doctor in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

And you kind of go, &lt;em&gt;If that’s in me, maybe it’s not the only one&lt;/em&gt;.” Elliot went to a naturopath, where he underwent two stool tests that came back negative for parasites; still, he tried her worm protocol. “I couldn’t make it all the way,” he says. “It was two weeks of suffering. I was in so much pain from the die-off.” (In the cleanse world, this refers to an extinction burst of toxins released as parasites and bacteria gradually die inside of you.) Another cleanse he tried induced “one hot-fire bowel movement, but no worms came out that I could see.”&lt;/p&gt;

He turned to the practitioners he’d been working with at Healing United, which, he says, was initially founded as a means of detoxing people injured by COVID vaccines. (Other topics Elliot touched on during our chat: chemtrails, changing the MMR vaccine schedule, and the potential dangers of fluoride.) Ultimately, Elliot and his team landed on a complex program of tinctures, herbs, fiber, “binders” (a material that attaches to dying parasites’ toxins to help flush them out, like clay), and three weeks of daily enemas. He says the results are startling. “I had a client two weeks ago who told me, ‘I just passed what looked like a bowl full of angel-hair pasta.’” Elliot says he himself passed “a bowlful” of pinworms (is a bowl the standard unit of worm measurement?), along with many red, marble-size liver flukes.&lt;/p&gt;

Turpentine, castor oil, these are wildly effective at poisoning. Tapeworms especially don’t like turpentine; they hate it.” He also mentions the benefits of clay, charcoal, and a half-dozen essential oils.&lt;/p&gt;

While he concedes that emergency services and trauma care are worthwhile uses of traditional medicine, he’s philosophically opposed to its other applications. “It sounds hyperbolic, but it’s anti-human. It’s symptom, symptom, symptom. ‘Don’t bother me with why this is happening, I just want to treat your symptom,’ which leads to another symptom and another. The model of pharmaceuticals is chemical intervention, and they’re trying to figure out how much poison they can give you without giving you a side effect or killing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

And if I did that cleanse and got really sick, that person is not going to take any responsibility for me because they’re not a medical professional. They don’t see the end result of what they’re doing.” (The website of Elliot’s company mentions that “a doctor and a coach” are available for “Code Red” calls should any unpleasant symptoms arise — but nowhere does it recommend simply going to the ER if a Code Red situation should occur.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxzs00133b78893np9v1@published" data-word-count="169"&gt;“Mucus,” Wallace says. “Undigested food. Intestinal lining. You ever notice how none of the ‘worms’ are moving?” Dr. Griffin told me something similar — that sloughed-off bits of intestine and fibrous vegetables that don’t get fully broken down can look like worms, provided you don’t know what worms look like. None of the photos he’s seen online or unsolicited specimens he’s viewed in person show segments on the worms, which is characteristic of tapeworms, and he’s yet to see any that are moving, the way pinworms would be. The Mayo Clinic also has an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/expert-answers/gallbladder-cleanse/faq-20058134#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20a%20gallbladder,below%20and%20resubmit%20the%20form."&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; for those hundreds of “gallstones” Nesbitt passed: Because most gallstone cleanses involve olive oil, what cleansers are seeing is just globs of “oil, juice, and other materials.” Wallace continues, “Normal people are not passing these things; it’s likely a result of the cleanse — just not in the way they think. Not to mention that half the time online they don’t show a picture of what came out; they just &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; it came out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy2u00153b78i7s781r2@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Griffin had an answer for this: “Possibly because the cleanse has accidentally corrected a dysbiosis,” he says, referring to an imbalance of microorganisms in the gut. “In their head, they think, &lt;em&gt;I feel better because I treated my parasite&lt;/em&gt;. The reality is they might feel better because they’ve improved their microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;

They want to use it for COVID, for cancer. It’s like, this is its time to shine, people.” (Ivermectin’s star turn began during the pandemic, when a rash of skeptics began using the dewormer, which is generally used in livestock, to treat COVID against the advice of doctors.) When Wallace says “they,” she seems to mean some variation on &lt;em&gt;people who don’t trust science&lt;/em&gt;. Without ever mentioning them by name, I get the feeling that we’re talking about adherents to and peddlers within the MAHA movement, who, alongside their own legitimately worm-bedeviled leader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., believe they’ll Make America Healthy Again.&lt;/p&gt;

But that really doesn’t matter to these people. They go off personal narrative and appeal to emotion. And that’s effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

Surely others are fed up with America’s exploitive medical industrial complex and are looking for a way around it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy8l00193b78r87ra042@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;“I think some of it is distrust of the health-care system,” says Wallace, seeming to intuit my thoughts, “and this idea that doctors just want to make money by peddling pharmaceuticals. But if you see a doctor for an anti-parasitic, yes, the visit might cost money, but you’d take a couple doses of generic medication. Whereas if you go on Instagram and buy months of this regimen, that’s way more money.” Wallace also acknowledges that internet medicine may be the only kind some people can access: “Maybe they don’t have insurance, so these wellness fads are something they do in lieu of going to the doctor. They think they’re really doing something good.” Or maybe there are, as she says, “just a lot of fringe ideas online. I mean, there’s a whole Facebook group for people who drink urine for health reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasya7001a3b78ulhvlkov@published" data-word-count="100"&gt;The parasite-cleanse trend could be a product of simple fear — a collective psychological response to a world that feels like it’s invading us. We’re told constantly that our bodies are full of things we can’t see: forever chemicals, microplastics, phthalates, Bisphenol A, mercury, lead. We don’t know where our food comes from; it just shows up in the grocery store in a way that feels both mundane and sinister. Who touched it on its way there? &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; touched it? I ask Griffin what he thinks about it all. What would possess someone to believe they were crawling with worms?&lt;/p&gt;

Multivitamins have quietly become part of our daily lives and rituals, as they’re an easy way to get one’s fill of important vitamins to support their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this habit isn’t for no reason at all — multivitamins do provide a combination of essential vitamins and minerals to fill nutritional gaps when diet alone isn't enough, acting as "nutritional insurance" for overall health, energy, and immune support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top Supplements for Men's Health Over 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do these pills really make a difference — or are we all popping them for nothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve often asked this ourselves when we haven’t gotten visible results despite sticking to our routine. But no more — new research from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/multivitamins-improve-memory-and-slow-cognitive-aging" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; gives clearer, evidence-based answers. The findings of the research suggest that daily multivitamins are not a universal “health fix,” but they may offer real benefits in specific groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who all fall in those groups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the new research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recently published set of studies under the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS), researchers analyzed data from over 5,000 older adults and found evidence that a daily multivitamin may help slow cognitive aging and preserve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the COSMOS-Clinic subcohort — 573 participants who underwent detailed in-person cognitive assessments over two years — showed modest but statistically significant benefits in global cognition and episodic memory for those taking multivitamins compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combining results with two other arms of the trial (which used telephone- and web-based cognitive testing), the meta-analysis confirmed consistent benefits across all three studies. On average, daily multivitamin use was associated with a “slowing” of cognitive aging by around two years compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So what does that mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, older individuals who took a multivitamin performed slightly better on memory tests and had a slower decline in overall cognition over a period of 2–3 years compared to those taking a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts involved in the study note that the findings are “exciting,” suggesting a multivitamin could be an accessible, affordable way to support brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits the most from multivitamins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the new findings of the aforementioned study, multivitamins appear most useful for older adults, particularly those whose diets may be lacking or whose bodies might not absorb nutrients as efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/daily-multivitamin-may-improve-memory-in-older-adults/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;earlier trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 3,500 adults aged over 60 found memory improvements after a year of daily multivitamin use. The multivitamin effect was strongest among the participants with existing cardiovascular disease, which implied that underlying health conditions or nutritional deficits may make the supplement more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, experts suggest that in older age, factors like reduced absorption, less varied diet, or underlying health concerns may contribute to mild micronutrient deficiencies, which might make supplements even more useful than for younger, healthy adults eating balanced diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, multivitamins are likely to help when there’s a genuine need — primarily age-related or diet-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily, if you are 60 or older, or worried about memory or cognitive aging, especially if you don’t eat a very balanced diet, a daily multivitamin could offer small but meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, if your diet is already rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and essential nutrients, the added benefit of a multivitamin may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: think of multivitamins as a supplement instead of treating them as a substitute. Rather, focus first on diet quality, physical activity, mental stimulation, and overall healthy living. However, if you decide to take multivitamins, make sure to choose a well-balanced supplement (covering essential vitamins and minerals), and consult a healthcare professional beforehand — especially if you have existing health conditions or take other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>流感来得早，病例比去年增加了五倍-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/flu-comes-early-and-hits-hard-with-five-times-more-cases-than-last-year/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Amid a sharp rise in flu cases around the country that has seen &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/six-year-old-boy-dies-of-flu-complications-in-second-case-this-week/"&gt;three children die&lt;/a&gt; from complications of the disease, the Health Ministry’s Epidemic Control Team called an emergency meeting late Sunday night to discuss possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of the flu in Israel has started earlier this year, and is five times greater than during the same period last year, the Ynet news site reported, citing figures from Maccabi Healthcare Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, about 25 percent of PCR samples for respiratory viruses tested positive for Influenza A, compared to 5% last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The report said that in the week ending November 29, the Center for Disease Control recorded 394 new Influenza A cases in 14 hospitals. Children accounted for 163 of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, two babies were hospitalized in critical condition at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, with one being ventilated. At Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center, a toddler was also placed on a life-support system due to complications from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Flu comes early and hits hard, with five times more cases than last year"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The report also noted a steep rise in Influenza A among preschool-age children (ages 3 to 6) in November, with 59% of those tested for respiratory viruses found testing positive for that strain of the flu. Among school-age children (ages 6 to 18), about 50% of tests were positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Influenza A(H3N2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant subtype of this year’s influenza is A(H3N2). Infected people may experience symptoms such as fever, coughing, and sore throat, similar to those of other types of flu; however, A(H3N2) strains can lead to more severe respiratory problems and be fatal in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization reported that Influenza A continues to increase worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A woman gets her flu vaccine shot on September 5, 2023. (Clalit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, less than 15% of people in Israeli healthcare funds have been vaccinated against seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the children who died of the flu over the past two weeks had not received flu vaccinations, while one had received a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Prof. Ariel Tenenbaum, head of Hadassah’s pediatric department, urged people to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine will prevent children from being in a life-threatening condition,” Tenenbaum said.&lt;/p&gt;

It beats in rhythm with the world around us.” Here’s an exclusive interview:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this recognition from the American Heart Association mean to you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a great privilege, a very distinguished recognition of the work. To be selected amongst thousands of cardiologists every year is a unique privilege. I'm delighted, but equally delighted for what this means for the area of science that I'm involved in. It recognizes the work linked to science research, but also to translational research- the underpinning of whatever we do in cardiology. It's evidence-based. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The recognition is really an acknowledgment of the science that goes into decision making in the area of cardiology and a link between the work that I've done in the environment space.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;A lot of it is underpinned by the fact that we use research methodology to succumb to conclusions about the world around us, as well as the world within us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can you elaborate on the impact of environmental risk factors, specifically air pollution on cardiovascular diseases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is the second leading cause of global mortality right after hypertension which is the leading cause. It doesn't include any other environmental variable. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Just the math of this means that if you add together all the known knowns, and we know very little about environmental risk factors, then that's a part of it that really should be a clarion call for waking up, particularly in India, which is in the crosshairs of multiple environmental exposures.&lt;/span&gt; Air pollution is singularly the most important problem that we currently face and are going to face in the years to come. More than 60% of deaths attributable to air pollution are those that have led to cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When examined in that lens of why this is important for the subcontinent, it is a massive and a very important actionable area of health. Everyone’s entitled to good, clean air, clean water, and clean food. There should be an unmitigated attempt to curb exposure to air pollution, particularly in vulnerable communities, such as children. Early exposure during childhood causes permanent damage to your lung capacity or sets you up for future problems. Since it’s not a problem that individuals can solve alone, it's changes at policy and governmental level that are vital. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In light of the fact that this is such a humongous human tragedy, there needs to be a no-tolerance policy, and all hands on deck in terms of solving the problem.&lt;/span&gt; Also, air pollution costs India enormously. The economic ramifications in terms of sick days, hospitalisations and deaths are massive on a productivity frontier too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s your involvement at policy level?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I have helped position the US policy as part of the committee called the scientific advisory committee (SAC) and the Environmental Protection Agency, which formulates climate policy.&lt;/span&gt; I collaborate with researchers to try to come up with useful experiments or quasi-natural experiments that could inform or guide policy. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I would be delighted to be engaged in any capacity with the Indian government, as I care deeply about the environment, particularly in parts of the world where policy actions or changes could have a significant impact on population health.&lt;/span&gt; The biggest point of convergence that shouldn't take any convincing for everybody is children's health. I hope that children's health is a rallying cry for people to unite in their opposition to anything detrimental to kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the most prevalent risk factors of CVD?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading cause of mortality and death worldwide is hypertension. Cardiovascular diseases have overtaken cancers as the leading cause of global mortality. One of the reasons for that is a growing epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. India, unfortunately, is the grand center for diabetes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is because of an incredible transition, both in terms of transitioning to nutrient heavy foods, changes in dietary patterns, changes in physical activity, densely populated cities that provide little room for recreation, lack of exercise, lack of education, and a profound shift and appetite, and the way people eat.&lt;/span&gt; It's just a massive problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US is no different. We are seeing a tsunami of obesity and diabetes. Smoking rates have gone down, but there's been an uptick in practices like vaping. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and elevation in LDL cholesterol, are driving heart disease globally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to reduce CVD and live long with a healthy heart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To stem or reduce cardiovascular disease prevalence, there needs to be paid to address not just the risk factors, but also primordial prevention- referring to an area where you don't allow these risk factors to begin in the first place.&lt;/span&gt; For example, to prevent the onset of hypertension or diabetes. And that really begins at the kindergarten level with education. It should be a huge priority from childhood. Also, educating families and how they feed their kids, what they consume in school and physical activity. You build good habits like physical exercises in school. It should be mandatory. People should understand that good food is about intelligent choices. Like a transition from eating a carbohydrate-rich diet to a protein rich diet. That should be the real focus because in the long run, that's the most cost effective way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association has a big push on primordial prevention. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you sleep well, do good physical activity, don't smoke, control hypertension, eat a good diet and are not obese- that should give you a fairly good lifespan and healthspan.&lt;/span&gt; It’s a good recipe for longevity in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Any next generation therapies for CVD and any innovative approaches for imaging.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;We are at a very interesting crossroads in medicine- at a confluence of artificial intelligence and genetic technologies, which are really going to redefine the era of medicine.&lt;/span&gt; Diseases that would have, essentially, relegated you to premature death, with no options are now becoming curable. There are some cardiac conditions, like amyloidosis that can now be completely solved. But these are expensive treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a larger population perspective, the previous century practices work best like eating less, walking more, and eating more plant based foods. I would say, these are the three fundamental requisites for good cardiovascular health. Prevent yourself from getting to be a diabetic, obese, and hypertensive. These are all connected risk factors that can be solved by healthy dietary practices and exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to offset the genetic predisposition that South Asians face?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetically speaking we are all the same. The genome is 99.5% or more similar. What's different is the genetic environment interactions-meaning the epigenomic responses or the responses to environmental triggers. For instance, if a South Asian is exposed to a high fat diet, they respond very differently than somebody in Europe or China. This is the epigenomic framework, where genes are expressed differently based on the environment you are placed in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anything that you might like to add on the young people, getting more cardiovascular diseases than was earlier seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s very tragic and not based on traditional risk factors. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is where I think there should be a lot of attention on setting up a large registry of such patients where we are able to collect tissue samples, bio-bank specimens, and a very detailed history on patients.&lt;/span&gt; I believe that environmental exposures of these patients might be very important. What might be singularly different about these patients might be an increase in environmental exposures. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;There are many parts of India, as well as in North America, that have high exposure to lead, cadmium, arsenic, and other toxic metals, as well as chemicals and large amounts of plastic, which are ubiquitous and all around you.&lt;/span&gt; This is compounded by profound, high levels of air pollution. In conjunction with other risk factors, this can be very dangerous. It's a huge problem, very unbelievably disturbing. When you're at the peak of your livelihood, it’s medically and economically catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The duvet is pulled neatly into place, the pillows are arranged with care, and the perfectly made bed becomes a symbol of order and discipline. Across generations, this simple act has been encouraged as a marker of responsibility, productivity, and self-control. From military training to parenting advice and bestselling self-help books, making the bed has been framed as a small but meaningful accomplishment that sets the tone for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, emerging research suggests that this universally accepted habit may be hiding an unexpected drawback. While it appears harmless and even beneficial, it could be creating conditions that quietly undermine your respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

With more people spending extended time at home, conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinus issues are increasingly being linked to pollutants and allergens inside the home. Bedrooms, where people spend roughly a third of their lives, are especially important in this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the traditional practice of making the bed every morning takes an unexpected turn. A growing body of scientific evidence highlights how tightly made bedding may be fostering an environment ideal for dust mite survival. A widely discussed study conducted at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/about/news/messy-bedroom-could-spell-end-for-creepy-crawlies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kingston University in the United Kingdom &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;revealed that leaving your bed unmade during the day could significantly reduce dust mite populations. Led by environmental building scientist Dr Stephen Pretlove, the research examined how heat and moisture trapped in bedding influence dust mite growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A freshly made bed traps the warmth and humidity generated during sleep. These conditions allow dust mites, which feed on dead skin cells, to thrive. When the bed is left unmade, with sheets exposed to airflow and natural evaporation, moisture levels fall and the microclimate becomes less favourable for mite survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Pretlove noted, allowing a bed to remain open during the day helps moisture evaporate from the mattress and bedding materials. This creates an environment that disrupts dust mite activity and reduces their ability to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why dust mites pose a serious health concern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dust mites are among the most common indoor allergens worldwide. Although invisible to the naked eye, their waste particles can trigger a variety of allergic reactions. Symptoms may range from mild nasal irritation and sneezing to more significant respiratory issues, particularly in people with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/dust-mites" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, bedding and pillows are some of the most concentrated sources of dust mite allergens in the home. An average bed may host up to 1.5 million mites, creating a continual source of allergen exposure night after night. Reducing dust mite levels is therefore crucial for households with asthma sufferers, young children, older adults, or individuals with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden link between bed-making habits and dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that a tidy bed equates to a cleaner sleeping environment. In reality, the opposite may be true. When you sleep, your body releases moisture through sweat and respiration. The average adult emits roughly one litre of fluid each night. If you immediately make the bed in the morning, this moisture becomes trapped under layers of sheets, blankets, and duvets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With limited ventilation, particularly during colder months when windows remain closed, this trapped moisture creates a warm and humid microclimate ideal for dust mite survival and reproduction. Indoor heating systems further complicate the issue by drying the air outside the bedding while leaving the inside warm and insulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies, including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasise the importance of reducing humidity and improving airflow to control indoor allergens. However, few people consider how their bed-making routine influences these environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bed-making tips that help control dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts do not suggest abandoning cleanliness or household routines. Instead, they recommend a more thoughtful approach to bed-making. Rather than immediately arranging your bedding after waking, allow the sheets and mattress to air out for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull back the duvet, open the windows if possible, and leave the bed exposed to moving air. This helps disperse moisture, lowers humidity, and reduces the hospitable environment that dust mites rely on. Of course, this practice should complement other hygienic habits such as washing bedding every one to two weeks in hot water, vacuuming the mattress regularly, and using dust-mite-resistant covers on pillows and mattresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing importance of indoor air quality in multi use bedrooms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern lifestyles have blurred the boundaries between living, working, and sleeping spaces. With more people using bedrooms for multiple activities, the quality of the indoor environment matters more than ever. Allowing your bed to breathe is a low-cost, practical step that can improve air quality and reduce allergen levels. It is not about rejecting cleanliness but about adapting an old habit to align with new scientific understanding. The tradition of making the bed every morning has been deeply ingrained for generations. Yet as research continues to highlight the importance of indoor air quality, small adjustments to this habit could have meaningful benefits for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bed unmade for a few hours allows natural airflow to do what it does best. It dries the bedding, disrupts the activity of dust mites, and creates a healthier sleeping environment. By rethinking this everyday ritual, you may be reducing an invisible risk that has quietly affected millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPQlZEVkE0c20yNi1HS3FIS2JJVEY2Y0tPZWEtY2dpR1NhQ1FtS2xVTVQ4UGMzMWk4cVRpeWRiY2hha3htc1NiM0VoY2dyUGZyMmZ2ekQ4ajFEU3VTNEZINnh4SXEwcHdHZktuSmxqZE9kS2I3OUFKdHJEWndYVVdmemZITk1WUUpvck45V0M2dEg1akRxYm4tZUdhLUZsNW43cDhkRlpQOHFyLTRLYWlnMzdQSV83U3JvTkdBc0x5b2FHQlV6QlJqZGRTSmV0d1JvNF84c0w0MG4wSG9GR0U1N0RpaFk5aEZRR3lKb2t6NzNzdEh1UHJ2Y1BPcVVvMjVZQWZEakR3VldJbXBRam50TEUydWRJSno4eG5lMHBUYnVkZ9IBpwJBVV95cUxNd3BJTlhBY0s1SEF4SFBEQnNkUVNpclNLT3ZSM2tUY2NRVm4tN0lYWERKbk1tbEx0eDkxUUx4Y3llRURPdjlQaVR6T01kZ1RjajdQNGU1aWxsaTR0LUF1dzg4RW1IWVpLcVZ0ODJ2ajRlcDIzbldlTjZ3RktQT3hCejl1V0J5VkRkWjYzTnRnNlgzcVpTaU50NzBpdjBBMHhsalQtTnJIUjFPMzlFOTI4Skh0cldKN0N4SDFlZ3F4WTU2ckdEWjB5RmVacTFzYXljN1lyaG9hZThRczFFYXV4UWpYRFg3SU9ZeVNGZGdzOUhkTVdPU1NVNFRpTEh3eTVYSjZ3aWNySWNOT1hzOUhDWGVmRFFYc0RuRGo3dlAtMkc2eDJSd044</guid></item><item><title>人类是为大自然而生，而不是为现代生活而生- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251207031335.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A new analysis by evolutionary anthropologists Colin Shaw (University of Zurich) and Daniel Longman (Loughborough University) argues that the modern world has developed faster than human biology can adapt. Their work proposes that chronic stress and many widespread health concerns stem from a fundamental mismatch between our nature-shaped physiology and the highly industrialized environments most people live in today.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, humans evolved to meet the physical and psychological demands of hunter-gatherer life, which required frequent movement, short bursts of intense stress and daily exposure to natural settings. Industrialization has altered these conditions within only a few centuries by adding noise, air and light pollution, microplastics, pesticides, continuous sensory input, artificial lighting, processed foods and long periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our ancestral environments, we were well adapted to deal with acute stress to evade or confront predators," says Colin Shaw, who leads the Human Evolutionary EcoPhysiology (HEEP) research group with Daniel Longman. "The lion would come around occasionally, and you had to be ready to defend yourself -- or run. The key is that the lion goes away again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern stressors such as traffic, workplace pressure, social media and persistent noise activate the same biological pathways that once helped humans survive predators. Unlike the rapid resolution our ancestors experienced, these stressors rarely subside. "Our body reacts as though all these stressors were lions," Longman explains. "Whether it's a difficult discussion with your boss or traffic noise, your stress response system is still the same as if you were facing lion after lion. As a result, you have a very powerful response from your nervous system, but no recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrialization and Its Impact on Health and Reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their review, Shaw and Longman evaluate research suggesting that the shift toward industrial and urban living is reducing human evolutionary fitness. Evolutionary success depends on both survival and reproduction, and the authors argue that both have been negatively influenced since industrialization began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They highlight falling fertility rates across much of the world and increasing rates of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as evidence that modern environments are placing stress on human biology. "There's a paradox where, on the one hand, we've created tremendous wealth, comfort and healthcare for a lot of people on the planet," Shaw says, "but on the other hand, some of these industrial achievements are having detrimental effects on our immune, cognitive, physical and reproductive functions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most studied examples is the steady decline in sperm count and sperm motility observed since the 1950s. Shaw notes that these trends appear to be linked to environmental exposures. "This is believed to be tied to pesticides and herbicides in food, but also to microplastics," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for Solutions That Support Human Wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological and environmental conditions continue to change far more rapidly than biological evolution can respond to. "Biological adaptation is very slow. Longer-term genetic adaptations are multigenerational -- tens to hundreds of thousands of years," Shaw says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this means the mismatch between human physiology and modern living conditions will not correct itself through natural evolutionary processes. Instead, they argue that societies must take active steps to reduce these pressures by strengthening connections to nature and creating healthier, more sustainable environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing this mismatch requires both cultural and environmental changes. Shaw suggests treating nature as a crucial component of public health and protecting or restoring landscapes that resemble those in which humans originally evolved. He also advocates for rethinking city design to better align with human physiology and reduce harmful exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research can identify which stimuli most affect blood pressure, heart rate or immune function, for example, and pass that knowledge on to decision-makers," Shaw says. "We need to get our cities right -- and at the same time regenerate, value and spend more time in natural spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Photo: Kajsa Göransson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text-image__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” says &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/people/torkel-klingberg" data-entity-type="external"&gt;Torkel Klingberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/neuro" data-entity-type="external"&gt;Department of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, Karolinska Institutet. “Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Significance at population level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was not influenced by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards ADHD. Additionally, children who already had symptoms of inattentiveness did not start to use social media more, which suggests that the association leads from use to symptoms and not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no increase in hyperactive/impulsive behaviour. The effect on concentration was small at the individual level. At a population level, however, it could have a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” says Professor Klingberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Well-informed decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that the results do not imply that all children who use social media develop concentration difficulties, but there is reason to discuss age limits and platform design. In the study, the average time spent on social media rose from approximately 30 minutes a day for 9-year-olds to 2.5 hours for 13-year-olds, despite the fact that many platforms set their minimum age requirement at 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Karolinska Institutet</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:05:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=""

the world, could lead to the world's next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The death also comes as bird flu was detected in an Australian external territory for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;European health authorities warned this month that governments should step up efforts to combat bird flu

among wild birds and poultry have been detected in at least 26 European countries, four times higher than a year ago and the highest level since 2016, raising the risk that the virus could spill over into people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some forms of bird flu, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a

infections are rare and typically occur in cases who have been in close contact with sick birds and livestock. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some experts say it's becoming more likely that the bird flu virus could become the next pandemic, while others agree its possible but say the probability is "very low". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;What do we know about bird flu pathogens?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from the University of South Australia, said H5N5, like the first strain detected in humans in Hong Kong in 1997, H5N1, was highly infectious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The one that's really causing worry at the moment is the H5N1, which is going around the world, not only killing off millions of wild birds and domestic birds, but it's also affecting mammals all around the world," he told SBS News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These are all what we call highly pathogenic avian flu, basically, there's two types of bird flu, there's bird flu, which is quite mild and basically doesn't kill off the wild birds, which is called low pathogenic avian flu, then there's highly pathogenic, and both H5N5 and H5N1 are highly pathogenic," Esterman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the early Hong Kong human transmission cases, there have been more than a dozen strains, with cases flaring in different parts of the world at different times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are almost 1,000 recorded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiLink-root

being transmitted to humans, with at least 476 human deaths recorded since 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 11 deaths from bird flu between January and August; these were in Cambodia, India and Mexico.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;A changing virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said like the coronavirus, the avian flu virus continued to morph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The H and the N stand for proteins that spike out from the flu," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What happens is, every year they tend to change a little bit, and every few years they have a major change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outbreaks of other strains, including H7 subtypes, have occurred on poultry farms in some eastern states in recent years and have been eradicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists came across H5N5 in animals around 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div

variant poses, but Esterman said the fact that H5N1 had such a high mortality rate for humans, about 48 per cent, meant any spread of avian flu variants to humans was "a big worry".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In November, the federal government confirmed the H5N1 strain had been detected for the first time on remote Heard Island, 4,000km south-west of Perth and 1,700km north of Antarctica.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;How humans catch bird flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the recent cases of bird flu have been in the

virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the virus is also in wild birds, humans most often catch it from either domestic birds or from cattle and dairy cows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Usually it's a dead animal, and you know, they'll touch a dead animal, but I suppose they can pick it up from just droppings on the ground," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said most of the people who contracted the virus either worked in the dairy or poultry industries or were associated with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said while it was possible for the virus to be passed from human to human, there was little to no evidence of its spread that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;div itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="8"

data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;Avian flu could arrive in Australia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cassandra Berry, a professor of immunology at Murdoch University, said the eventual arrival of H5 variants of bird flu into Australia was inevitable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are now surrounded by the virus," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Australia and Antarctica were the only continents free of bird flu in the world, but that changed a few years ago, with virus outbreaks being observed in Antarctica and surrounding islands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Even the expedition leaders on my recent trip to the Antarctic peninsula earlier this year remarked on the low sightings of crab-eater seals and skuas, likely decimated by a highly pathogenic bird flu strain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Berry said if the virus jumped into animal species in Australia, culling and ring vaccination, in which populations of animals surrounding the confirmed cases were vaccinated, would be the preferred control measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"However, neighbouring countries have been mass vaccinating their poultry to protect flocks, industry and food supply," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In the meantime, virus surveillance is the key biosecurity measure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text

there was potential for the bird flu to become a pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A pandemic is always on the cards," Berry said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said one reason the H5 strains pose such a risk to humans is that "it's got such a high mortality rate".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"All the people who've been infected with the H5N1 strain over the last 20 years, half of them have died, so it's nasty," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Griffin said while there were a lot of variables to consider, if bird flu started spreading between humans, he estimated it'd take just days to "really spread all around the world".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said the fact "we're not seeing very many human cases, and seeing very rare, if any, human-to-human spread of these, so at the moment," was reassuring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, he said a growing number of bird species and other animals were becoming affected and the virus was increasing its geographical spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So it has the makings for a potentially significant situation, if that ability to be transmitted to and between humans increases," Griffin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said monitoring animal populations was vital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We need to be monitoring for the potential changes that might give these flus the ability to be more transmissible in humans, and we need to, you know, make sure that surveillance continues, but also that we're preparing for if it does make its way into humans, for how we'd respond to that," Griffin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said while there was a vaccine for H5N1, there was not currently a vaccine for H5N5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"With vaccine technology more broadly, we are in a fortunate position that we can adapt our vaccines potentially more quickly, but flu vaccines and the traditional platform do take quite a bit of time to manufacture," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gregorio Torres, head of the Science Department at the World Organisation for Animal Health, told the Reuters news agency the risk of a human pandemic developing from the bird flu virus remains low,.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We need to be prepared to respond early enough. But for the time being, you can happily walk in the forest, eat chicken and eggs and enjoy your life," he said. "The pandemic risk is a possibility. But in terms of probability, it's still very low."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government committed an additional $95 million to both protecting Australia from and preparing the country for the outbreak of bird flu in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The funding has gone towards strengthening national biosecurity response capability, surveillance and public health preparedness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SBS Australia</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 03:07:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPei1qSnY1ODJxck1RUm5JSDRkOTh6TWtZQWI2eXVSZy10OVhZUHM3VVFTVVBMVmdhbDR5VUJBejBnN2xxUHdoZS0wOGIwd2JkZUNzZGxoQUcycFBwVHN3T01XS0pfcElmeE9lX2RlZ0FCOG9TY2lIc0k3TVRzV2NwaUdfcFR4VXRKMTh3Mko5ejFyZ2RFLVRZ</guid></item><item><title>降低血压：这种简单的睡前习惯可以帮助改善心脏健康和整体健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lower-your-blood-pressure-this-simple-bedtime-habit-could-help-improve-heart-health-and-overall-wellness/articleshow/125813687.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects nearly half of adults in the United States and increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious cardiovascular problems. While medications, a healthy diet, and regular exercise are commonly recommended to manage blood pressure, recent research highlights the importance of sleep timing. Going to bed at the same time every night can help regulate the body’s internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, which controls sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. A consistent bedtime supports the natural nightly dip in blood pressure, reduces stress on the heart, and can even enhance the effectiveness of existing hypertension treatments. Maintaining this simple habit is an easy and low-cost strategy for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding blood pressure and why it matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries and is recorded as two numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diastolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries between heartbeats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure is considered below 120/80 mmHg. Readings above 130/80 mmHg indicate hypertension, and readings above 180/120 mmHg require urgent medical attention. Hypertension often develops without symptoms, making it essential to monitor regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of circadian rhythm in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian rhythm is the body’s internal clock, which regulates sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. Blood pressure naturally dips during sleep: a process called nocturnal dipping. Disruptions to sleep patterns, such as going to bed at inconsistent times, can interfere with this natural dip and contribute to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sustained high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of diabetes and obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher chances of heart attacks and strokes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a regular bedtime strengthens the circadian rhythm, helping the body regulate blood pressure more effectively.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating lots of added sugar at night can make it harder to fall and stay asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar spikes before bed can mess with hormones that help your body get sleepy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose snacks with protein, fiber and healthy fats to keep blood sugar steady for better sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most Americans already consume &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291176/what-happens-when-you-consume-too-much-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;too much added sugar&lt;/a&gt;—to the tune of about 17 teaspoons per day—which is linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and poor sleep.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When foods high in added sugar are eaten close to bedtime, they can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, making it harder to fall and stay asleep. Not all sugar is created equal, though. “Naturally occurring sugars are found in whole foods that also provide fiber, vitamins and minerals, while added sugars are often found in more refined, ultra-processed foods,” says&lt;a href="https://wellnessbyval.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Val Warner, M.S., RD, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “Consuming too much added sugar is what’s linked to negative health outcomes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand how eating sugar in the evening affects sleep—and what to reach for instead—we spoke with registered dietitians to break down the science and share practical tips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-sugar-can-impact-your-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Sugar Can Impact Your Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat foods high in added sugar—like candy or baked goods—your blood sugar rises and your body releases insulin to move that glucose into your cells for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That process is completely normal. But when blood sugar rises sharply, particularly in the evening, it can throw off the delicate balance of hormones that help regulate your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep-wake cycle&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High amounts of added sugar can cause a rapid spike in blood glucose, triggering the release of insulin to bring levels back down,” explains Warner. If levels drop quickly afterward, your body may release hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to bring them back up—leaving you feeling alert when you’d rather be asleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When cortisol stays high at night, it can delay the natural rise in melatonin that signals your body it’s time to sleep,” says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. This mismatch between cortisol and melatonin can make it more difficult to relax and fall asleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These blood-sugar fluctuations can also affect how deeply and how long you sleep. Studies show that diets high in added sugar are linked to shorter sleep duration and more frequent nighttime awakenings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rapid rises and dips in glucose may also disrupt REM sleep—the stage that supports memory, learning and emotional regulation—and reduce time spent in deep, restorative sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why your evening sweet tooth can sometimes lead to a night of tossing and turning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-8-pm-be-the-cutoff-time-for-added-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Should 8 P.M. Be the “Cutoff Time” for Added Sugar?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s nothing magical about the clock striking 8 p.m., the timing of your last meal or snack can influence how your body handles sugar—and how well you sleep afterward. Our metabolism follows a circadian rhythm, meaning that we process and use energy differently at different times of day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Timing matters when it comes to thinking about your sugar intake,” says &lt;a href="http://themetabolicdietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny Finke, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. As the day winds down, digestion slows and insulin sensitivity decreases, making it harder for the body to manage large amounts of sugar.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Ideally, the last meal of the day is eaten two to three hours before bed, as this allows time for digestion and processing of the sugars or carbohydrates present in the meal,” Finke adds. “This spacing supports steadier blood sugar as melatonin levels rise, and it helps support optimal sleep quality,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, there’s no one-size-fits-all “sugar curfew.” The key is to tune in to your body’s cues—if you tend to feel wired or wake frequently after a nighttime dessert, it may help to enjoy it earlier in the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-dietitians-say-to-eat-instead"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Dietitians Say to Eat Instead &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re truly hungry before bed, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-dont-eat-11814208" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping food&lt;/a&gt; altogether isn’t the answer—going to sleep hungry can make it harder to drift off and stay asleep. Instead, Warner recommends a snack that combines protein, healthy fats, fiber and complex carbohydrates to help keep blood sugar steady. This balance helps slow digestion and prevents the sharp rises and dips that can interfere with deep, restorative sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finke recommends our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252837/nut-berry-parfait/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nut &amp;amp; Berry Parfait&lt;/a&gt; for a mix of protein, fiber and healthy fats. She suggests swapping the berries for frozen tart cherries, as they are associated with improved sleep quality and duration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians also recommend our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; as a fiber- and protein-rich option that can help keep blood sugar steady and support better sleep. Chia seeds also provide magnesium and calcium, nutrients that play a role in converting tryptophan to serotonin, a precursor to melatonin. Make it with dairy milk or a calcium-fortified nondairy milk, then top with fruit and nuts for a balanced combination of carbs, healthy fats and sleep-supporting nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s less about cutting out sweets entirely and more about how you enjoy them. “It’s all about pairing the right foods, not about restriction,” Warner encourages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to avoid dessert altogether for better sleep. Thankfully, it’s less about cutting out sweets entirely and more about how you enjoy them. If you want something sweet before bed, opt for foods that contain naturally occurring sugars and enjoy them with foods that contain fiber, protein and healthy fats. Balanced snacks that support stable blood sugar also help you sleep better. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple watches, Garmin watches, Fitbit watches, the Strava app … there are endless ways to track miles walked, calories burned, and steps taken. Not only that, but there’s been a big push to track those measures every time — and it may be hurting your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The obsession with self-tracking of health metrics with wearables can increase anxiety and cause you to ignore what your body is telling you,” said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/michael-swartzon/869766" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Swartzon&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine physician at Baptist Health Orthopedic Care. “The raw data can lead to emotional stress when your body is just going through normal biological variations, probably the opposite of your goal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://freespira.com/leadership_team/robert-cuyler-ph-d/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robert Cuyler&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral health expert, whether health tracking is “healthy” is about when and how much you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The availability of tech-mediated health data is interesting and useful for those who use these tools (smartwatches, rings, etc.) in moderation and for specific purposes, with some guidance by evidence,” he said. “However, health tracking ... can become excessive, fueling bodily hypervigilance and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Swartzon encouraged people to focus on the basics: fitting some physical exercise into their day, eating a wide variety of foods, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and listening to their body. All that other data isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Ashley, 35, told the outlet she made sure Tori got plenty of rest and continued to monitor her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Tori's fever broke after a few days, Ashley believed she was on the mend. "Then suddenly, she started complaining of intense pain in both legs," the mom recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pain began in Tori's thighs before moving down to her calves. As she was still recovering from the flu, Ashley assumed the leg pain was "just normal soreness" from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother taking a child's temperature (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But soon, the pain became so intense that Tori complained of being unable to stand, saying "her legs felt too weak to support her," Ashley told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She took Tori to a walk-in clinic, but doctors “didn’t seem concerned" and advised Ashley to take her daughter home and allow her to continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next morning, however, Tori attempted to get out of bed and "took one step and dropped straight to the ground because the pain was so unbearable when she put pressure on her feet," her mom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That was the moment I knew this was something serious,” Ashley recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Child in hospital (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashley took Tori to the emergency room, where she underwent testing, including bloodwork and a urinalysis. Tori was then diagnosed with benign acute childhood myositis (BACM), a rare disease that is "characterized by localized muscular pain (especially in the calves) that typically follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection," according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12454055/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The illness typically lasts for a brief period of time, usually up to 1 week," the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250949/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; said, noting, "Since many clinicians are unfamiliar with BACM, it is often misdiagnosed and interpreted as a more severe and complex disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Tori's case, the 9-year-old fully recovered — and was able to walk normally again — after a week in the hospital, where she was closely monitored and administered IV fluids and pain medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But her mom told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that her daughter's BACM diagnosis came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This completely caught me off guard," she said. "I had never even heard of this kind of complication from the flu before. It was scary and very unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, Ashley is warning other parents about the rare complication.

I'm sharing our story so other parents can know what to watch for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;, Ashley added, “Listen to your kids when they say something hurts, even if it seems unusual.

    &lt;p&gt;When people think of gym goers using steroids, the picture that comes to mind is often of a man &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"&gt;pumping iron, like Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, or modern day shirtless masculinity &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/from-the-liver-king-to-ultramarathons-fitness-influencers-are-glorifying-extreme-masculinity-where-pain-is-the-point-256817"&gt;influencers like “the Liver King”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the image is changing. Women now represent a growing share of people who use steroids. And so harm minimisation efforts, currently targeted at men, will need to change too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DL3GLMAxuMG","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows women are increasingly represented among steroid-using communities, even though precise long-term trend data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;2024 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of international studies found about 4% of adult women had used anabolic steroids at least once, up from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.01.009"&gt;1.6% in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2024/08/28/risks-faced-by-women-using-anabolic-steroids-in-australia"&gt;Among women bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 17% – around one in six – report using steroids, and rates among women in strength sports or recreational lifting communities are also markedly higher than in the general woman population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging evidence suggests the gender profile of steroid use is shifting, even if precise historical rates are not available to confirm the exact scale of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we don’t have robust national statistics for Australia, data show &lt;a href="https://www.acic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-10/illicit_drug_data_report_2020-21_forweb.pdf"&gt;the weight of steroids seized nationally&lt;/a&gt; increased 1,372% between 2011-12 and 2020-21 (from 33.7 kilograms to 496.8kg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend almost &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;certainly mirrors what’s happening overseas&lt;/a&gt;: continued, escalating growth of the bodybuilding and fitness communities, including among women in amateur strength sports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boom in women’s &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-03/women-weightlifting-no-longer-invisible-empowering-women-all-age/105945008"&gt;strength training and weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; since 2021 will benefit the physical and mental health of most who partake in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the simultaneous increase in steroid use may be cause for concern without effective harm reduction via education, health promotion and health services engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="TiktokEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@larrywheels/video/7389447108404776234"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3 reasons more women are using them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex but three stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/physical-activity/strengthening-activities-among-australian-adults/contents/summary"&gt;the rise of strength sports&lt;/a&gt;. Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666337625000162"&gt;participation in powerlifting, weightlifting and bodybuilding has grown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/women-strength-training-shredded-at-gym-for-health/103376798"&gt;rapidly in Australia &lt;/a&gt;since the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sports have opened up new spaces for women to feel strong, confident and physically capable. But they also expose women to online communities where performance-enhancing drugs are normalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Second, the influence of social media. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are filled with “fitfluencers” showcasing dramatic transformations. Many of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;women are seeking the “perfect body”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some openly promote steroid cycles and other chemical shortcuts. Women who follow these influencers – often for training or nutrition advice – can end up in online spaces where performance-enhancing drugs are normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;

      &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/get-big-or-die-trying-social-media-is-driving-mens-use-of-steroids-heres-how-to-mitigate-the-risks-253110"&gt;Get big or die trying: social media is driving men's use of steroids. Here's how to mitigate the risks&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Third, many women are being encouraged or “brought into” performance-enhancing drugs use by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research from Australia and Scandinavia shows women often start using steroids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395920302164?via%3Dihub"&gt;through male friends, partners or coaches&lt;/a&gt;, who may position these drugs as necessary for progress or competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, taking any performance- or image-enhancing drug is not without risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The dangers are real&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While steroids carry risks for everyone, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6371806/"&gt;women may face unique and irreversible side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102876"&gt;These include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facial and body hair growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deepening of the voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;menstrual changes or infertility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breast tissue reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acne and hair loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clitoral enlargement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;severe mood changes, including anxiety and irritability, among other symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond these risks, emerging Australian research shows another danger: many underground steroid products &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/pumped-up-with-poison-new-research-shows-many-anabolic-steroids-contain-toxic-metals-261470"&gt;contain toxic contaminants&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.70007"&gt;such as lead, arsenic and cadmium&lt;/a&gt; – substances linked to cancer, organ damage and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest long-term risks are the ones people rarely talk about: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797160/"&gt;heart disease, stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2025.2460986"&gt;liver damage&lt;/a&gt; and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with women who use steroids show many are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0091450924125600"&gt;less informed than men about these dangers&lt;/a&gt;, often because the research has historically focused on male use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of stigma. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;Women report&lt;/a&gt; being judged more harshly than men when seeking medical help and some avoid health services entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves them more vulnerable to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do we turn this trend around?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policing steroid use in isolation won’t work. Nor will repeating the old message that women should simply “just say no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests three promising approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better health promotion education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that actually speaks to women. Most steroid information online is written for men, by men. Health agencies need to produce clear, accessible, women’s resources &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci9040055"&gt;that explain risks honestly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;without shame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/28355245.2024.2350155"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Meeting women where they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Social media is where many women learn about these drugs, so it should also be where they see accurate information. This may include partnering with credible fitness influencers – especially women – who can explain risks, promote safer training practices and counter misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reducing stigma in healthcare.&lt;/strong&gt; Women who use steroids may avoid doctors because they fear judgement. Training clinicians to respond without moralising – the same way we approach other drug-related issues – would make it easier for women to seek support early.&lt;/p&gt;

These traditional methods, although widely used, can cause minor pain, skin irritation, or bruising, and their frequency can reduce adherence. Advances in optical sensing technologies are now offering alternatives that allow you to monitor glucose continuously without breaking the skin. One particularly promising technique is band-pass Raman spectroscopy, which captures the unique vibrational signatures of glucose molecules in the skin and underlying tissue. By translating these molecular fingerprints into continuous readings, this approach could improve accuracy, reduce discomfort, and offer detailed insights into daily glucose fluctuations, allowing you to manage your health more precisely. The method also has the potential to integrate into compact, wearable devices, offering convenience while maintaining clinical reliability and patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How band-pass Raman spectroscopy detects glucose in your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Band-pass Raman spectroscopy relies on the interaction of light with molecules to identify glucose in the skin and tissue. When a focused laser beam illuminates the skin, most photons scatter without change, but a small fraction interacts with molecules, causing a shift in energy that produces a Raman spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each type of molecule has a distinctive spectral signature, and glucose produces identifiable peaks that can be isolated from signals of proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules. Band-pass optical filters allow the device to focus on the spectral range where glucose signals are strongest, reducing background interference. These signals are then analysed by advanced computational algorithms, which convert the spectral information into glucose concentrations continuously. Because the technique is non-invasive, it allows repeated measurements without puncturing the skin, providing consistent monitoring throughout the day. The approach also lends itself to compact, portable designs, making it suitable for wearable devices that integrate seamlessly into your lifestyle while providing clinically relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What research says about painless, continuous glucose tracking&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c01146" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Analytical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the feasibility of using band-pass Raman spectroscopy for continuous glucose monitoring with a compact, point-of-care device. Researchers demonstrated that the system could reliably detect glucose concentrations with accuracy comparable to standard finger-prick methods. The study highlighted the importance of device calibration, signal processing, and precise optical alignment to ensure reliable readings. The compact design was particularly suitable for use both in clinical settings and in home environments, enabling continuous monitoring without the discomfort of repeated blood sampling. Findings indicated that non-invasive monitoring could reduce both the physical and psychological burden of conventional methods while providing a more comprehensive understanding of glucose dynamics. Continuous monitoring allows identification of trends that might otherwise be missed with intermittent sampling, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits of tracking blood sugar without needles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive glucose monitoring offers clear advantages compared with traditional sampling. Eliminating repeated skin punctures reduces pain, bruising, and the risk of infection. Continuous data provide a dynamic view of glucose fluctuations, allowing you to respond quickly to rising or falling levels. Integration with wearable devices enables real-time data transmission to smartphones or healthcare providers, supporting remote monitoring and personalised care. Because measurements are automated, the method reduces errors associated with sample handling, timing, or technique, improving overall reliability. The approach also allows for long-term tracking, giving both patients and clinicians a richer dataset for informed decision-making regarding diet, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key advantages include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of finger-prick testing and associated discomfort or skin irritation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time continuous monitoring of glucose fluctuations throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced risk of skin infections or minor injuries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with wearable technology for remote data collection and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved adherence due to convenience and ease of use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced errors from manual sampling and handling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential for automated alerts and personalised intervention strategies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced long-term tracking for more informed healthcare decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What challenges still stands in the way of needle-free glucose monitoring&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its promise, band-pass Raman spectroscopy faces several challenges before it can be widely implemented. Variations in skin pigmentation, tissue composition, and ambient environmental conditions can affect the Raman signal, necessitating careful calibration for each individual user. Signal processing must effectively separate glucose peaks from background noise, requiring sophisticated algorithms and extensive validation. Device design also needs to balance compactness, comfort, battery life, and reliable wireless connectivity for continuous wear. Researchers are exploring hybrid systems that combine Raman spectroscopy with complementary sensing methods to improve accuracy and robustness. Ensuring consistent performance across different environments and user conditions remains a critical step. Overcoming these challenges is essential to translating laboratory prototypes into practical, everyday tools suitable for clinical use and long-term patient monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Main challenges include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variability in skin tone, tissue composition, and optical properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interference from ambient light, background fluorescence, or environmental factors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requirement for individual calibration to maintain accurate readings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex signal processing to isolate glucose signals reliably&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Device ergonomics and comfort for continuous wear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring consistent performance across different conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with secure wireless transmission and long-lasting battery solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of hybrid systems to improve accuracy and robustness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

								&lt;p&gt;SANTA FE, N.M. — A hiker in the Gila National Forest was bitten by a coyote that tested positive for rabies, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker didn’t require hospitalization. However, they are receiving “routine treatment” to prevent a rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH conducted testing that confirmed the diagnosis. They stated they have seen three other cases of rabid animals in southwest New Mexico this year — a bobcat in Sierra County, a coyote in Catron County and a dog in Grant Country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is preventable, but only if we take it seriously,” said Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH. “The best way to protect your family — including your pets — is to make sure your animals are vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH recommends the following to stay safe from rabies: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on vaccinations and ensure they wear current license tags.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, call your veterinarian for a rabies booster, even if the wound is superficial.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an animal bites you, wash the area immediately and thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention promptly.     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate horses and other household pets, even if they remain exclusively on your property. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any exposure or bite to your local animal control and call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833 796-8773).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who regularly consume polyphenol-rich foods and drinks, such as tea, coffee, berries, cocoa, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil, may have better long-term heart health, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, led by King’s College London, found that those with higher adherence to polyphenol-rich dietary patterns had lower predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols, natural compounds found in plants, are linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved heart, brain, and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 3,100 adults from the TwinsUK cohort for over a decade and, for the first time, the researchers also analyzed a large number of metabolites in the urine that are produced when the body breaks down polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that diets rich in specific groups of polyphenols were linked to healthier blood pressure and cholesterol profiles, contributing to lower CVD risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers confirmed that higher levels of polyphenol metabolites—especially those derived from specific groups of polyphenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids—had lower cardiovascular risk scores. They also had increased HDL cholesterol, also know as ‘good cholesterol’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-025-04481-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published recently in&lt;/a&gt; BMC Medicine, used a newly developed polyphenol dietary score (PPS) to capture intake of 20 key polyphenol-rich foods commonly consumed, ranging from tea and coffee to berries, olive oil, nuts, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWEET TIP&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure in Older People by Changing Their Oral Microbiome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beet-juice-lowers-blood-pressure-in-older-people-by-changing-their-oral-microbiome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure in Older People by Changing Their Oral Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This score showed stronger associations with cardiovascular health than estimates of total polyphenol intake, likely because it captures overall dietary patterns rather than individual compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that considering the whole diet provides a more accurate picture of how polyphenol-rich foods work together to support long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that long-term adherence to polyphenol-rich diets can substantially slow the rise in cardiovascular risk as people age,” &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/polyphenol-rich-diets-linked-to-better-long-term-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Human Nutrition at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even small, sustained shifts towards foods like berries, tea, coffee, nuts, and whole grains may help protect the heart over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yong Li, first author of the study, said the research provides “strong evidence that regularly including polyphenol-rich foods in your diet is a simple and effective way to support heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while cardiovascular risk naturally increases with age, higher polyphenol intake was associated with a slower progression of risk over the 11-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;

The research indicates that this condition, known as cognitive disengagement syndrome, presents a unique set of challenges that shift as children mature into adolescents. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251344719" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive disengagement syndrome is a condition characterized by a specific pattern of mental functioning. Individuals with this syndrome often exhibit excessive daydreaming, frequent mental confusion, and a general slowing of thinking or behavior. These behaviors were historically described as “sluggish cognitive tempo” in older medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and researchers have debated how to best categorize these symptoms for years. The primary question has been whether these behaviors represent a subset of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or if they constitute a standalone clinical syndrome. Clarifying this distinction is necessary for ensuring that children receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has largely focused on validating the list of fifteen symptoms associated with cognitive disengagement syndrome. Studies conducted in countries such as Brazil, South Korea, and the United States have supported the idea that these symptoms are structurally different from the inattention associated with attention deficits. Structural validity indicates that the symptoms group together reliably and are mathematically distinct from other attention problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the current study aimed to take this understanding a step further by examining clinical categories. They sought to determine if they could identify groups of youth who met the criteria for cognitive disengagement syndrome but did not meet the criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also investigated whether the emotional and social difficulties associated with these conditions change between childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a team of international experts in child psychopathology. G. Leonard Burns of Washington State University and Stephen P. Becker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center led the investigation. They collaborated with Juan José Montaño, Belén Sáez, and Mateu Servera from the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators utilized a nationally representative sample of families residing in Spain to gather their data. They recruited participants through an online platform to ensure a broad demographic reach across the country’s various regions. The final sample consisted of parents reporting on 5,525 children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants ranged in age from 5 to 16 years. To analyze developmental differences, the researchers divided the youth into a childhood group (ages 5 to 10) and an adolescence group (ages 11 to 16). Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Behavior Inventory to rate the frequency of specific behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inventory assessed symptoms related to cognitive disengagement, inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. It also measured functional impairments such as academic struggles, social difficulties, and sleep problems. The researchers used statistical thresholds to create specific clinical groups based on the parents’ ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified children who scored in the clinical range for cognitive disengagement syndrome only. They also identified those who scored in the clinical range for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder only. The latter group was further broken down into three presentations: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first major finding concerned the independence of the two conditions. The data showed that a distinct group of youth exhibited high levels of cognitive disengagement without significant symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This independence was observed in both the childhood and adolescent age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that approximately 2.5 percent of children and 1.5 percent of adolescents in the general population fit the “cognitive disengagement syndrome only” profile. This confirms that the syndrome can exist as a solo clinical entity. However, the study also provided detailed statistics on how often the conditions overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the childhood group, about half of the youth with cognitive disengagement syndrome did not qualify for a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This rate of independence decreased slightly as the children got older. In the adolescent group, roughly one-third of those with cognitive disengagement syndrome did not have a co-occurring attention disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study then examined how these groups differed in terms of emotional and behavioral problems. In the childhood group, those with cognitive disengagement syndrome displayed a significantly higher risk for internalizing disorders. They scored higher on measures of anxiety and depression compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children also exhibited higher rates of somatization. This refers to the expression of psychological distress through physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. This tendency toward physical complaints was more pronounced in the cognitive disengagement group than in any of the attention-deficit groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern of findings shifted noticeably when the researchers analyzed the adolescent group. The gap in anxiety and depression scores between the conditions largely disappeared. Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder reported levels of anxiety and depression that were similar to those with cognitive disengagement syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This convergence suggests different developmental pathways for these disorders. It is possible that depression in cognitive disengagement syndrome is a consistent feature that begins early. Conversely, depression in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may develop later as a reaction to years of academic and social struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep difficulties emerged as a strong and consistent differentiator between the groups. Across both childhood and adolescence, youth with cognitive disengagement syndrome experienced more daytime sleep-related impairment. They were more likely to appear drowsy, lethargic, or tired during the day than their peers with attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nighttime sleep disturbances were also more common in the cognitive disengagement group. This includes trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. While this difference was clear in childhood, the distinction became less consistent in adolescence regarding comparisons with the hyperactive-impulsive group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed social functioning, which revealed nuanced differences. In childhood, the cognitive disengagement group showed higher levels of social withdrawal. These children were more likely to isolate themselves from peer interactions compared to those with attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, peer rejection presented a different dynamic. Children with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder often experience active rejection by peers. The study found that while cognitive disengagement children withdraw, they do not necessarily face the same level of active rejection as hyperactive children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adolescence, the differences in social impairment leveled off. The cognitive disengagement group and the attention-deficit groups showed similar levels of social difficulties. This indicates that while the specific nature of the social problems might differ, the overall impact on social life becomes comparable in the teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic impairment provided one of the clearest distinctions between the conditions. In the adolescent sample, the attention-deficit groups showed significantly greater academic struggles. The combined presentation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was associated with the highest levels of school-related difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents with cognitive disengagement syndrome fared better academically than those with attention deficits. This suggests that the symptoms of daydreaming and mental confusion may be less detrimental to school grades than the symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. This finding aligns with previous research suggesting different functional outcomes for the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at oppositional defiant disorder, which involves a pattern of angry or argumentative behavior. In the adolescent group, those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed significantly higher levels of oppositional behavior. The cognitive disengagement group had lower rates of these disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that externalizing behaviors, such as defiance and aggression, are not central features of cognitive disengagement syndrome. The syndrome appears to be more closely improved with internal distress and withdrawal. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, particularly the combined and hyperactive types, is more strongly linked to outward behavioral conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted several limitations to their study that context is required to interpret the results. The data relied solely on ratings provided by mothers and fathers. The study did not include information from teachers, who often see different behaviors in the classroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study did not include self-reports from the adolescents themselves. Teenagers often have unique insights into their own internal emotional states, particularly regarding anxiety and depression. Future research would benefit from incorporating multiple perspectives to build a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design was cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. This means the researchers looked at different children at different ages at a single point in time. They did not track the same individual children as they grew from age 5 to age 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this design, the suggestions regarding developmental pathways are hypotheses rather than confirmed timelines. Longitudinal research is needed to verify whether children with attention deficits actually develop depression later in life as a result of their struggles. Tracking individuals over time would clarify the cause-and-effect relationships suggested by this data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also emphasized the need to replicate these findings in other cultural contexts. While this study confirms findings from the United States using a Spanish sample, further global research is necessary. Differences in school systems and cultural expectations could influence how these symptoms present and impact functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the study provides strong evidence for the validity of cognitive disengagement syndrome. It reinforces the idea that clinicians should assess for these symptoms separately from attention deficits. Recognizing the unique profile of this syndrome could lead to more targeted and effective interventions for struggling youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251344719" target="_blank"&gt;Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome is Clinically Distinct from ADHD Presentations within Childhood and Adolescence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by G.

As a result, they can push LDL cholesterol far below levels that most people reach with statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28304224/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FOURIER&lt;/a&gt; outcomes trial showed that adding evolocumab to statins dropped LDL to about 30 milligrams per deciliter and reduced major cardiovascular events in high risk patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That result raised a sharp question about whether the benefit came only from changing blood numbers or also from reshaping plaque inside the artery wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering that question meant looking directly at the plaques instead of guessing from cholesterol tests. New invasive imaging tools made it possible to watch plaque in the same artery segment change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intravascular-cameras"&gt;Intravascular cameras&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New tools such as intravascular ultrasound, a catheter based ultrasound that images artery walls from inside, let cardiologists measure plaque volume rather than just the open channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same catheter run can be repeated months later, giving matching before and after pictures of the very same vessel segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light based optical coherence tomography, a high resolution imaging method using reflected light, can see the thin fibrous layer that covers the soft core of a plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can measure how thick that cap is, which matters because very thin caps are more likely to tear and release clot forming material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared spectroscopy (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/near-infrared-spectroscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIS&lt;/a&gt;) uses infrared light absorption patterns to map how much oily lipid sits inside plaque cores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with ultrasound or optical imaging, it helps identify plaques that are especially rich in lipid and therefore more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these invasive cameras give several complementary views of the same disease. One measures size, another shows structure, and a third highlights the chemical makeup inside the plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pcsk9-and-dangerous-plaques"&gt;PCSK9 and dangerous plaques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27846344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLAGOV&lt;/a&gt; trial, nearly one thousand statin treated patients had coronary plaque measured from inside the artery using intravascular ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding evolocumab produced a clear drop in the percentage of the artery wall filled with plaque, and more than half of the patients showed actual regression of plaque volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35431172/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; called HUYGENS used optical coherence tomography and ultrasound in patients who had a type of heart attack called non ST elevation myocardial infarction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolocumab on top of statins made the protective cap thicker and reduced the arc of lipid inside plaques compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35368058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PACMAN-AMI&lt;/a&gt; trial tested the PCSK9 blocker alirocumab in three hundred patients after an acute myocardial infarction, a sudden blockage of a heart artery that kills muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial imaging showed that alirocumab plus high intensity statin therapy shrank plaque burden, reduced lipid rich core, and increased cap thickness in arteries that had not caused the original heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people born with very high cholesterol, a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disorder that causes lifelong high LDL, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37009731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ARCHITECT&lt;/a&gt; trial followed more than one hundred patients on alirocumab and strong statins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over roughly a year and a half, overall plaque burden in the coronary tree fell, and the unstable fibrofatty and necrotic core portion shrank while more stable fibrous and calcified tissue increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-plaque-changes-matter"&gt;Why the plaque changes matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists watch features such as a large lipid core, a very thin fibrous cap, a scar-like tissue layer over plaque, and high inflammation because they signal a plaque that can rupture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These risky plaques may sit in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-linked-to-risk-of-stroke-and-heart-attack/"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt; that look only mildly narrowed on standard angiograms, yet they are often the ones that break and trigger clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging trials now suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors shift plaques away from this high risk pattern toward a quieter, more stable state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these studies, plaques tended to become smaller, more fibrous, less packed with free cholesterol, and better covered by thicker caps that are less likely to split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts in plaque features match what doctors expect when LDL is driven very low for long periods. The imaging results link changes in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-blood-test-detects-cancer-before-symptoms-appear/"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; to physical changes in plaque, which makes the clinical benefits of intensive treatment easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the imaging work follows the same patients over time, it connects LDL reductions with direct evidence of plaque healing in those arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That picture helps explain why treating aggressively, sometimes within days after a heart attack, can change long term risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-artery-imaging"&gt;Lessons from artery imaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies encourage a move from caring only about how narrow an artery looks to caring about what kind of plaque is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modest narrowing made mostly of soft lipid with a thin cap can be more dangerous than a tighter narrowing built from tough fibrous and calcified tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing whether noninvasive scans guided by plaque features, such as low density regions or changes in surrounding fat, can flag people who most need aggressive LDL lowering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that strategy proves reliable, doctors might one day tailor PCSK9 therapy not just to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; numbers, but also to the hidden biology of each patient’s plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, PCSK9 inhibitors remain costly and are usually reserved for people at very high risk who do not reach LDL targets with other treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging could help make those decisions more precise by identifying patients whose plaque still looks dangerous despite apparently good standard therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing trials are exploring how early and how intensively to use these drugs after a heart attack, and whether imaging endpoints should help steer future guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more data emerge, artery cameras may play a growing role in showing when plaque has truly calmed and when more treatment is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11393034/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Atherosclerosis Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 19:06:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNMTNMY3ExTnlBNFdiLWl6MTg0bXVXX0tzVWR5Ukk2YW51RHhFRWhOUndPaVE2c0FfcUs5WHZWc0RVbEZhQXBwVG45MWQzVEFZMmdBSkdGc0JfdlEtV3N1dE0zQ0lXTTF2VzJMWWJINDdkeG5nSXQ0V1A3VWdCQm9aMlJkR2F6R1BEVTVHd0ZzYi1DSFAxbFF0NVpMVDA5SkhUR004REo5elZnWFpqQ1VpNjRnaFRiVk1jUXZ3ZEFn</guid></item><item><title>“Scromiting”是一种与慢性大麻使用有关的奇怪疾病，正在上升- East Idaho News</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/12/scromiting-a-bizarre-condition-linked-to-chronic-marijuana-use-is-on-the-rise/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(CNN) — It was a pain worse than childbirth, said a TikTok mom as she described bouts of uncontrollable vomiting after marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was crying and screaming and I was like ‘I can’t take this anymore!’ I hate my life,” she said. “I’m just begging God, like please make it stop!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dubbed “scromiting” by social media due to the combination of screaming and loud vomiting, the medical name for the condition is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS, which is on the rise in the United States. Habitual users of cannabis, including teenagers, are showing up in emergency rooms complaining of severe intestinal distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They are writhing, holding their stomach, complaining of really bad abdominal pain and nausea,” said Dr. Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, who treats adolescents with the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They vomit and then just continue to vomit whatever they have in their stomach, which can go on for hours,” Wang told CNN in a prior interview. “They often say they took a scalding hot shower before they came to the ER but it didn’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immediate treatment consists of anti-nausea medications and IV fluids to combat dehydration from the vomiting. But patients also undergo a battery of tests to rule out other causes: blood and urine tests, expensive CT scans, unpleasant upper GI endoscopy and gastric emptying tests, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some adolescents, those tests could be repeated again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some of our kids, this is their fifth ER visit in the past two months, with symptoms that they can’t control,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if they wait too long to come in, the condition can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regardless of whether it’s cannabis hyperemesis syndrome or another virus that makes you vomit a lot,” Wang said, “if you let it go too long, you can have electrolyte disturbances, go into shock and have organ failure. CHS is no different.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bizarre condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome burst upon the medical scene in 2004, when a group of Australian researchers wrote about 19 chronic marijuana users who had repeated episodes of abdominal pain and retching. The researchers followed nine of the patients over time and found symptoms went away when cannabis use was stopped but returned when it was restarted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly, over half of the 19 reported using extremely hot baths or showers to self-treat their symptoms. As more and more cases of CHS began to appear, hot bathing as a home treatment became a recurring theme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty universal for these patients to say they need a really, really hot shower, or a really hot bath, to improve their symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why hot? “That’s not entirely clear,” said Wang, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive compound in weed, has access to the body’s pain receptors, so one theory is that the distracting sensation of the extreme heat interrupts the pain cycle, thus easing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To compound the strangeness of the disorder, THC and other cannabinoids in the marijuana plant have been used for pain relief — paradoxically relieving nausea and vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, despite the popularity of marijuana as a painkiller, study results on its effectiveness have been mixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, why would the same compound relieve and also cause pain? Among a myriad of possibilities: dosage levels. Wang points to the ever increasing potency of THC in today’s marijuana products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s been well documented that the amount of THC that now comes in cannabis is increasing substantially,” Wang said. “In the ’90s the average was like 4% or 5%. Now in Colorado, it’s anywhere from 15% to 20%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another mystery: Not all heavy users of weed are affected by CHS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not entirely clear who is predisposed to getting it,” Wang said. “Is it a certain frequency or duration of use? Is it a specific potency? Or is it a specific type of product? We don’t have that data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHS is on the rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data show CHS is a national problem. Between 2005 and 2014 when only medical marijuana was legal in most states, a 2020 study found nearly 1 in 5 people hospitalized for cyclical vomiting in the United States reported concurrent cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, Wang and his colleagues found over 800,000 cases of reported vomiting due to cannabis in Colorado between 2013 and 2018. That’s about a 29% increase since legalization, Wang said. The study, published in September 2021, found the rate was highest in counties with no prior marijuana dispensaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A newer study, published in July 2025, found emergency room visits for adolescents aged 13 to 21 years across the nation increased more than 10-fold between 2016 and 2023. Yet another November 2025 study found the rate of CHS among adults 18 to 35 rose sharply during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 and remained high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, all of these studies have been limited by the lack of a medical diagnosis or insurance billing code to enable objective tracking of CHS. To do the studies, researchers had to compare medical records of vomiting with documented or self-reported cases of marijuana use — data that many people decline to provide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s changed. On October 1, 2025, a US federal committee created R11.16, an official medical diagnosis code for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The World Health Organization did the same, allowing researchers worldwide to better track the condition. Experts say future studies will be more accurate, allowing researchers to shed more light onto this unusual condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNbzI4d2c2YUpQQnNtMzBGVUpfWlNVb0JHYXhYY2RTRXloM1FQcFBHMTBibTNuMFE0NE0zVU9PWVhHT1hPaDhKeGtKSFF2MWQ4VzRaa1p5aHNZTy1xWEZzTFJBTlBObFRUTDBDZlc4dUxQU2FwRmw0SHhjQy13djFCQXh4amR2TDBRMV9oSHBWenhiMEVjVGowSG43UHZrNkpHR0hPY3pVSndKTEhfQVFrMmRCZHVEc1E</guid></item><item><title>核辐射实际上对您的身体有什么影响？ - bgr.com</title><link>https://www.bgr.com/2040801/what-nuclear-radiation-does-body-explained/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

The world understood this in horrifying detail after the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disasters. In each case, people were not simply exposed to radiation, the nuclear radiation rewrote what was happening in their bodies. Bone marrow was affected, thyroid glands absorbed radioactive iodine, and cells mutated quietly over the years after the exposure. Some victims collapsed in a matter of days, others suffered for decades. Scientists have even seen signs of &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/the-dogs-of-chernobyl-may-be-evolving-right-before-our-eyes/" target="_blank"&gt;dogs around Chernobyl mutating and evolving&lt;/a&gt; faster. Nuclear radiation doesn't necessarily announce itself with flames or a loud bang. It works silently and invisibly from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Through years of hard work and experimentation, scientists learned a great deal about radiation. We now understand how it travels through food, which organs it attacks first, and why children can be more vulnerable. Although medicine has advanced, emergency systems have improved, and treatments have become smarter, we still don't know everything there is to know about how nuclear radiation affects human bodies. Nonetheless, here's what we do know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-58482616-7fff-f6c3-a210-5397eba16b19"&gt;Nuclear radiation tears through the human body at the molecular level. When radiation enters the body, it interacts with the cells violently. This process is known as ionization. It knocks electrons loose and destabilizes the chemistry of life. DNA strands can snap, proteins lose their shape, and healthy cells suddenly become broken factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First to suffer are systems where cells divide fastest. Children are most affected because their growing bodies divide cells at faster rates than adults. Bone marrow may stop producing white cells, leading to infections, hemophilia, and excessive fatigue. The lining of the gut can peel away, causing to violent vomiting and dehydration. Skin exposed to high doses of radiation blisters and dies as if it were severely burned. Within weeks, the exposed person can lose their hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some radioactive particles don't just pass through our bodies. If radioactive dust is inhaled or swallowed, it often settles in the lungs, bones, or thyroid. Cesium, for example, mimics potassium and spreads through soft tissue. Strontium behaves like calcium and embeds itself in bones. Once inside, these particles can continue irradiating the human body for months and even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;High doses and sudden exposure can lead to the quick development of radiation poisoning. Confusion, nausea, weakness, and collapse are the first symptoms. Although lower exposure may seem harmless, if it's constant or over a prolonged period of time, it may cause cancer. That's why scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/scientific-breakthrough-could-make-x-ray-scans-safer-by-reducing-radiation/" target="_blank"&gt;working to make X-ray scans safer&lt;/a&gt; and reduce the amount of radiation we're exposed to over our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

Disasters like Chernobyl, Fukushima, Three Mile Island, and other &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-the-most-contaminated-nuclear-location-in-america/" target="_blank"&gt;contaminated nuclear locations&lt;/a&gt; taught the world that nuclear radiation doesn't behave in neat, predictable ways. Once it escapes into the environment, it's devastating. Radioactive iodine was found in milk days after Chernobyl. Ocean currents carried Fukushima contamination across the Pacific. Radiation doesn't fade like smoke. It lingers, seeps, and settles. It caused many towns to be erased from maps because the area remains unsafe for human life for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Medicine used these accidents to learn what the human body can survive, and what it cannot. Doctors now understand radiation burns, radiation sickness, and bone-marrow failure far better than before. The link between radiation and thyroid cancer became undeniable after thousands of cases appeared in exposed children in Ukraine. Since then, protective medicine such as potassium iodide became a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite everything we learned, some mysteries remain. Scientists still can't precisely predict who will develop cancer after low-level exposure and who will not. Two people can receive the same doses of radiation and face completely different futures. The effects of long-term exposure to small doses remain deeply uncertain. We know radiation damages DNA, but what we don't know is how often the repairs of damaged DNA fail. We also cannot predict when and if a damaged cell will turn into a cancerous one, because radiation alone is not the only mechanism behind tumors. Accidents such as Chernobyl give us data, but not nearly enough to completely understand the dangers of nuclear radiation to human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We may have been overestimating the role of a pathological class of misfolded protein in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called prions, these molecules are responsible for conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-mad-cow-disease-emerges-in-the-us"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; or 'mad cow disease', &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-deer-disease-zoonotic-transfer-suspected-after-two-human-deaths"&gt;chronic wasting disease&lt;/a&gt; in deer, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/infectious-deadly-prions-in-people-s-eyes-could-be-a-biohazard-scientists-warn"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt; in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in mice has found that some of the hallmarks of prion disease in brain tissue – such as the appearance of sponge-like holes, scarring, and accumulation of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; – can develop even in the complete absence of prions in their infectious configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/misfolded-proteins-could-make-dementia-transmissible-scientists-suggest"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misfolded Proteins Could Make Dementia Transmissible, Scientists Suggest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the study found that non-infectious prion precursors in the presence of chronic inflammation driven by a bacterial endotoxin were enough to trigger prion-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests we have overlooked some of the mechanisms that contribute to prion diseases, and in some cases, even mistaken the underlying cause. It also has implications for prion-like conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="183897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and ALS, in which misfolded proteins are central to irreversible brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183907" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183907" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183907" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Spongiform encephalopathy under the microscope. (UCSF/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases –  found in humans – are the terrifying result of a normal biological process going randomly awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins consist of sequences of amino acids precisely folded to perform specific functions. They don't always work quite as intended, though; cells make wonky, misfolded, non-functional proteins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40035-017-0077-5"&gt;all the time&lt;/a&gt;. Your body is also pretty good at unfolding or destroying the wonky proteins when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On extremely rare occasions, however, some types of misfolded protein can become a prion. Not only do they not function as they should, but these oddly-shaped proteins also force other proteins to adopt the same misfolded shape. Worse still, they resist the body's protease clean-up mechanisms, allowing them to accumulate and destroy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a cog with a bent tooth; every cog it interlocks with also ends up with a bent tooth, which it then passes on to its adjacent cogs, and so on. The result is an unstoppable spread of dysfunction. What makes it even more horrifying is that prions are, by definition, infectious; they can be spread between individuals, most commonly by consuming prion-contaminated meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins that can turn into prions are called prion proteins, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_prion_protein"&gt;PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A misfolded PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't have to become a prion – that's a very specific, infectious type of misfolding – but recent evidence suggests that the other, non-infectious ways PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; can misfold may also trigger neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other emerging evidence suggests that a bacterial endotoxin called lipopolysaccharide (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"&gt;LPS&lt;/a&gt;), found on the outer membranes of some bacteria, can accelerate prion disease by inducing protease resistance in prion proteins. It also activates the host immune system's inflammatory response, further contributing to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by immunologist Burim Ametaj of the University of Alberta in Canada, a team of researchers used transgenic mice to determine the contribution of misfolded, non-infectious PrP and chronic inflammation to prion-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-human-prion-created-in-a-lab-neurodegenerative-disease"&gt;artificially generated&lt;/a&gt; a misfolded form of a PrP that is toxic to neurons without being infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they divided their study mice into six groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first group was given only saline – that was the control group. The second group was administered LPS, and the third group the toxic, misfolded, non-infectious PrP. The fourth group received both. The fifth group received actual infectious prions, and the sixth group received prions and LPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183913" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183913" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread-600x464.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183913" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This 2011 photomicrograph shows how prions, colored red, spread between mouse neural tissue cells. (&lt;a href="https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=18131"&gt;NIAID&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the researchers carefully monitored and tested their mice for up to 750 days, studying their brains for spongiform changes, protease resistance, a type of brain scarring called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"&gt;astrogliosis&lt;/a&gt;, and amyloid plaques – all of which are associated with prion disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group that was given just the misfolded, non-infectious PrP alone developed the spongiform brain damage and scarring, but not the protease-resistant PrP that defines infectious prions. Meanwhile, the LPS-only group developed amyloid plaques, spongiform damage, and a high 40 percent mortality rate – but again, no protease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining LPS with the non-infectious PrP misfold did not increase lethality, but holes in the brains of mice in this group did grow larger. Finally, combining the prion with LPS dramatically accelerated the course of the disease. All of the mice in this group died within 200 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This fundamentally challenges the prevailing theory that these types of brain diseases are only about prions or similar misfolded proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2025/12/u-of-a-led-research-suggests-new-culprit-in-mad-cow-disease.html"&gt;Ametaj says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that, in at least some prion diseases, the host may first be weakened by inflammation before the protein misfolding that leads to prion formation – that prion disease may not actually start with prions, but with inflammation, or the non-infectious, misfolded PrP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's-like presentation of the mice administered only with LPS has some interesting implications. It suggests that inflammation may play a key role in kicking off neurodegenerative, prion-like diseases – echoing other recent studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-reveal-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;that have found links&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-yet-again"&gt;inflammation and Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It opens up an entire anti-inflammatory medicine toolkit. Bacterial endotoxins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-024-00722-y"&gt;have been found&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, so risk factors that reduce dementia – exercise, anti-inflammatory diets, gut health, metabolic health – might work partly by reducing endotoxin burden," &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2025/12/u-of-a-led-research-suggests-new-culprit-in-mad-cow-disease.html"&gt;Ametaj says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These diseases are complex, but if endotoxin exposure contributes to even 20 to 30 per cent of cases, controlling this modifiable risk factor could spare millions of people. We might prevent some neurodegenerative diseases the way we prevent heart disease, by managing inflammatory risk factors throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a field where there's been little hope, that matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136245"&gt;&lt;i&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These encouraging results come from a study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, which is taken as a tablet, works in a completely different way from well-known GLP-1-based medications such as Ozempic that are given through injections. GLP-1 drugs influence hunger by altering communication between the gut and the brain, and they can cause side effects that include appetite loss, decreased muscle mass, and gastrointestinal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Muscle Metabolism Rather Than Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of acting on hunger pathways, the new compound boosts metabolic activity directly within skeletal muscle. In animal studies, it improved blood sugar levels and body composition while avoiding the drawbacks commonly linked to today's GLP-1-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase I clinical trial involving 48 healthy volunteers and 25 individuals with type 2 diabetes indicates that the treatment is also well tolerated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results point to a future where we can improve metabolic health without losing muscle mass. Muscles are important in both type 2 diabetes and obesity, and muscle mass is also directly correlated with life expectancy," says Tore Bengtsson, professor at the Department of Molecular Bioscience, Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Type of β2 Agonist Designed for Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active substance is based on a laboratory-developed molecule, a form of β2 agonist. This molecule activates key signaling pathways in a novel manner that benefits muscle function while avoiding the heart overstimulation typically associated with β2 agonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This drug represents a completely new type of treatment and has the potential to be of great importance for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our substance appears to promote healthy weight loss and, in addition, patients do not have to take injections," says Shane C. Wright, assistant professor at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential as a Stand-Alone or Combination Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this drug operates through a mechanism distinct from GLP-1 medications, it may be effective on its own or when paired with GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This makes them valuable both as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with GLP-1 drugs," says Shane C. Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Research Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage in development is a larger phase II clinical trial planned by Atrogi AB, the company leading the drug's advancement. This study will examine whether the positive effects observed in earlier research also appear in people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work represents a collaboration involving Professor Volker M. Lauschke and teams from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm University, Uppsala University, the University of Copenhagen, Monash University, and the University of Queensland. Funding came from the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and additional sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several authors are employed by or hold shares in Atrogi AB, which financed the clinical trial. Tore Bengtsson is the founder and chief scientific officer of Atrogi AB, which is continuing to develop the drug candidate, and he and a co-author have applied for patents related to the substances examined in the study. Additional company affiliations are detailed in the full publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
