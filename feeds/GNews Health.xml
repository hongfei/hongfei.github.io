Importantly, eating breakfast later with aging was linked to a higher risk of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status,” lead author &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/14405948/Hassan-Dashti" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a senior couple eating breakfast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity,” senior author Dr. Altug Didikoglu, MSc, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey, said in the statement. “Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,’ especially for older individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/eating-breakfast-later-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-11804603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 04:25:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE02TXVESzlxQVYwRU4xOWwzWTYwdG1zZGNNNW9qSnNfcHBtcTVDZjJNdk1RMk53RTFOYUdwNnZ4R0RFeUl2MVlSQ2pPeFNPZWo4aWRkLUdIcmR4R25hZDlDeDJyOWctZHhPWE5SN2ZEZFpZU09KVTNSbg</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心表示，与代谢膳食有关的沙门氏菌爆发使十几人患病， 7人住院治疗-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salmonella-outbreak-metabolic-meals-cdc/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-0" data-index="0" data-path="/news/salmonella-outbreak-metabolic-meals-cdc/" class="content content-article lazyload"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metabolic Meals is a home delivery meal subscription service focused on macro-friendly meals, &lt;a href="https://mymetabolicmeals.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to their website. CBS News has reached out to Metabolic Meals for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC advised people to check their refrigerator or freezer for any affected products and do not eat them; throw them away or contact the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic Meals is working with investigators and has "reached out to customers directly who purchased the meal types listed above to inform them of the outbreak," the CDC said in their statement. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials said about 16 people reported symptoms and seven were hospitalized, but officials cautioned the number of people affected might be higher, as it usually takes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/reporting-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;3 to 4 weeks&lt;/a&gt; to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A western Minnesota woman is speaking out about her life-changing experience with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-west-nile-virus-cases-2025/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; amid a rise in reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarissa Sparkl, 37, of Montevideo, experienced a case so severe that she now stays in an assisted living facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you get West Nile, there is nothing you can do about it. It takes a week to diagnose it," Lori Winterfeld, Sparkl's mom, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's how long it took to diagnose Sparkl's condition. By that time, her health had taken a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She got sick on a Friday, and by Monday she was hospitalized and intubated," Winterfeld said. "The only thing she could move initially were her eyebrows. And then she could eventually blink. It's been a long, long haul."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparkl added, "I didn't know what happened because I was young and healthy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Her family believes she may have been bitten by a mosquito carrying West Nile in her own backyard. She also takes medication for multiple sclerosis, which Winterfeld thinks may have made it harder to fight off the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One percent of the cases of West Nile are neuroinvasive, and hers hit her brain stem," Winterfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparkl became so weak that last year, she was forced to leave her husband, Jesse, and 10-year-old daughter behind, and move into a nursing facility in St. Paul. That's where Winterfeld takes care of her during the week, and Jesse drives from Montevideo to be with her on the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, some movement has returned to her arms and her hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal now is to get Sparkl off her breathing tube, and once that happens, she can go home. Her family is hoping that it can happen by November.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really hard because I love my daughter," Sparkl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winterfeld added, "It's been hard on her, too, not having a mom at home. Video chat is wonderful. She gets to see her mom every day, and she gets to talk to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a homecoming on the horizon, the fight against the virus will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a bad year for West Nile. In every state, it was very early," Winterfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she got sick, Sparkl worked as a social worker, a teacher and a pharmacy technician. A GoFundMe page has been set up in her name to help pay for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a while
since we’ve had a COVID update, eh, readers? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, with the
virus going around lately, and with changes in who is eligible for
vaccine boosters (big changes? or maybe not?), we figured it was time
to check back in with Dr. Candy Stockton, our county health officer,
who was kind enough to catch the &lt;i&gt;Outpost&lt;/i&gt;
up earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up: You’ve
probably noticed that the ’rona has been going around lately. Dr.
Stockton said that although the county’s Public Health Division no
longer tracks raw case numbers like it did in the bad old days of the
pandemic, it has definitely noticed that the virus is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Stockton
says, Humboldt County seems to be falling into a coronavirus pattern.
We usually get a smallish spike in the late summer – now – and a
larger spike in January and February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, the spike
this summer is smaller than last summer’s spike, which is good, but
it’s very definitely impacting people,” Stockton told us. “People
are missing work. Kids are missing school. It’s impacting our
hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one
Humboldt County person has died of the virus in the last month,
Stockton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/116915"&gt;newish
variant of the virus going around&lt;/a&gt;, one they’re calling the
“XFG” or “Stratus” variant that seems to be quickly on the
rise in the United States, and which is garnering some news
attention. But Stockton is of the same opinion as the people quoted
at the link in the last sentence: From the public’s perspective,
there really isn’t much concerning about XFG. It’s not a
particularly nasty version of the bug, and current vaccines should be
effective against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of
vaccines: This year’s crop of booster shots has been approved by
the FDA, and vials should be reaching Humboldt County outlets within
the next few days or weeks. But you’ve no doubt read about the
Centers for Disease Control’s new guidelines about who should be
receiving the shots – people 65 or older, or those with serious
preexisting conditions. What does that mean for people under 65, or
those who may or may not have those conditions? Can you still get
your shot if you want them, even if you don’t meet those criteria?
And where can you get it? And will your insurance pay for it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that
still not quite clear about all of this, but Stockton, right now, is
that the coming year is actually not going to be all that different
from years previous. She’s pretty certain that as in years past,
pretty much the only thing you’ll need to get a COVID shot is the
desire to have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the major
pharmacy chains are waiting for a little bit more clarity and
guidance from the states that they work in before they make that
final determination,” she said. “But we do think that, yes,
people probably will be able to walk into the pharmacy, let the
pharmacist know that they’re at high risk or they live with somebody
who’s at high risk, and be able to get the vaccine. And that’s what
we’re working towards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, New York
Governor Kathy Hochul &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;signed
an executive order&lt;/a&gt; allowing that state’s pharmacists to
administer the shot. California, Oregon and Washington – the states
that make up the new “&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/california-oregon-washington-form-health-alliance-amid-federal-vaccine-tensions-2025-09-03/"&gt;West
Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;” – will probably do something similar,
if they need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Stockton
said, insurance companies have signaled that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-insurers-likely-cover-updated-covid-shots-this-year-industry-sources-say-2025-08-28/"&gt;they
are willing to pay for shots&lt;/a&gt;, as they have in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[It] makes a lot
of sense because vaccines are a relatively inexpensive, very
cost-effective way to reduce medical costs,” Stockton said. “So
if you’re an insurer and you choose not to pay for a vaccine that can
say, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospitalization
costs, it doesn’t take very long before you’re losing more money than
you’re actually saving by not paying for the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So despite
high-profile announcements coming from the Trump Administration,
Stockton and others are fairly confident that nothing much is set to
change in the short-term. Vaccines will be available in time for that
big spike that the county’s expecting in the winter, and right now
Stockton believes that if you want one, you will be able to get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Stockton –
coming at it from a public health perspective – very much hopes
that you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While I
understand every person ultimately needs to make that decision for
themselves, I do want to remind all of your readers that our
healthcare resources — our hospital capacity, emergency room
capacity — we’re stretched really thin as a county right now,” she
said. “And it may not seem like a big deal if five or six people
get hospitalized one week for COVID during the winter, if you’re just
talking about numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I think most
people in this county have experienced, you know, having to go into
the emergency room. And then having to spend a really long time in
the emergency room because there are no open beds upstairs in the
hospital. And so for those people who are able and willing, they
could really help us out as a community by getting vaccinated to help
our community. If they’re willing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these people, regardless of what state they are in, getting the vaccine would mean a pharmacist or doctor would have to go "off-label" to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's very gray on how a pharmacist may proceed in that scenario," Groves told Ars. Going off-label could open pharmacists up to liability concerns, she said. And even if a patient can obtain a prescription for an off-label vaccine, that still may not be enough to allow a pharmacist to administer the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pharmacists have something called 'corresponding responsibility,' Groves explained. "So even if a physician, or a nurse practitioner, or whomever may send a prescription over for that vaccine, that pharmacist still has that responsibility to ensure this is the right medication, for the right patient, at the right time, and that they're indicated for it," she said. So, it would still be going outside what they're technically authorized to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors, on the other hand, can administer vaccines off-label, which they might do if they choose to follow guidance from medical organizations like AAP and ACOG, or if they think it's best for their patient. They can do this without any heightened professional liability, contrary to some suggestions Kennedy has made (doctors prescribe things off-label all the time). But, people may have to schedule an appointment with their doctor and convince them to provide the shot—a situation far less convenient than strolling into a local pharmacy. Also, since pharmacies have provided the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines so far, some doctors' offices may not have them on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if pregnancy still falls under the FDA's criteria for a high-risk condition. It was included in the list that FDA officials published in May. However, the agency did not make that list official when it changed the vaccine labels last month. Some experts have suggested that, in this case, the qualifying high-risk conditions default to the CDC's existing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;list of high-risk conditions&lt;/a&gt;, which includes pregnancy. But it's not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week Dr Xand van Tulleken, the public health specialist and broadcaster, expressed concern about the “massively confusing” array of health supplements being pushed as daily&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; essentials by influencers on social media. “They are a perfect product to sell: massive profit margins, long shelf lives, they’re light and easy to ship … people never return them, the regulations are light,” he told Radio 4’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today &lt;/i&gt;programme. And while some people might benefit from taking certain supplements for certain periods of time, they don’t all work for everyone. “Do not get your health advice from Instagram and don’t get your health advice from anyone who is selling you the product that they’re trying to persuade you is healthy,” Van Tulleken added. “The NHS has some pretty good guidelines on which people might want to consider supplementation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So what — if anything — should you be taking? If in doubt, speak to a GP or pharmacist before taking a pill or powder, especially if you are on other medication or have underlying health conditions. Here, with the help of nutrition experts, we look at what adults need to know before buying any of the popular pills:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Essential for maintaining the health of bones, teeth, muscles and immune function, vitamin D also enables the body to absorb the teeth and bone-building nutrients calcium and phosphorus. “It plays a key role in preventing the systemic inflammation that is linked to many chronic diseases,” says Dr Linia Patel, a researcher in the department of clinical sciences and community health at the Universita degli Studi di Milano in Italy and a spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association (BDA). Food is not the best source — only small amounts are found in dairy products, oily fish, cod liver oil, milk and eggs — and most vitamin D comes from exposure to sunshine for 15 minutes a day between April and September (30 minutes if you have darker skin). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A deficiency may affect the health of bones, teeth and muscles and government figures suggest that “one in six adults in the UK have low levels”. A study in the BMJ involving 449,943 adults concluded that “taking supplements was associated with a lower risk of vitamin D deficiency”. “Research also links a deficiency with impaired immune function,” says the dietician Bahee Van de Bor, a spokeswoman for the BDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yes, everyone should take a supplement of 10mcg a day from the end of September until April, according to the NHS. All children aged 1 to 4, all babies (unless taking more than 500ml of fortified formula milk) and anyone at risk of low levels (the over-65s, the housebound or those working indoors and people with darker skin) should take a supplement all year round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-d-supplements-ageing-cch2j258r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin D supplements could counter ageing, study suggests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Creatine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Popular with gymgoers looking for muscle definition and speedy recovery from exercise, creatine is a compound produced naturally in the body. It is present in red meat and seafood and plays an important role in cell regulation and in the regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the compound that provides cells with the energy they need to function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Creatine is one of the most widely studied of all fitness and health supplements because it is so popular. A paper in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition confirmed it boosts exercise performance and helps with injury prevention and recovery. Others take it to boost brain health, although last year the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) rejected claims that creatine may improve cognitive function. Although with more studies emerging, such as a paper in Nature journal that found a single dose of creatine boosted cognition in sleep-deprived people, we should probably watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sporty types and the over-65s might want to try it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/creatine-supplement-muscles-memory-experience-advice-7gmsvllmz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is creatine the secret weapon for midlife women?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Lion’s mane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The lion’s mane mushroom grows on old tree trunks and contains the compounds hericenones and erinacines, which are believed to boost brain health and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study in the journal Antioxidants showed hericenones and erinacines might help to enhance the growth of brain cells. But many of the studies have been small and on animals.

Magnesium activates important enzymes in the body and is involved in the secretion of hormones needed for bone metabolism. It is a popular sleep aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some researchers, including the authors of a paper in Complementary Medicine and Therapies, have shown that a magnesium deficiency disrupts nerve signalling, which changes levels of sleep-inducing hormones such as melatonin in the body. Men aged 15 and older and girls aged 15-18 need 300mg magnesium per day; women aged 19 plus need 270mg daily. Unless you have been diagnosed with a deficiency, the NHS says we should be able to get all of the magnesium we need from foods including nuts and seeds, leafy greens, pulses, yoghurt and fish. It is unlikely to improve your sleep if you get enough magnesium in your diet anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It’s very hard to overdose on magnesium as it has laxative effects if you have the dosage wrong so will pass through the body,” Patel says. “I tell my patients to try 300mg for 12 weeks and see if you notice a difference.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Probiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These are supplements of beneficial bacteria that help to create balance in our microbiome, the vast ecosystem of bacteria, fungi and yeasts that inhabit our intestines, and might enhance your health, immunity and mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There is plenty of evidence that some probiotics are helpful, but you do need to choose the right type. According to Dr Gemma Walton, a researcher at the University of Reading’s Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, products with lots of evidence sit on shelves next to probiotics that have very little research behind them. Not all bacteria strains in probiotics have the same effects and supplements should be selected according to symptoms or requirements. Walton and a team of nutrition scientists from the University of Reading, the University of Leeds, King’s College London and the US and Canada-based Alliance for Education in Probiotics have compiled a comprehensive guide to science backed probiotic supplements at probioticguide.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking them? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly, although consult your GP or &lt;a href="http://www.probioticguide.uk" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;probioticguide.uk&lt;/a&gt; for effective products that meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/gut-health-guide-best-probiotics-app-apple-android-vm65v653q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The experts’ guide to the probiotics that work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Important in supporting immune function, vitamin C also helps the body to produce collagen needed for the healing and maintenance of healthy skin. It is needed to keep blood vessels, bones and cartilage healthy and to help the body absorb iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Vitamin C is water soluble, meaning excess levels are excreted in urine, not stored in the body, so we all need a regular intake. Current NHS recommendations state that anyone aged 15 and older needs 40mg a day; under-15s need 30-35mg daily. Taking extra in supplement form won’t prevent a cold but might cut it short by up to 1.5 days, according to a 2023 review of ten published studies by scientists at the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are not a big fruit and veg eater, or if you are a smoker (it destroys vitamin C in the body), you might consider a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-c-anyone-the-truth-about-immunity-boosters-gnkhlds2c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin C, anyone?

It is said to reduce stress and anxiety by lowering levels of hormones such as cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One review of 12 clinical trials involving 1,002 people aged 25 to 48 published in the journal Phytotherapy Research found that 300-600mg a day “significantly reduced anxiety”. However, many of the purported benefits for ashwagandha such as better sleep, improved energy levels and concentration are anecdotal or based on very small studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;No. The UK Food Standards Agency is reviewing evidence and last year said that it was “aware there are potential risks to health from consuming ashwagandha in food supplements” such as possible effects on thyroid function and liver toxicity. In 2024 the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment warned it may not be safe for children, pregnant women and people with liver conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="2.47"&gt;&lt;div id="26a1728e-fa37-4698-a72d-03cf8c4c6615"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Collagen is usually combined with vitamin C, found in orange juice, for better absorption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Collagen is our body’s structural protein — the scaffolding that glues together tissues like bones, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and skin. Supplements of it are derived from animal sources, such as beef or fish, and usually combined with vitamin C for better absorption. People take it for strong muscles and tendons but also — like the many celebrities extolling its virtues on Instagram — for more radiant, plump skin and bouncy hair and healthy nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It has been shown in small studies from Liverpool John Moores University and University College London to improve tendon and muscular health in elite athletes. But a review of 23 clinical trials with 1,474 participants that looked at the effects of collagen on improving skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles for a study published this month in the American Journal of Medicine concluded: “There is currently no clinical evidence to support the use of collagen supplements to prevent or treat skin ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Probably not. Only worth considering if you are an injury-prone professional footballer or Olympian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/health-products-dont-need-health-trends-supplements-ckppsdd9v" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 health products you don’t need — from sports drinks to collagen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The active ingredient in the blazing yellow spice turmeric is curcumin, which has proven anti-inflammatory properties. It is often taken as a remedy for everything from high cholesterol and hay fever to depression and aching joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The evidence supporting turmeric supplementation is mixed. A study in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine found that turmeric is as effective as omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) medicine for reducing excess stomach acid. And a combination of curcumin and piperine, an alkaloid in black pepper that has potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, was shown in the Journal of Sports Science Medicine to reduce muscle damage and soreness caused by exercise if taken before and after a workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Not enough is yet known about its effect on joints, though, and a 2017 review in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry stated that many of the purported benefits of curcumin for health issues and joint pain are “highly improbable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you exercise hard or if you suffer from stomach acid. “But find one with black pepper as it is needed for absorption of turmeric by the body,” Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Zinc is a mineral needed for the development and function of immune cells, which is why zinc supplements are a top choice for defending against winter viruses such as colds. It is also found in meat, poultry, shellfish, nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2024 Cochrane Library review revealed that “zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds”, although the authors did concede that zinc supplementation might be helpful in reducing “the duration of ongoing colds”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you are over 60 when our ability to absorb zinc declines, says Dr Jenna Macciochi, a senior lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex and author of &lt;i&gt;Immune to Age&lt;/i&gt;. “Short-term small doses of 10-40mg of zinc supplements or lozenges taken over a few days could be helpful if you have cold symptoms,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Glucosamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A compound used by the body to make the chemicals needed to build strong muscles, tendons and cartilage, glucosamine is among the most popular supplements taken to relieve and prevent knee and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A review of studies involving 4,000 people in archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery reported that glucosamine supplements had little or no effect on relieving osteoarthritis knee pain.

Symptoms of low intakes include fatigue, muscle pains, poor memory and reduced cognitive function. In February 2025 researchers from the University of California reported in the Annals of Neurology that older people with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, displayed signs of cognitive decline. “Clinicians should consider [B12] supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yes, if you are vegan, vegetarian or follow a strict plant-based diet.

Men need 8.7mg daily; women aged 11-50 need 14.8mg and all over-50s need 8.7mg daily, which is easily obtainable in the diet from meat and fish, beans, pulses and leafy green vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, estimates that 3 per cent of men and 8 per cent of women have iron-deficiency anaemia, resulting in tiredness and weakness, with 57,000 emergency admissions to hospital each year due to the condition. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that found about 25 per cent of healthy adults in their seventies and older developed iron-deficiency anaemia within five years of enrolling in the study. Taking a low-dose daily aspirin (sometimes recommended by the NHS to prevent blood clots from forming in arteries of people at higher risk of heart disease) increased the risk by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Possibly if you are a woman with heavy menstrual bleeding or are pregnant or have an iron deficiency diagnosed by a blood test. “Children who are picky eaters may also need a supplement,” Van de Bor says. Multivitamins often contain at least 100 per cent of the daily requirement or about 14mg whereas iron-only supplements typically contain 15-20mg. Make sure you don’t take both. Taking extra iron if you are not lacking it in the diet can be toxic, says the NHS, and iron supplements should always be kept away from children for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Psyllium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sometimes billed as a cheaper alternative to weight loss jabs, psyllium, or ispaghula, husk is derived from the mainly soluble fibre outer shell of the &lt;i&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/i&gt; plant. It contains a compound called arabinoxylan, which forms a gel when it comes into contact with water in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The effects of supplementation are well researched with studies showing it may help to lower our cholesterol by converting cholesterol into bile acids, dampen blood sugar spikes and reduce inflammation. It’s also a prebiotic — providing food for beneficial bacteria in the gut. And the NHS says it helps to bulk up poo to treat constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Only if you have constipation. The NHS says brands such as Fybogel and Ispagel, available from pharmacies, can be taken short term with plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is a popular supplement for heart health. Omega-3 essential fatty acids include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is needed for your body to make eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Both are important for healthy blood vessels, heart and immune system. These omega-3 fatty acids cannot be made in the body and need to be consumed in our diets. Good food sources are oily fish (mackerel, herring, sardines) and nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This year a British Journal of Nutrition paper suggested that high-dose fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids had greater cardio-protective effects than eating oily fish alone. However, last year a BMJ study showed that omega-3 supplements might help in stalling the progression of heart disease in those who already have it but might increase the risk of others developing a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The British Heart Foundation says you do not need to take omega-3 supplements unless told to do so by a doctor, but that if you are not a fish eater, you might consider a capsule. Look for one that provides about 450mg a day of DHA and EPA omega-3s, the foundation suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Multivitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A comprehensive multivitamin will contain vitamins, minerals and sometimes other nutrients that may be difficult to get in restrictive or low-calorie diets. Different products will have a different mix of nutrients so look for one with a wide range of vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A BMJ study of over 20,000 people showed that taking a multivitamin offered no greater protection against health conditions than not taking one. However, it might be worthwhile for people over 60. After studies on 5,000 adults aged 60-plus, JoAnn Manson, head of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition last year that a daily multivitamin helped to slow cognitive ageing. More recently, Manson told the American Heart Association conference that multivitamins slowed biological ageing by between 10 and 20 per cent in people who took them daily for two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Should I be taking it? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Worth trying if you have a poor diet or are in your sixties or older, when our bodies become less efficient at absorbing some vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQTDlTeldpZEhUZDJWLWtOTlhjYjJSbk5oZUpIVmMzb2JYbFZTY0xvRi1hTDJoQnhScjB3VkhXR0NKbkx4OE9FTEt4d0JwZmVWa1cwQi1rWjROWjBwd19BdEVRNGFueE56WWFQa3JNY1pkZV9WcFdBRDNaZUFfQjgxdlJVb2hLeUJHcEVwMmF3WDZmU1JGbHNtbXNCa1dTWjhlVDBVOQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心在十几份送货上门餐点可能感染沙门氏菌后发出警报- WSB-TV</title><link>https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/cdc-puts-out-alert-after-more-than-dozen-get-salmonella-likely-home-delivery-meals/KNYWBKORINBGFM4YIWCPPWTTTI/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;ATLANTA — The CDC is putting out an alert after more than a dozen people across 10 states have gotten Salmonella infections tied to home delivery meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Health officials say two people in Georgia are among the 16 people who have gotten sick from different varieties of Metabolic Meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;According to the CDC, these are the meals impacted by the health alert:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Select meals delivered during the week of July 28, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four Cheese Tortellini with Pesto Sauce and Grilled Chicken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25199&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/07/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low Carb Chicken Teriyaki and Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25202&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/05/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Garlic &amp;amp; Ranch Chicken Tenders with Roasted Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25205&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/08/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sliced Top Sirloin with Roasted Peanut Sauce and Summer Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lot Code: 25203&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best By: 08/06/2025&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional meal lot codes include: 25199, 25202, 25203, 25204, 25205&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;The CDC says if you have any of these meals, to throw them out or contact the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Most people who get sick from Salmonella usually experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRENDING STORIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms will start anywhere from six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria.

In some instances, the bacteria enters the body through open wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, seven cases have been confirmed in Florida Panhandle waters. Three of those cases were contracted in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Gallagher says she wishes she had known the risks before jumping in the water. She says she almost lost her leg and her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is still fighting off the infection. She says she never would have gotten vibrio if government officials took certain precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher is the newest victim in a string of vibrio vulnificus infections in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I would have had heard of vibrio, yes, I would have been like, 'I'm not getting in that water at all,'" said Gallagher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, her husband and seven-year-old daughter went swimming in Santa Rosa Sound in late July. Less than a week later, she was rushed into surgery, diagnosed with a vibrio infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was intubated for about six days and finally woke up and saw that I had a leg that didn't even look like my own leg anymore," Gallagher said. "Because they had to clean away so much of that flesh-eating bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county currently doesn't do routine testing for vibrio in the water. Environmental specialist Sava Varazo says that needs to change. He says the bacteria can be detected with a quick, inexpensive litmus test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good, reliable," Varazo said. "It's a high reliability test. It's simple to implement the results... You can get those results very quick sometimes in less than 30 to 40 minutes, so it's a quick, reliable test. It's much better than what we have now, which is nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we were to test for vibrio, we would find vibrio in every sample that we tested," Escambia County's senior scientist Chips Kirschenfeld said. "The problem is there's really nothing we can do as far as best management practices or any kind of upland treatment to reduce those numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you really think about the number of people who get infected in the water, the numbers are really quite low," he said. "You know, here in the Escambia County, we have an average of five infections per year. We have a million people that go to Pensacola Beach every year and five people get infections. That's 0.0005% chance of getting a vibrio infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirschenfeld says this about the choice for the county to do routine vibrio testing, or post educational signage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That, that's certainly a political decision," said Kirschenfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Gallagher, the answer is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said there needs to be signs out there stating there is flesh-heating bacteria to be known to be in this water, or they need to have those signs and they need to have testing done during the summertime saying levels are high, levels are low, whatever," Gallagher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since she contracted vibrio, Gallagher has had multiple surgeries in various hospitals around the state. Her family has started &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/genevieves-fight-against-vibrio" target="_blank" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/genevieves-fight-against-vibrio" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;a GoFundMe to help with the costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WEAR-TV</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:14:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNenhYS25ibTUxdHFXMUxFVEFkQkhoWklZMFZMT3c0dHRFZFdiX0xDRXI0MC1iU2lPR1BjbTA3dWFqRmd1SllOUzM0SjJDa3gzZGhydHVESkdUb01UR2tyTGszYmNSYThvMEVhZGhwNEVtZXNTc1ByMVNCa3VwdEd4dUJ6SXNiQXMyRDI0aEdZMWl2RGtDWXFKRkFfTQ</guid></item><item><title>在领养活动中被忽视的小猫不知道这是因为它们“与众不同” -渡渡鸟</title><link>https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/kittens-ignored-at-adoption-event-dont-know-its-because-theyre-different</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="NodeArticlestyles__ObscuredContentWrapper-sc-1rwhog1-6 eCcsQv"&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="0"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.nawsus.org/"&gt;NAWS Humane Society of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; held a cat adoption event.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/warren-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;WARREN, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; (WKBN) — A human case of West Nile virus reported by the Trumbull County Combined Health District has been confirmed by the Ohio Department of Health, according to the District.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the first human case in Trumbull County. &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/west-farmington-news/west-nile-virus-detected-in-trumbull-county-mosquito-sample/"&gt;A sample tested positive for West Nile in Trumbull County early this month.&lt;/a&gt; The sample was collected at Hillside Cemetery in West Farmington.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquito samples have tested positive in nearby counties, including &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/grove-city-news/mercer-county-has-more-positive-west-nile-samples/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/grove-city-news/mercer-county-has-more-positive-west-nile-samples/"&gt;Mercer County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/August-2025-Press-Releases/8-18-2025-Allegheny-County-Health-Department-Identifies-1st-Human-Case-of-West-Nile-Virus-in-2025" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/August-2025-Press-Releases/8-18-2025-Allegheny-County-Health-Department-Identifies-1st-Human-Case-of-West-Nile-Virus-in-2025"&gt;Allegheny County&lt;/a&gt; reported its first human case in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, most people infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some may have mild illness with flu-like symptoms, such as fever with headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. The CDC says most people with mild illness recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a higher risk for severe illness for older adults or those with certain chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Trumbull County Combined Health District is reminding the community to stay vigilant against being bitten by mosquitoes by wearing insect repellent, wearing long sleeves or pants outside and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito biting hours. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The district also advises other precautions to prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home, such as emptying standing water from items such as flowerpots, buckets and tarps, replacing pets’ water dishes frequently and unclogging roof gutters.&lt;/p&gt;

It found that short energy bursts – a median of just 1.1 minutes per day of brief, vigorous effort – was linked with a lower risk of death over roughly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was simple. People who racked up about five or six energy bursts per day, each usually around 10 seconds and all under one minute, tended to fare better than those who did none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was led by Emmanuel Stamatakis at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The team focused on vigorous activity, meaning effort that makes breathing hard and raises heart rate clearly for short spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at death from any cause. The curve of benefit rose quickly at low amounts, then flattened, which means the biggest change showed up when going from zero to a little. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is important for people who find it hard to schedule &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-can-slow-aging-right-down-to-your-dna/"&gt;workouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample came from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHANES&lt;/a&gt; (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), a long-running U.S. program that links health records with device-measured movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore a wrist accelerometer – a sensor that records motion dozens of times per second – for about a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors studied what they call Vigorous Intermittent Lifestyle Physical Activity (&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VILPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the short, sharp effort that happens during normal life, like a very fast walk uphill, a quick run to catch a bus, or carrying heavy items up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-short-energy-bursts-mean"&gt;What short energy bursts mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two findings stood out. First, daily time VILPA showed a near-linear link with lower risk, and the median of 1.1 minutes per day corresponded to a hazard ratio of about 0.61 in models that accounted for many other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, doing roughly five to six short bursts per day captured most of the observed benefit in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VILPA is a bit like applying the principles of High &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-feels-better-when-its-matched-to-your-personality/"&gt;Intensity&lt;/a&gt; Interval Training to your everyday life,” Stamatakis explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to further investigate this link through robust trials, but it appears that VILPA may be a promising, cost free recommendation for lowering cancer risk in people who find structured exercise difficult or unappealing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-with-other-studies"&gt;Comparing with other studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier U.K. Biobank &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; reported that a sample median of 4.4 minutes per day of VILPA was associated with noticeably lower risks of all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. study’s median dose is smaller, which may reflect differences in age, fitness, or baseline activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer findings from the U.K. Biobank add useful context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of non-exercisers found that about 4.5 minutes per day of VILPA was linked to lower incident cancer risk, with the steepest gains when moving from none to a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hazard ratio compares rates of an outcome between groups over time. Values below 1.0 indicate a lower rate in the more active group, values above 1.0 indicate a higher rate, and the confidence interval shows the range of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers do not prove that short energy bursts caused the lower risk. They show a strong association after adjusting for many measured factors, which is informative for public health while we wait for further trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-bursts-and-health"&gt;Energy bursts and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about one quarter of U.S. adults meet both aerobic and strength targets, notes a CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db443.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding health linked to very short, vigorous effort embedded in daily life could help reach people who are not hitting those goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal shows up at low doses. That matters because many people cite time, cost, or access as barriers to regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. cohort’s median VILPA time was just over a minute per day, and the median burst count was about five per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most bursts lasted around 10 seconds, which aligns with the way people actually move when life gets busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose-response curve rose quickly at first, then flattened around eight bursts per day in this dataset. That pattern supports the idea that small, repeatable effort may offer a meaningful step up from doing none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-bursts-and-future-health"&gt;Energy bursts and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable sensors let scientists capture movement in 10-second windows, which makes it possible to study these micro patterns. That is a big advance over older surveys that missed very short efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials need to test whether nudging VILPA upward changes health markers directly. Those tests could use prompts during chores, commuting, or short work breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an observational analysis, so unmeasured differences could still explain part of the link. People who feel better might move more, and some health risks are hard to measure perfectly at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Device limits matter too. Wrist sensors can misread certain tasks, and any single week of tracking may not reflect a person’s full year of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health groups already say that all &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-form-of-exercise-is-shown-to-improve-sleep-the-most-according-to-studies/"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; counts. VILPA adds a sharp, practical edge to that message by focusing on brief, intense efforts that do not require special gear or set times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ongoing work shows cause and effect, simple cues could help people add a handful of short energy bursts to tasks they already do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of shift would be especially useful for those who do not visit gyms or prefer not to schedule workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.05.25333017v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;medRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 20:44:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNNDFXcE1zenBLX0doVVZCU1AtcnR5VVpPdFFfaGNCY3ZlRjZWanFRVjBvV0d4NEJDM2lSeC1YNzd1b05CSGNXZzJsT3VQclJIUnVmbG9iZk1mZC16ZTNHNWtKdGZGZFd3aW9GcnNNVTR5NUZQYXpLVkJueWJJMnlIbVI1NTktMi1ONGg5Wmo0TzlCblJlSTdhYkMzRU9YXy1wRE44SUtrMTlVT2xnTlpOQw</guid></item><item><title>我是一名流行病学家。我有关于结肠癌新研究的坏消息。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/colon-cancer-vegetables-broccoli-study-debunk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001b3b794ifppqum@published"&gt;There’s an old joke about the Daily Mail&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that is timeless: The tabloid likes to categorize every substance known to humankind as either a cause or cure of cancer. There was even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4abk9fd_lR4"&gt;a song&lt;/a&gt; put out by the BBC 15 years ago making fun of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001c3b79vrcd36na@published"&gt;The problem is that it’s not just the Daily Mail. In reality, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; love stories about causing or preventing cancer, so much so that most media sources are guilty of misrepresenting the evidence that appears in the many cancer-related studies published each year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duo001d3b79d40wkf9p@published"&gt;The latest series of articles is a wonderful example. A recent scientific publication has come out noting that there is a relationship between the intake of cruciferous vegetables—a large group that includes everything from broccoli to bok choi—and a reduced risk of colon cancer. The media &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/health/lower-colorectal-cancer-risk-by-20-by-eating-more-of-this-food/"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;, predictably, &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/risk-of-colon-cancer-slashed-by-eating-specific-types-of-vegetables-study-finds/ar-AA1La8YK"&gt;gone wild&lt;/a&gt;. If you believe the headlines, it would mean that we can slash our risk of a really nasty form of cancer with just a few florets of cauliflower a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="22" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001e3b793uqd19v6@published"&gt;Sadly, as an epidemiologist, I can tell you that the data are not nearly strong enough to draw such a meaningful conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001f3b7953t3ol9n@published"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9#Sec2"&gt;The new study&lt;/a&gt; is a systematic review of observational research. Observational research in this context means that scientists ask people what they eat, and then look at whether the foods they consume are linked to their long-term risk of cancer. A systematic review is a type of study that aggregates all of the studies on a topic and then combines them into a single analysis of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001g3b797tyfm5rs@published"&gt;In this case, if you look at all of the observational research on cruciferous vegetables and colon cancer, it appears that people who eat more of the veggies have less cancer. The highest levels of veggie-munching were associated with a 17 percent reduction in colon cancer risk across 17 studies compared to eating no cruciferous vegetables at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dup001h3b796d2nv3sy@published"&gt;The problem here is with that word &lt;em&gt;association. &lt;/em&gt;Thanks to this study and the predecessors it aggregates, we can say with some certainty that if you ask large groups of people what they eat, the people who say that they eat more broccoli each week are less likely to get colon cancer as time goes on. But what does that really mean?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duq001i3b79lpngcr7m@published"&gt;It’s very hard to know from studies like this whether eating more of the vegetables actually causes improved health or whether there is some other factor going on that isn’t measured properly in the study. People regularly lie on surveys about what they eat, or they forget and make mistakes. People who eat more vegetables are systematically different from people who eat fewer veggies, in ways that are hard to control for in studies like this. It might just be that rich people have more access to vegetables and are less likely to get cancer because they exercise more, or have less exposure to known carcinogens, rather than anything specific to cabbage or Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745duq001j3b79t8v8qj1k@published"&gt;The authors of this systematic review did try to account for some of these issues, but a fundamental problem with large nutrition studies that simply ask people what they eat is that it’s really hard to eliminate the problems entirely. That’s why we run randomized clinical trials, which can account for all of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001k3b79obo3nkwh@published"&gt;Or, to quote the authors of the new review: “This meta-analysis suggests a potential inverse association between higher CV [cruciferous vegetables] intake and CC [colon cancer] incidence. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to methodological limitations.” This is basically science-speak for: “We don’t know if broccoli prevents cancer or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001m3b79uww689u4@published"&gt;This feels like just another case of the media blowing unimportant findings way out of proportion. Yes, there is some association between broccoli and good health, but we already knew that. There are probably dozens, if not hundreds, of diseases where you could find some positive association like this, but in my humble opinion, that news isn’t interesting or useful to your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001n3b79a9r72waq@published"&gt;When it comes to the question of individual foods causing or curing cancer, I don’t think we’ll ever have good answers. Even for red meat—which has been researched for decades—there’s no clear proof of a cancer link.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf745dur001o3b790cngor5i@published"&gt;It’s definitely true that your diet as a whole can raise or lower your risk of various diseases, but when it comes to specific foods, the evidence is much murkier. Don’t start spooning up coleslaw because you think it’ll stop you from getting cancer. If you like cabbage, eat &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It found that the drug alleviated symptoms in many patients for at least three months after just one exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8f392896-0bcd-42db-9c37-be05cc8d4b8a-2"&gt;That said, participants who were given low doses of LSD — either 25 or 50 micrograms — did not see a significant change in their symptoms. The effect kicked in only at higher doses — either 100 or 200 micrograms — and those given 100-microgram doses had the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e91f004e-a6ce-4417-b25a-5c76d16bad33"&gt;In fact, 12 weeks out from treatment, about 47% of the people who were given 100 micrograms were in remission, based on a standardized anxiety rating scale. And about 65% of the people in that group saw their scores on the scale fall by at least half. By comparison, only about 20% of the placebo group was in remission at the 12-week mark and about 30% saw their scores halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This work has the potential to make significant contributions to the emerging field of psychedelic drug research," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://psychiatry.queensu.ca/directory/faculty-gft/claudio-soares" target="_blank" data-url="https://psychiatry.queensu.ca/directory/faculty-gft/claudio-soares" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claudio Soares&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at the Queen's University School of Medicine in Ontario, wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838509" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838509" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;commentary about the trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's the first study to examine how different doses of LSD compare with a placebo for relieving anxiety. In addition, the trial didn't explicitly incorporate psychotherapy into the treatment, meaning it could help pin down whether LSD in and of itself has an anti-anxiety effect, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, the study highlighted an early response to treatment and positive effects on comorbid depressive symptoms, both of which are promising findings that should guide future trials," Soares said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/one-psychedelic-psilocybin-dose-eases-depression-for-years-study-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/one-psychedelic-psilocybin-dose-eases-depression-for-years-study-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 psychedelic psilocybin dose eases depression for years, study reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are approved anti-anxiety drugs, not all patients respond to them, the trial runners noted in their report. Estimates suggest about 50% of patients do not have an adequate response to first-line anxiety treatments, such as benzodiazepines or serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, which are also used for depression).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, there's still a need for more effective, well-tolerated anti-anxiety medicines, the trial runners argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter LSD. The psychedelic is thought to trigger its mind-altering effects — such as visual hallucinations and a feeling of being high — in part by enabling communication &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/lsd-breaks-down-barriers-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/lsd-breaks-down-barriers-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between brain cells that don't normally interact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's thought that this action might trigger a period of enhanced plasticity in the brain, during which a person with anxiety could break out of the harmful thought patterns that characterize the condition. But this mechanism is not fully understood and is still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials that have combined LSD with psychotherapy hinted that the drug can have a positive and sustained effect in treating anxiety. But because these trials were testing two interventions — LSD plus therapy — it's hard to know what LSD was contributing on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial aimed to investigate that question by including people who were not undergoing psychotherapy. In all, 18% of the participants were receiving external psychotherapy when they entered the study and continued receiving therapy during the study, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the 194 participants scored an average of 30 on an anxiety scale from 0 to 56, where the threshold for "severe" anxiety is 24. A score of 7 or less indicates remission. Patients given the 100-microgram dose saw, on average, a 21-point drop in their scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A treatment effect emerged 1 day after the dosing day and persisted through week 12," the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of side effects tied to the treatment were expected and resolved once the dosing of the drug concluded. These effects included visual perception changes, nausea, headache and euphoric mood. Notably, side effects were reported across all the study groups, including the placebo group, but occurred at the highest rates in the high-dose groups. For instance, more than 90% of the 100-microgram group reported hallucinations, as did 100% of the 200-microgram group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people reported "feeling intoxicated" in the 50- and 100-microgram groups, respectively, but felt normal by the end of the dosing session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f9e93fdf-f449-4954-8364-af70d7cf6ddd"&gt;Although the side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity, they did prompt a handful of people to drop out of the trial, so the LSD treatment may not be tolerable to all patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial does have some limitations, including the short follow-up time of only three months and the inclusion of some patients who still underwent therapy during the trial, Soares said. But in all, the trial provides crucial data that could help "further inform regulatory pathways for the use of psychedelic drugs as stand-alone treatments," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will be needed to evaluate how well the effects of the drug last over longer time frames, particularly after a single dose, he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ-HkDh9ROmyus8P3dO4FDwjr3l1hfqyjID" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-qkAxjdFB3UdbJ4gWyzeJGJ-HkDh9ROmyus8P3dO4FDwjr3l1hfqyjID slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Mittler said they got their Covid shots Thursday after the pharmacist said Medicare had updated the system there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9aade" class="body-graf"&gt;Their experiences are at odds with remarks from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-bipartisan-pushback-senate-hearing-moves-limit-vaccines-rcna229131" target="_blank"&gt;who told a Senate committee on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that most Americans are going to be able to get a Covid shot from their pharmacy for free. As HHS secretary, Kennedy oversees Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5acbcb" class="body-graf"&gt;Late last month, Kennedy announced that the FDA had approved updated Covid shots for the fall, but for a smaller, high-risk group: People 65 and up and those with underlying medical conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-363d84" class="body-graf"&gt;The limited approval&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-fall-covid-shots-may-come-copays-no-coverage-rcna226160" target="_blank"&gt; raised concerns about access&lt;/a&gt; for people outside the high-risk groups, but not for those eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b95ec4" class="body-graf"&gt;“Anybody can get the booster,” he told members of the Senate Finance Committee, when pressed about the limited eligibility. “Most Americans will be able to get it from their pharmacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-600805" class="body-graf"&gt;Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said if eligible patients are having trouble getting the vaccine, it heightens his concerns about limited access to vaccines under shifting policies from Kennedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f83aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“Medicare should be covering the shots, but it isn’t clearing people,” Caplan said. “So again, this just stirs up uncertainty about, ‘OK, am I eligible? Am I in the risk group?’ People still aren’t sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16c058" class="body-graf"&gt;The updated Covid shots began arriving at major pharmacy chains last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c56b28" class="body-graf"&gt;But some &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delayed-vaccine-meeting-shifting-policies-make-difficult-people-get-co-rcna228055" target="_blank"&gt;say they’re holding off in certain states&lt;/a&gt; until the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee issues its own recommendation on eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-829847" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices typically meets earlier in the summer to make its Covid vaccine recommendation. This year, the group isn’t scheduled to meet until Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6fa6c" class="body-graf"&gt;Medicare, however, doesn’t need to wait for CDC’s sign-off. Once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-882e72" class="body-graf"&gt;CVS, one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, said that in 13 states and Washington, D.C., everyone, including Medicare patients, will need a doctor’s prescription until ACIP issues its recommendations — and even then, eligibility will depend on age. In three states — Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico — CVS won’t be offering the Covid shot at all until ACIP acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0deef5" class="body-graf"&gt;“A few payers are still updating their systems and may not yet be set up to cover the updated Covid-19 vaccines,” CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said when asked about some Medicare patients who were told the vaccine wasn’t covered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976417" class="body-graf"&gt;“If this happens, our pharmacy teams can help patients schedule an appointment for a later date,” Thibault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c4184" class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7aaee2" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in an emailed statement that the agency was looking into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f2ded" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“CMS continues to monitor developments related to COVID-19 vaccines,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 19:56:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPMXdfYTJvcFJTcUNnelhVTWswbVRLWmVpYkttaHhxaExscG5ZYXBuVVAzLU9POXYtNll4c2FtT3pGelYtSWI5TkJ3aUhoYVlTQVhZZklYdXpDOG1FNk1BbFduUHFpbGJLcDRhY0M3cW9CbVBpWEptV3k0dTl1SDR4amNFcEV4TndBQWsyZWk1VmdrM3N0WjJOcHlfV0tPSFZreWxJ0gFWQVVfeXFMUEpnUzFnbHZQSXNfdjl5VEN1VWdwSjBYeEo2bHg1OC1McS1GQkxMaEtiVFBNdHlXMUtHYTlUcGYzWExMTTVWbnNCclVtSVlRYmRuWlY4SXc</guid></item><item><title>在德克萨斯州奶牛群中检测到H5N1 ；研究人员无法确定加利福尼亚儿童疾病的来源- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n1-detected-texas-dairy-herd-researchers-cant-pinpoint-source-california</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a month with no H5N1 avian flu detections in dairy cattle, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a positive test involving a herd from Texas, raising the nation's total since early 2024 to 1,079 infected herds in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection is Texas's first since May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, APHIS reported another H5N1 outbreak at a commercial turkey farm, the second recent detection in South Dakota. The new report involves a facility in Beadle County that houses 52,600 birds. Other outbreaks in turkeys over the past week occurred in flocks in Faulk County, South Dakota, and in Dickey County, North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Source of California child's H5N1 infection still a mystery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related news, investigators from California and their partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday published their investigation findings into &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/san-francisco-reports-h5n1-avian-flu-child"&gt;one of two&lt;/a&gt; unexplained H5N1 infections in California children. They published the details in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7433a2.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school-age child's symptoms included fever, muscle pain, abdominal pain, and conjunctivitis ("pink eye"). They began on December 13, 2024, lasting 1 week and involving two healthcare visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first visit was at a local emergency department, where staff collected a nasopharyngeal sample that tested positive for influenza A and was sent to the San Francisco Department of Public Health's lab as part of enhanced surveillance. Further subtyping identified H5N1 on January 9, and follow-up sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the B3.13 genotype that had been circulating in dairy cattle, other mammals, poultry, and wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other family members had been sick, and polymerase chain reaction and serology testing of some of the child's close contacts revealed no evidence of human-to-human spread. A sample collected from the child on January 10 was still positive, but specimens collected 4 days after that were negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Poultry not likely the cause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family lived in an urban environment and had a pet dog. A family member had bought raw poultry at a live-bird market more than 2 weeks before the child's symptoms began. It was cooked and eaten the same day. Investigators wrote that poultry wasn't the likely source, given that poultry-market testing was negative, the child wasn't exposed to raw poultry, and the parents weren't sick. The investigators said the child spent time outdoors at school and may have had environmental exposure to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said continued surveillance and real-time subtyping at public health labs is a key part of novel flu surveillance and that detection of B3.13 serves as a reminder that the virus continues to transmit across susceptible species, requiring a strong One Health approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Especially if symptoms last longer than two weeks, oncologists would rather have you see a doc and err on the side of caution. “We don't take any chances, and we investigate thoroughly to make sure that we're taking the best care of people possible,” says Marla Lipsyc-Sharf, MD, an oncologist at UCLA Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are those symptoms an oncologist would want to investigate? They shared the top ones below. Keep in mind: Everything on this list can be explained by plenty of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; conditions, many of which are benign. Having one of them doesn’t mean you have cancer—it just means that it’s worth getting an all-clear from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/marla-lipsyc-sharf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marla Lipsyc-Sharf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marla Lipsyc-Sharf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a breast medical oncologist at UCLA Health. &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/despina-siolas-md-phd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Despina Siolas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Despina Siolas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/physicians/21461-thomas-buchholz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Buchholz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thomas Buchholz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of Scripps Cancer Center in San Diego, California. &lt;a href="https://siteman.wustl.edu/doctor/premal-thaker-md-ms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Premal H.

Thaker, MD, the chief of gynecologic oncology at the WashU Medicine Siteman Cancer Center. If all benign reasons are ruled out, the next step is to get a Pap test to screen for cervical cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Change In Bowel Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Colorectal cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; is "on the rise in younger people for reasons that we don't quite understand,” says Despina Siolas, MD, an oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, so it’s important to take any changes in bowel habits seriously (and to remember to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65566865/fiber-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat enough fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eat enough fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding that persists for greater than two weeks are among potential warning signs. A change in bowel habits is also a possible sign of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65914070/ovarian-cancer-detection-research/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ovarian cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are incredibly vague (think bowel changes, bloating, changes in urination, and feeling full quickly), Dr. Thaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changing bowel habits aren’t just indicative of cancer. Many women struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65783485/hypnotherapy-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and other related illnesses—all of which warrant a visit to your doc. So no matter what, it’s important to bring those symptoms to someone to get checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Unexplained Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[If] you're losing more than 10 pounds, and you don't understand why, that's usually a sign that something is wrong,” says Dr. Siolas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re experiencing weight loss over the course of a few weeks or a longer period of time, if it’s unexplained, it’s a potential red flag. “Adults don’t lose weight without trying pretty hard to do so,” says Therese Bartholomew Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “So, it could be a 10-pound weight loss over a one month period or a six month period, but the individual was not trying to lose weight and had not changed their diet. Both are a concern to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If weight loss is cancer-related, it could be because the tumor is taking up valuable vitamins and nutrients from the rest of the body, but weight loss could also be attributed to many benign conditions, like hyperthyroidism, which is caused by your body producing too much thyroid hormone. Having a gluten intolerance could lead to malabsorption, which could also cause weight loss, says Steve Lo, MD, the director of medical oncology at the Bennett Cancer Center at Stamford Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Unexplained Weight Gain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, “if you have unexplained weight gain in your abdomen accompanied by discomfort, that's also a sign that maybe there's something that needs to be checked out,” says Dr. Siolas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone with cancer that originates in the abdomen is experiencing weight gain, it’s usually related to fluid retention, says Dr. Siolas. That’s because the early stages of a tumor can attract a lot of fluid and cause bloating, which is why it may appear you’re gaining weight in the abdomen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Persistent Pain In Your Abdomen Or Pelvis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have persistent pain around your pelvis or abdomen, your first step is to head to the gyno for a pelvic exam. It’s a symptom that could be indicative of a number of issues, including painful periods, pain after sex, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850931/halsey-endometriosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:endometriosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64688867/pcos-weight-loss-workout-strength-transformation-improve-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polycystic ovary syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr. Thaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases though, pelvic pain could be a symptom of endometrial cancer. Screening for endometrial cancer typically involves a biopsy or dilation and curettage (D&amp;amp;C) she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have PCOS, there’s good reason to pay close attention. “PCOS is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, but it is unclear exactly how,” Dr. Thaker says. Some research suggests premenopausal women who have PCOS are around five times more at risk for endometrial cancer, according to a 2023 meta-analysis published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10028221/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oncology Letters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Oncology Letters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Enlarged Lymph Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lymph nodes can be found all over the body—from the neck, to the underarms, to the groin area. When lymph nodes are enlarged, the most common cause is actually inflammation or a viral or bacterial infection, says Dr. Lo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, swollen lymph nodes—especially ones that persist for more than two weeks—should raise some red flags, says Dr. Thaker. They could be indicative of a variety of cancers, including lymphoma or carcinoma, says Dr. Lo. Though there are exceptions, “cancerous lymph nodes tend to be hard, [while] reactive lymph nodes tend to be soft and tender,” Dr. Lo describes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Changes In The Skin Of Your Breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness, swelling, warmth, and/or dimpled skin on your breasts (resembling the appearance of an orange peel), are symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)—a condition that mimics the appearance of a breast infection, says Thomas Buchholz, MD, the medical director of Scripps Cancer Center. “It's a more aggressive form of breast cancer that is commonly diagnosed because the patient themselves notices a change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, more often than not, color changes on the breasts are actually caused by a rash. “Fungal infections are very common under the breast, especially in the summertime, when people are getting good, sweaty workouts in,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. At that point, a doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal cream or medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the area and color change persist for more than a week, and the root cause is determined not to be fungal, your doctor might recommend imaging for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;A New Lump That’s Not Going Away &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump feels ominous, and without the help of a biopsy, it’s often tricky to differentiate between a cancerous lump, and something less serious (such as an enlarged lymph node), says Dr. Thaker. But some reassurance: “Oftentimes, the lumps that we find are benign,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. Still, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t head to your doctor to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I usually recommend to my patients, my friends, and my family is when they first notice something, make a note in their calendar for two weeks from now,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. After two weeks, if the same lump is still there, contact your primary care doctor to schedule an appointment for a physical exam to determine if you need imaging of that area, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the lump is located in your breast, your provider can recommend the best breast screening plan for you, which likely includes a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62489379/mammogram-screening-guidelines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mammogram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mammogram&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly an ultrasound, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Persistent Breast Tenderness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33806639/inflammatory-breast-cancer-mastitis-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breast tenderness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;breast tenderness&lt;/a&gt; in both breasts in pre-menopausal women is hormonal fluctuations (a.k.a. your period), says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf. That’s why she always encourages patients to monitor their symptoms over the course of a couple of weeks to see if that tenderness persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty common to experience breast tenderness during certain points of your menstrual cycle, especially if you’re experiencing it on both sides, says Dr. Thaker. But if the tenderness is still there after a few weeks, and doesn't seem to be fluctuating in tune with your hormonal changes, bring it up with a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Nipple Bleeding Or Discharge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nipple bleeding and discharge can sometimes occur during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and could be as simple &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/non-cancerous-breast-conditions/intraductal-papillomas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as a papilloma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as a papilloma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a wart-like growth that develops within your milk ducts, per the ACS. But rarely, this symptom could be indicative of breast cancer, says Dr. Buchholz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing nipple bleeding or discharge, regardless of whether you’re pregnant, you should seek care. “Still, [patients] should know that more often than not, these are benign changes rather than cancerous changes,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Coughing Or Shortness Of Breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lingering cough or shortness of breath could arise from your run-of-the-mill cold, infection, allergies, environmental exposures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma. But they’re also two baseline symptoms of lung cancer, says Saiama N. Waqar, a professor of medicine at WashU Medicine and medical oncologist at the WashU Medicine Siteman Cancer Center. If these symptoms continue for more than two weeks, and you’re unsure why, it’s time to see a doctor, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest risk factor [for lung cancer] is &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65615034/drunk-cigarettes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cigarette smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cigarette smoking&lt;/a&gt;—and that still remains the case,” says Dr. Waqar. Still, between 10 and 20 percent of lung cancer cases occur in people who have never smoked or had fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,2%2C900%20of%20these%20lung%20cancers." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your cough reaches the point where you’re seeing blood, you’ll need to be seen more urgently, says Dr. Waqar. Coughing up blood isn’t a universal symptom of lung cancer, but a tumor sitting in your main airway could lead to it. This symptom could also be caused by something more benign (but still serious) like pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Being More Tired Than Usual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a37622303/lyme-disease-chronic-fatigue-misdiagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Feeling chronically fatigued;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Feeling chronically fatigued&lt;/a&gt; could be caused by several things, including endocrine disorders, psychiatric issues (like depression), kidney concerns, and heart, lung, and bowel absorption problems, Dr. Lo says. That said, “cancer &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cause fatigue, and again, that's the challenge that the primary care physician has,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy is a complicated biological process, and everyone will have a different baseline as to what qualifies as fatigue, but if you're having noticeable changes in your energy level or ability to do things, that's a sign you need to talk to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if you don’t have any of these symptoms, don’t skip your screenings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cancer, there might not be any signs at all—and that’s where screening comes in. “Screening is so important because it actually can detect cancer at a very early stage, such that it does not become a long term problem,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching cancer earlier via screening means that you’ve hopefully caught it at “a more curable stage of the disease,” says Dr. Buchholz. “Over 90 percent of people survive breast cancer, and the survival is very dependent on the stage of the disease or detecting it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, if you’re someone with a family history of cancer, you might be recommended to get screenings even earlier than others. Doctors can actually estimate your risk of cancer using the health information you provide, and then give you a more tailored screening plan. “Knowing your risk can help to find cancers even when there are no symptoms present,” says Dr. Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 18:40:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBmVHFNTjlwQnh3ckZJMFRmWGZ4SE1JRldSN05aQ0NYVGRXcTRpY21PQi1hWTFKTllvWmNzZlV4a3RzRkQxbUxtQ3dtOWIxUE41RE5BbFhhQU04VE9sUGNtZnBlUWUzWThvRGlPT2xtWHk5X1JsRmJIcV9fQQ</guid></item><item><title>“疯狂” ：医生认为9岁女孩怀孕了，但发现头发和牙齿在她体内生长-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-thought-woman-was-pregnant-and-found-teeth-and-hair-inside/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Bulgarian-born &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valentina Milanova&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who featured in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forbes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;2023 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;30 under 30 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;, has opened up about her childhood ordeal with an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;undiagnosed condition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; that had her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;menstruating &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;three years earlier than the average female.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To make matters worse, she knew nothing about the monthly cycle, nor that it visited regularly for the better part of a healthy woman’s life, and aside from being embarrassed, the 9-year-old believed she was slowly succumbing to some terrible disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="post-highlights"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Valentina Milanova had her first period at age nine and hid it from her parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors mistakenly believed she was pregnant before discovering a massive ovarian cyst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was later diagnosed with PCOS and struggled with debilitating symptoms for years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was not incorrect for thinking there was something wrong with her. But for all their knowledge, doctors misunderstood her situation to the point that they thought she was pregnant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this was despite her assertions that she had not yet been with a male. A pregnancy test vindicated her, and what doctors found has since been dubbed “a gynecologic health horror story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valentina Milanova had her first period at

They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A new drug – baxdrostat – can significantly lower blood pressure in these people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results of the BaxHTN study showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than the placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were also exciting discoveries about existing drugs that could help heart patients, delegates were told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;In one trial&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes. A new analysis of seven clinical trials showed patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared with those taking aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/weight-loss-drugs-can-halve-heart-patients-risk-of-early-death-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;A second study showed&lt;/a&gt; weight loss drugs may halve the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="diet-and-exercise" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;2. &lt;/span&gt;Diet and exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eating foods rich in potassium, such as avocados, bananas and spinach, could reduce your risk of heart conditions, hospitalisation and death by 24%, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/potassium-rich-diet-may-cut-risk-of-heart-failure-by-24-per-cent-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Danish researchers told the conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous research had shown that cutting out salt from meals can slash your risk of heart problems. A new study showed just how much potassium, which increases the amount of salt your body removes from the bloodstream, could help to ward off cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not a fan of spinach? Pulses, fish, nuts and seeds are also good sources of potassium, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exercise is also key to a healthy heart. It can lower your resting blood pressure and heart rate, improve your cholesterol levels, and help you maintain a healthy weight, which in turn reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Madrid, doctors heard about another potential benefit of getting active: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mending a broken heart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="artificial-intelligence" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors have developed &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/30/doctors-ai-stethoscope-heart-disease-london" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an artificial intelligence-led stethoscope&lt;/a&gt; that can detect three heart conditions in 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two centuries after the invention of the humble stethoscope, a team at Imperial College London and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust have designed a hi-tech upgrade. It analyses tiny differences in heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and takes a rapid ECG at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool’s AI capabilities mean it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early diagnosis of these three heart conditions is critical. The AI stethoscope enables patients who need life-saving treatment to be spotted sooner, before they become dangerously unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, a revolutionary AI scanning system is increasing the number of stroke patients avoiding serious disability, tripling the rate of recovery, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/stroke-centres-in-england-given-ai-tool-that-will-help-50-of-patients-recover" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;delegates were told&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And a new generative AI tool – ESC Chat – is &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress/Congress-news/ai-innovations-in-cardiology-navigating-the-path-to-wider-integration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;transforming the work&lt;/a&gt; of cardiologists worldwide.

&lt;/span&gt;Children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), which is typically genetic, is responsible for more than 10% of sudden cardiac deaths in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now a simple cheek-swab test can identify children with the condition, five years before they would normally be diagnosed, &lt;a

in Madrid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts at Great Ormond Street hospital and City St George’s, University of London are now developing the two-minute test into swab kits that can be used at home and sent away for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Elsewhere, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;doctors raised the alarm&lt;/a&gt; about high levels of vaping among children, saying they were convinced e-cigarettes were causing irreversible harm to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="vaccines" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;5. &lt;/span&gt;Vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination has increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Delegates at the conference were briefed about the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis of the shingles vaccine. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/28/shingles-vaccine-heart-cardiovascular-medical-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The results showed&lt;/a&gt; the jab could

Today,experts agree that statins are safe even in people with fatty liver disease or compensated cirrhosis, and they shouldn’t be withheld when heart benefits are expected. For kidneys, randomized evidence shows no clear increase in acute kidney injury with regular statin use. In fact, guidelines recommend them for most people with chronic kidney disease (except those on dialysis), since their cardiovascular risk is higher. However, a large observational &lt;a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/study-details-increased-risk-of-kidney-damage-with-rosuvastatin"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; linked high-dose rosuvastatin to small increases in hematuria or proteinuria, especially in advanced CKD. That’s why careful dosing is important in such patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生透露，卫生间习惯的改变可能表明您患有“沉默的癌症” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15069637/doctor-four-symptoms-silent-ovarian-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An oncologist has revealed the tell-tale signs of a 'silent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-01065f90-8a5a-11f0-841a-c977611f7b2a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;' she looks for in her own body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jamie Bakkum-Gamez, a gynecologic oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-fe4602e0-8a60-11f0-841a-c977611f7b2a"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that the warning signs of ovarian cancer are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14472951/GP-women-silent-signs-deadly-cancer.html"&gt;often subtle and easily mistaken&lt;/a&gt; for more benign conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in just a few months, it can grow from microscopic to infiltrating multiple organs at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads the disease, which affects 21,000 women in the US every year, to be dismissed and diagnosed at later, harder-to-treat stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, more than half of cases are diagnosed after they have already spread from the ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even Dr Bakkum-Gamez herself is at risk, as she's 49 years old and has never given birth. The ovaries stop producing protective hormones like estrogen and progesterone after &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-fe42ce90-8a60-11f0-841a-c977611f7b2a"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, which could increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, pregnancy stops ovulation, the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary into the fallopian tube. Ovulation creates inflammation in the ovary's surface, which could damage DNA and lead to tumor development over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because she could be more prone to developing ovarian cancer, Dr Bakkum-Gamez is especially vigilant about the subtle warning signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ovarian cancer often develops silently and causes vague, dismissed symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rachel Danchek of Pittsburgh (pictured at left) spent more than a year suffering from bloating and painful periods before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in her early 30s. Sports Illustrated model Bianca Balti (pictured right) was diagnosed with stage 3C ovarian cancer last year at age 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/ovarian-cancer-symptoms-doctor-monitors-in-herself-rcna228639"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'Every single day, I care for people with ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is clearly something that hits home to me. … It's definitely something that's always on my mind personally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ovarian cancer affects 21,000 US women every year and kills 12,700, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 55 percent of ovarian cancers are considered 'distant,' meaning they have spread to other areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer is diagnosed with a pelvic ultrasound or a blood test to measure tumor markers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, the survival rate after five years is 52 percent. While more than nine in 10 women with early-stage ovarian cancer survive, that rate dwindles to one in three if it spreads to surrounding organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women who are older, obese, have never had children or have a family history or genetic mutations are at the greatest risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When monitoring her own body, Dr Bakkum-Gamez takes quick notice of bloating, as this is one of the most common signs she sees in her own patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'People that come in with a new diagnosis say, "I thought I was just gaining weight because I was eating more," or "It didn't make sense as far as why I was gaining this weight."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Usually, their abdomen is looking more along the lines of what you would look like if you were pregnant.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ovarian tumors cause fluid to build up inside the abdomen, a phenomenon called ascites, leading it to become hard and swollen. Left untreated, the fluid can become infected and lead to multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percent of ovarian cancer cases by stage at diagnosis. The majority of cases are found after the disease has already spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the five-year survival rates for ovarian cancer based on stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bakkum-Gamez said she when feels bloated, she checks to see if she has extra fat she can grip with her hands outside of the tough parts. If not, it could be a sign of fluid buildup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Feeling full soon after eating, or early satiety, is another potential sign, as tumors or fluid accumulation can limit how much food the stomach can hold. It has also been linked to gastrointestinal conditions like gastroparesis and gastric obstructions, as well as stomach and colon cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Jamie Bakkum-Gamez, a gynecologic oncologist at the Mayo Clinic, is pictured above &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bakkum-Gamez told TODAY.com: 'If you're hungry and you eat a small amount of food, and you feel full pretty fast … that should prompt someone to be evaluated.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a mass in the pelvic area can keep the bladder from filling up all the way and holding as much urine, so Dr Bakkum-Gamez suggests frequent urination is another potential red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted 'it's not uncommon' for patients with ovarian cancer to get up three or four times at night to use the bathroom, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And any bowel habit changes like sudden constipation or diarrhea should immediately be checked out, she advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These may occur because ovarian cancer can travel on the surface of the lining of the abdomen and pelvis, which also covers the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ovarian cancer can also spread to the rectum, blocking normal bowel function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other signs of ovarian cancer include vaginal bleeding and abdominal or back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bakkum-Gamez said any of these symptoms that extend beyond a week or two should immediately be evaluated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:21:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQbnFtVkpod0FFRWUtV0dPeU04blU3aXhZWEtSZmhtMFQ1QklNeW9aRjBnR2pZVW5xcVFWajRYYWRFcUdyRTlVZ3ZEN0dGNWVHbEVKN0xRNDl4TmpxS2hnV2ZQY2NtbkhobmJ1MGRkMFhuNGx0ZjJEU1hxalNqZkVPM1JHcTJsQ1JlV3hJU1R6QmpUemtxeWpUZlNBcTZVNGhC0gGmAUFVX3lxTE93Z1ZfMHV0RlYzSUNZOXJxNEdpQlh0ZXBubnliN0pnYWEwQVdGb3drZW5YTTNTUDNLSUFpYUlybWhRRGtKczZXYktFRUhzeGdVbThjdW5SREVmNHJqcDkzOUlzZ2cyR2p3NGVwa2ZicWJNRExydEhWZWJQV2Item94WW9yNmFpejdMeWtaelozcWpVdjBkczFmNjhuYXBfUWxDRGRPdXc</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿州卫生官员建议更新所有6个月及以上的COVID-19疫苗- KING5.com</title><link>https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/washington-state-department-health-covid-19-shot/281-8111e01b-97d0-4d50-a981-aab796210c4c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Turning its back on the CDC, the Washington State Department of Health is recommending that everyone six months and older stay up-to-date on the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OLYMPIA, Wash. — The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) made its own official recommendation that everyone 6 months and older get the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is majorly expanded from what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/why-getting-a-covid-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-more-complicated-this-year/507-51c133c5-d658-4bfc-abe9-52ca6b01dce1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;handed down in late August&lt;/a&gt;, which restricted vaccine access to those 65 and older, or anyone 6 months and older with a condition that puts them at particular risk from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the DOH's first recommendation since Washington, Oregon, and California &lt;a href="/article/news/local/washington-oregon-california-west-coast-health-alliance-vaccine-recommendations-robert-f-kennedy-cdc/281-55a2fea5-8452-4191-8e1e-a8806622fa5e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;joined forces to issue their own vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, citing "recent federal actions that undermine the independence of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] CDC." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, an outspoken vaccine skeptic, swept the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) earlier this summer and replaced all members with his own appointees who hold similarly critical views on vaccination. ACIP is expected to meet in mid-September to issue its official recommendation as to who should get the COVID vaccine, and vaccines for hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States have historically aligned with the CDC's recommendation, but now many are following the West Coast's example by forming their own advisory bodies. The West Coast Health Alliance, which now includes Hawaii, is instead taking its guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states are striking out on their own. New York's Gov. Kathy Hochul announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/nyregion/covid-vaccine-hochul-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sign an executive order &lt;/a&gt;granting vaccine access to nearly anyone who wants it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential for limited vaccine supply in September&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington's Department of Health warned that appointments to get the COVID-19 vaccine may be limited because some providers are still waiting to receive their supplies of the updated vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOH's Childhood and Adult Vaccine programs are not currently available and may not be accessible until late September or October. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"DOH urges everyone to remain patient and vigilant in staying up to date on vaccinations," the agency wrote in a release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said the vaccine remains covered by most private insurers, by Apple Health (Washington's Medicaid program,) and Washington's Adult Vaccine and Childhood Vaccine programs, when they become available for the year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

He did not share specific data linking pediatric deaths to the vaccine, instead pointing to self reports in the FDA’s vaccine safety database. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Self-reported adverse events in the FDA’s vaccine database do not definitively prove that the person’s symptoms were caused by the vaccines. Makary’s comments, however, indicated that he thinks the reports are evidence enough. &lt;/p&gt;

That's far above the fatality rate for Covid, below one percent, measles, 10 percent for untreated patients, and Legionnaire's disease, also around 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis was effectively a death sentence in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was no cure, although it can now be prevented by vaccines and treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Officials said the three patients with active tuberculosis, meaning the bacteria is multiplying in their lungs, were in the Greater Portland area (shown above is a file photo of Portland, Maine)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis killed more than 16,000 people in the US every year in the 1950s, but deaths have now dropped 28-fold to around 550 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most tuberculosis cases in the US are imported or due to migration into the country, the CDC says, with most patients coming from outside America's borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further details on the Maine cases, including their names, ages and exact locations were not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state's CDC revealed the infections on Tuesday, and advised residents be aware of symptoms such as a persistent cough that does not ease within three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infections were described as active, suggesting bacteria was multiplying in patients' lungs, but when they started was not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they added that the risk to the general public was low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, warned that tuberculosis could only be passed on if someone was in 'close, prolonged contact' with an infectious person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/09/02/tuberculosis-cases-increase-in-maine-and-nation-but-no-current-outbreak/"&gt;Portland Press Herald&lt;/a&gt;: 'The vast majority of people do not need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The names and ages of the patients have not been revealed.

It's much less contagious than influenza or Covid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can take days for the disease to infect a healthy person who lives in the same home as a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Online reports had suggested the cases were linked to a shelter for asylum seekers in the area, but officials said there was no evidence that this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the cases are not yet an outbreak, which is defined as more cases than expected in a specific location or population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has already reported 28 cases of tuberculosis so far this year, figures show, just 11 cases below the 39 recorded in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were 26 cases reported in 2023. It wasn't clear whether this would be a record year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms of the disease include a persistent and unexplained cough and sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties, extensive lung damage and the infection may spread to other organs like the liver or back, causing pain in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients die from the disease due to respiratory failure, or when damage to the lungs means they can no longer get enough oxygen into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can treat the disease with antibiotics and can vaccinate against the disease using a shot called the BCG vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not routinely offered in the US, because the disease is not common, but can be requested for children, and leaves a small circular scar on the arm, a normal response and sign that the vaccine was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also be given to adults, but it is less effective in this group and may lead to someone falsely testing positive for the disease.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children under the age of 16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 15:35:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNbjdwN2ZUeTliRTdxVlhVT0cxVWpKQ05uTUVGMExNSVRjSmllandvRkFMQlR4RHA5SnpqWHdTT1dvSnpqbldxV0F1NFJCTWU4WE1ua0Vtd3F4LS1XQ0tKYTU2cUh2ek9OVzd6cG03V1NUU05vQUhyNVVDb29zazBLSUlGWUdUU0pVeGgxaV93czDSAZYBQVVfeXFMT2ZkNVVNUzhNSWJfdEFlOGZ1TG1DeDNwVVNJTjNTeHNkNS1CUzl1QXRIUmZfMmd3X3pSTHcwZE1JekItOGV1SmJJYjBfekpEWmVjUU15cm5oWVlxcnN4MHF5aUVJRDltWGUxdm8yWW9HNURudDc3X0MyRHRGbWZ1eG1jNGkteUxtTkEtT1NjQXctcFVLY3BR</guid></item><item><title>卫生机构表示， Mpox不再是紧急情况，但问题仍然存在-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mpox-no-longer-an-emergency-concerns-remain-health-body-says-2025-09-05/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 15:19:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxNT0l3R1pBR2pJZURxZldDTk11cnFlZVJfdzhua2NSdVlVUVQwUFJxeDdOSUdPd2YzQWYzeXRyeWlMTy1JSlpmZDdiSTZBSDhnenVkUzFUbXJpS0RNNWZVMEF6LWNyOWNBRmxRSWM1UGNpVE9iODJITHBjVlRiZlBQWWJvc1l3SUlXUUpSajY0c2VoVlM2U1I4aExTNF9DRWFrNjR4VW1OdGphWGQzd0xxa1doRHpwUlIxVGl2aEM1RFdSemUzYi1WSF8zVzA</guid></item><item><title>美国卫生部通过新的《常规条例》确认COVID-19疫苗地位-华盛顿州卫生部(.gov)</title><link>https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/doh-confirms-covid-19-vaccine-position-new-standing-order</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For immediate release&lt;/strong&gt;: September 5, 2025   (25-104)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Standing Order improves vaccine access for everyone 6 months and older&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;/strong&gt; – The &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/"&gt;Washington State Department of Health (DOH)&lt;/a&gt; issued a Standing Order for the COVID-19 vaccine, making it easier for Washington residents to get vaccinated. The order comes as DOH reaffirms its guidance that everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant people, should stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. This recommendation aligns with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“COVID-19 vaccines are well-researched, well-tested, and have saved millions of lives around the world,” said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, State Health Officer, DOH. “The barriers to COVID-19 vaccination are complex, and the Standing Order is just one part of the solution. We want to ensure all Washington residents have access to the protection these vaccines provide based on the best available science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing Order improves vaccine access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/COVID19VaccineStandingOrder.pdf"&gt;Standing Order&lt;/a&gt; allows most residents to go directly to a Washington pharmacy or clinic and receive the COVID-19 vaccine without an individual prescription. The vaccine remains covered by most private insurers, &lt;a href="https://wahealthplanfinder.org/us/en/tools-and-resources/information/find-answers/washington-apple-health.html"&gt;Apple Health&lt;/a&gt;, and Washington’s &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/public-health-system-resources-and-services/immunization/adult-vaccine-program"&gt;Adult Vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/public-health-system-resources-and-services/immunization/childhood-vaccine-program"&gt;Childhood Vaccine Programs&lt;/a&gt;, removing barriers and helping people stay healthy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Coast states unite in vaccine, public health guidance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standing Order follows Washington’s Sept. 3 announcement joining Oregon and California to form the &lt;a href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgovernor.wa.gov%2Fnews%2F2025%2Fwashington-california-and-oregon-launch-new-west-coast-health-alliance-uphold-scientific-integrity/1/01010199170b6196-06b0d2f9-c0aa-41be-b504-67b53d417ac6-000000/K7NrzyTCATAjXz96t_yPOYkRmD7JGuvKJqqQcqyX5XI=421"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgovernor.wa.gov%2Fnews%2F2025%2Fhawaii-join-west-coast-health-alliance-washington-california-and-oregon&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CRaechel.Sims%40doh.wa.gov%7C1bbf24e5257c4f07f5a508ddec64340a%7C11d0e217264e400a8ba057dcc127d72d%7C0%7C0%7C638926637335479572%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=TMqO41%2B1XYlkK7fpZnHayK0CpeB012ZPQWINqJqdWZg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;Hawaii joining the partnership&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 4. The Alliance is committed to using the best available science to guide public health decisions. It was created in response to recent federal actions that undermined the independence of the CDC and raised concerns about the politicization of science. Together, the three states will help ensure public health policies are informed by trusted scientists, clinicians, and other public health leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Washington State will not compromise when it comes to our values: science drives our public health policy,” said Dennis Worsham, Washington State Secretary of Health. “Our commitment is to the health and safety of our communities, protecting lives through prevention, and not yielding to unsubstantiated theories that dismiss decades of proven public health practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Washington will step up to protect our residents and ensure our policies are still based in rigorous science. We need the best science and knowledge available to protect public health. I will do everything in my power to protect Washingtonians and stand up for our values as a state," said Governor Bob Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect yourself and your community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some health care providers have already received the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine, other providers are still waiting to receive supplies of the updated vaccine, which may limit appointments. Supply through the Childhood and Adult Vaccine programs are not available yet, and may not be available until late September or October. DOH urges everyone to remain patient but vigilant in staying up to date on vaccinations. Ask your provider or local pharmacy when they expect to start offering COVID-19 vaccines for the season and prioritize making vaccination appointments for yourself and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the COVID-19 vaccine, talk to your provider or &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/immunization/diseases-and-vaccines/covid-19"&gt;visit DOH’s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yet obesity keeps climbing. Almost 40 percent of adults live with it today. Healthcare costs soar past $170 billion each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related diseases, including certain cancers, are rising too. If the answer were only diet and exercise, the trend would have reversed by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt; argue that something else is driving the epidemic. They point to stress, inequality, and life circumstances that change how the gut and brain work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These forces don’t just influence choices. They shape cravings, motivation, and biology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obesity-tied-to-social-pressures"&gt;Obesity tied to social pressures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new review, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/em&gt;, shows how social conditions affect obesity. Researchers call these conditions social determinants of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-childhood-obesity-rate-is-expected-to-soar-by-2050/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These includes income, education, neighborhood safety, healthcare access, childhood adversity, discrimination, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of them as the backdrop of daily life, where cheap food options dominate, streets feel unsafe, health care is hard to reach, and stress never fades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these pressures pushes the body toward weight gain, shaping how people eat, how much they move, and how they cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-microbes-influence-brain-cravings"&gt;Gut microbes influence brain cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body has a messenger system linking the gut to the brain. Microbes in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/obesity-is-linked-more-to-food-than-fitness/"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt; release signals. The brain responds with hormones and chemical shifts. Together, they steer appetite and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arpana Church, who co-directs the Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center, describes this loop as central. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reveal that tackling obesity requires more than focusing on individual choices – it demands recognizing the powerful role that social and environmental forces play in shaping gut health, behavior and long-term health outcomes,” said Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reversing the escalating obesity epidemic in America demands a dual approach – personalized, equitable care for individuals and bold, systemic policy reforms that address the root causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-fuels-obesity-patterns"&gt;Stress fuels obesity patterns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial stress shapes food choices. Families on tight budgets often buy processed meals because fresh produce costs more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food insecurity makes obesity more common in both adults and children. Stress hormones then reinforce those eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighborhoods also matter. Poorer areas often lack grocery stores, safe spaces, or healthcare. Violence and crime raise daily stress, pushing people toward food for comfort. Structural racism deepens the problem by concentrating disadvantage in certain communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-loneliness-changes-brain-responses"&gt;Loneliness changes brain responses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation adds another layer. People without strong social ties process &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fat-soaking-microbeads-could-be-the-next-weight-loss-breakthrough/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; cues differently. The brain becomes more sensitive to rewards, and food looks more tempting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the gut microbiome loses diversity. Inflammation rises and cravings grow stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research shows that social determinants of health – such as access to nutritious food, safe spaces for physical activity, access to resources such as education, grocery stores, and quality health care – are powerful drivers of obesity risk, underscoring the need to address the conditions in which people live, work and grow,” said Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-rewires-the-brain-and-body"&gt;Stress rewires the brain and body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress, poor diet, and discrimination don’t just change behavior – they rewire systems. Brain scans show less gray matter in areas that control motivation and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation lowers dopamine, reducing satisfaction from normal rewards. Harmful bacteria flourish in the gut, weakening metabolism and insulin response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racism-related stress leaves its mark too. Repeated exposure alters &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mind-over-matter-brain-boosting-diet-could-enhance-focus-in-children/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; networks that handle emotions and decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shifts gut chemistry, promoting inflammation. These biological changes make food an easy, almost automatic coping tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-childhood-stress-sets-obesity-patterns"&gt;Childhood stress sets obesity patterns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review shows that these effects start young. Stress during pregnancy changes fetal development. Children may inherit altered metabolic responses before they’re born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After birth, breastfeeding, antibiotics, and early diet shape the microbiome further. Breastfeeding can lower obesity risk in adolescents, especially in disadvantaged families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, ongoing stress and poor diet often outweigh those protections. By the time children reach school age, the patterns are set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Church emphasized that policy shifts are vital. Health care must expand. Schools need &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-foods-can-be-staged-to-look-more-appealing/"&gt;healthier meals&lt;/a&gt;, and neighborhoods need grocery stores and safe parks. But individuals can still act within limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing affordable nutritious food, keeping social connections, and practicing stress relief can all help. Walking outside, journaling, and gratitude exercises are simple tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, healthcare providers have a vital role to play, not only by screening for current social determinants of health, but also by recognizing how these factors accumulate and evolve over time, which is rarely accounted for in today’s clinical practice,” said Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mindfulness-and-therapy-show-promise"&gt;Mindfulness and therapy show promise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinics are trying new strategies. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tai-chi-reduces-inflammatory-risks-in-cancer-survivors/"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; helps people change eating habits. Mindfulness reduces stress-driven overeating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also testing probiotics and even fecal microbiota transplants to restore gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By understanding these influences and tailoring treatment plans to account for biological and psychosocial challenges, providers can offer more personalized plans that improve outcomes, empowers individuals to take control over their health,” noted Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: obesity is not only about food or exercise. It reflects stress, inequality, and biology shaped by the world outside. Until those pressures shift, the numbers won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1542356525007323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 14:40:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOVmFldjVEQ3VGcEI1RktkMU5abGxROXhXYWY0dzkyQk9xV3JNX3BrdTZIeGxLUTY4V3hJMkVxSkV0RG1XMlkyT0RVNC1iMjBuNHFxUnlYazdpNi1uWFdzYWRxbWdHazY3dGJ0MzEtcUN2WlExV3BEaWtKQ2J1QnJVQ3MzblExbnQyT3FBcS1McC1tVl9VZVg3Y3pTMGdtZw</guid></item><item><title>蓝光可能有助于去除食物和汗渍，不含刺激性化学物质-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/science/blue-light-stains-laundry.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 14:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5sVDlYWkQzeXRCYWEzRFV6VWZrWmdPbjlBYWtGVUtfWEF3LVFWQ2t0U0Y3LVc1OVU3MkVfSnZEaGlmWk92ejFBd05sLXhyUVp0WlV4TjZYczNVd2Q0MjEtZFZpTnZhUkY0TElHcF85VmZ6cjQ2UC10QUs1R0JXQQ</guid></item><item><title>糖尿病的希望： CRISPR编辑的细胞在人体内泵出胰岛素–并逃避免疫检测-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02802-5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_51421802.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_51421802.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured transmission electron micrograph of Islets of Langerhans from a human pancreas shown in pink, purple, cyan and orange colours" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_51421802.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Pancreatic islets (artificially coloured) no longer secrete sufficient insulin in people with type 1 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a medical first, researchers report that they have implanted &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04102-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04102-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;CRISPR-edited&lt;/a&gt; pancreas cells into a person with type 1 diabetes. The cells pumped out sugar-regulating insulin for months — without the need for the recipient to take immune-dampening drugs, thanks to gene edits that allowed the cells, collected from a deceased donor, to evade detection by the recipient’s immune system&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, orchestrated by the firm Sana Biotechnology in Seattle, Washington, raises hopes of an enduring cure for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;an autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt; that consigns millions of people to a life of strict monitoring and dependence on injected insulin. “The preliminary data has definitely lifted the spirits of our community — and it’s a really elegant approach”, says Aaron Kowalski, the chief executive of Breakthrough T1D, a non-profit organization in New York City formerly known as JDRF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00590-y" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_27719384.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Stealthy stem cells to treat disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to apply immune-cloaking gene edits to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02620-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02620-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and then direct their development into insulin-secreting islet cells. Unedited islets made from stem cells have already shown promise for treating type 1 diabetes in a small trial, according to results published in June&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some independent research groups have failed to confirm that the Sana method confers immune-skirting abilities on edited cells. And the study involved only one person who received a low dose of cells for a short time — not enough “to achieve insulin independence, so clinical efficacy remains unproven”, says Tim Kieffer, a molecular endocrinologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kieffer calls the demonstration of immune cloaking “convincing” and “a major milestone toward the goal of effective cell therapy without chronic immunosuppression”. Kieffer previously held the role of chief scientific officer at biotechnology company ViaCyte (that has since been acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts), which, like Sana, focused on developing cell therapies for type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stem-cell solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only way for someone with type type 1 diabetes to avoid dependence on injected insulin is through the transplantation of cadaveric islet cells. The procedure can restore insulin production for years, but it is rarely performed — constrained by the scarcity of donor pancreases and the need for lifelong immune-suppressing drug therapy, which carries risks of infection, cancer and other serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03357-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_27709654.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;‘Smart’ insulin prevents diabetic highs — and deadly lows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the donor shortage, some companies have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01842-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01842-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;stem-cell technologies to generate limitless supplies&lt;/a&gt; of replacement islets in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertex is furthest along. As reported in June, the company transplanted embryonic stem-cell-derived islets into 12 people with type 1 diabetes. After one year, ten participants no longer required insulin injections&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The company plans to seek regulatory approval for this cell therapy next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, scientists at regenerative-medicine company Reprogenix Bioscience in Hangzhou, China, are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03129-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03129-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;creating islets from reprogrammed stem cells&lt;/a&gt; derived from a recipient’s own fat tissue, with early reports of success&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Both approaches, however, still require recipients to take anti-rejection drugs, either to fend off immune attacks on donor cells or to counter the autoimmune assault that persists even against a person's own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stealth mode&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sana’s strategy aims to bypass the need for those drugs entirely. Company scientists began with islets from a deceased donor who did not have diabetes. Using CRISPR gene editing system, the researchers disabled two genes that normally help to flag foreign invaders to T cells, the immune system’s front-line defender. They then used a virus to shuttle genetic instructions for a protein called CD47 into the cells. This protein serves as a protective ‘do not eat me’ signal that prevents immune watchdogs, known as natural killer cells, from attacking the edited cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01080-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02802-5/d41586-025-02802-5_51420966.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain cells given an ‘invisibility cloak’ fix Parkinson’s symptoms in rats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Medicines for cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, haemophilia and blood-related disorders are among the other additions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO EML and EMLc include medicines for priority health needs of populations. They are adopted in over 150 countries, serving as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, reimbursement schemes. The revisions mark the 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of WHO EML and 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of EMLc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new editions of essential medicines lists mark a significant step toward expanding access to new medicines with proven clinical benefits and with high potential for global public health impact,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977 largely to promote better access to medicines in developing countries, the WHO Model Lists have become a trusted global policy tool for decisions related to the selection and universal coverage of medicines within all health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines reviewed 59 applications, including 31 proposals for the addition of new medicines or medicine classes. As a result, 20 new medicines were added to the EML and 15 to the EMLc, along with new use indications for seven already-listed products. The updated lists now include a total of 523 essential medicines for adults and 374 for children, reflecting the most pressing public health needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer medicines&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, claiming nearly 10 million lives each year and responsible for almost one in three premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases. Cancer treatments have been a major focus of the WHO EML for the past decade. With cancer medicines accounting today for about half of all new drug approvals by regulatory agencies, the Expert Committee applies rigorous criteria to recommend only those therapies that offer the greatest clinical benefit. As a result, few approved cancer medicines are included – only those proven to prolong life by at least 4-6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven applications encompassing 25 cancer medicines were evaluated. As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the Committee recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, a class of immunotherapy medicines that help the body’s immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Pembrolizumab was added to the EML as a first-line monotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For the latter, atezolizumab and cemiplimab are included as therapeutic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee also considered several expert-recommended strategies – highlighted in the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2025-eml-expert-committee/comments/cancer-expert-report.pdf?sfvrsn=41918b2d_1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;cancer experts report&lt;/a&gt; – aimed at improving access to and affordability of cancer treatments. It endorsed evidence-based clinical and health system strategies, including dose optimisation approaches, to improve access. The Committee emphasized that while health system reforms require time and government action, clinical strategies can be implemented immediately to deliver faster benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medicines for diabetes and obesity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. Over 800 million people were living with diabetes in 2022, with half going untreated. At the same time, more than 1 billion people worldwide are affected by obesity, and rates are rising especially fast in low- and middle-income countries. These two conditions are closely linked and can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Expert Committee reviewed strong scientific evidence showing that a group of medicines called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists can help people with type 2 diabetes – especially those who also have heart or kidney disease – by improving blood sugar control, reducing the risk of heart and kidney complications, supporting weight loss, and even lowering the risk of early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists – semaglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide – and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual receptor agonist (tirzepatide) have been added to the EML. They are used as glucose lowering therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease and obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This provides clear guidance to countries on which patients can benefit most from these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High prices of medicines like semaglutide and tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. Prioritizing those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care – especially in underserved areas – are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes. WHO will continue monitoring developments, support fair pricing strategies, and help countries improve access to these life-changing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A large share of out-of-pocket spending on noncommunicable diseases goes toward medicines, including those classified as essential and that, in principle, should be financially accessible to everyone,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO Director of Policy and Standards for Medicines and Health Products. “Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centred programmes that leave no one behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details of the Expert Committee’s recommendations, describing the additions, changes and removal of medicines and formulations, and decisions not to recommend medicines are available in the Executive Summary &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09544"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the 25th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines was held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, from 5 to 9 May 2025. The Expert Committee considered a total of 59 applications, assessing the scientific evidence on each medicine’s effectiveness, safety, comparative cost, and overall cost-effectiveness to inform its recommendations.

It was an implant that stimulates the brain, helping create new neurological pathways to improve muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CKL3GUQ7SBFERDTSUP32IMU7HQ"&gt;This April, Fello became the first patient at the Cleveland Clinic to receive the Vivistim System. Developed by the Texas-based company &lt;a href="https://www.microtransponder.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.microtransponder.com/"&gt;MicroTransponder,&lt;/a&gt; it combines stimulation of a major nerve with intensive physical therapy to help patients regain function in their hands and arms, even several years after a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PE5YFPGQEVFPJIASQQYOVPYWAU"&gt;Now Fello, 73, is able to walk around his home in Novelty, make oatmeal and wash the bowl — all things that were previously impossible for him to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZWO5XBPNPRE2TCJ5AV2RKGUXVY"&gt;“These are really minuscule things, but they’re gigantic mountains when you have a stroke,” Fello said. “I’m starting to show progress, and I’m very happy that I did it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XYPZZCWX3ZFJHGIYFRNATENZKM"&gt;The Clinic, one of the first Ohio hospitals to offer the Vivistim device, has treated about eight patients as of mid-August, said Dr. Mark Bain, cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at the Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JJCNGHWBFFER7A5TESYNMT4ZN4"&gt;“This is very exciting for us and for more importantly, for patients, because they have an option now,” said Bain, who runs the Clinic’s Vivistim program and is Fello’s physician. “Once their recovery has plateaued and rehab is no longer working, we have something that we can offer patients to regain that function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IFN3OVPZFVF5FFHCZW3RMI3CYE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stroke symptoms improve with implant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4NLDO6ZY2JGR5DMG4VAJ5BLLBE"&gt;An ischemic stroke, like the one that Fello suffered, happens when a blood clot stops blood from reaching a part of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XHPNVMPRB5A33HGFDENKTRDFU4"&gt;Physicians can take measures to remove blood clots in the brain immediately following a stroke. But after the crisis has passed, the only treatment until recently was physical therapy to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113"&gt;overcome physical disabilities and limb weakness, &lt;/a&gt;Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KOVI3DT2AJC7ZGLWLY7U3LBLK4"&gt;The Vivistim System offers a new way forward. It targets the vagus nerve, a major part of the nervous system controlling heart rate, digestion and other important functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UDEHH46BIRAPLBW7EE7IKHPHQM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/vagus-nerve-stimulation/about/pac-20384565" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/vagus-nerve-stimulation/about/pac-20384565"&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation&lt;/a&gt; uses a device to send electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. Bain said. The device is implanted under the skin in the chest. A wire threaded under the skin connects the device to the left vagus nerve. To change brain activity, the device sends electrical signals along the nerve to the brainstem in the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MZDBPEXWEBGLHHIDKENB675J6A"&gt;A physical therapist uses a wand to activate the stimulation device during rehabilitation therapy sessions. Patients can also turn it on while doing daily tasks at home. The stimulator typically stays on for about four hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKXJGOKOZZDWLGQTA6V2BQTEII"&gt;“When I get home and I want to do stuff, I swipe this magnet over the device, and it triggers it to send impulses (to my arm muscles) every 30 seconds,” Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="427HKBAUHZCTRLXRIGKEA2O7ZM"&gt;In a 2021 clinical study published in the Lancet, about half of the patients who received the implant and physical therapy showed improvement, as compared with only a quarter of patients in the control group. The study was funded by MicroTransponder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GBWA2E4D7BEBHM3YYXHTZSXLPY"&gt;“Almost every patient I operated on had some improvement — some dramatic and some minor, but even minor things have been great,” Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KLV7AE2UIFA7FPBB4QTSV7S25I"&gt;Fello is among about 700 patients across the United States who have received the vagus nerve stimulation implant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N7BUIDA5MVDLBC3MAQ6A5RTYBI"&gt;The Vivistim System program was challenging to launch at the Clinic because it requires input from a surgical team, rehabilitation physicians, occupational therapists and other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FWH3HK6SYVE4JK2QKS4RA6UBJA"&gt;“Before we can implant, we have to make sure that all the rehab is already set up, because there’s a very strict timeline that’s got to be coordinated,” Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="US2GYPE5JBCQLBBIEXRXTLMSGM"&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation must be paired with six to eight weeks of intensive rehabilitation therapy that involves longer and more frequent sessions than conventional therapy, Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5SVZH6L3VDRHIZM5CUBVT7Z2U"&gt;“If you just do one or the other, you don’t get the full benefit of the device,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4CMPGCSQMVH2BCJFPCQ2UJPHQE"&gt;Typically, health insurance only pays for 60-minute sessions for three months of rehabilitation therapy, Bain said. Patients with the implant need 90-minute sessions over six to eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3WNEGTDCIZHL5LLAAR5K4MQVPY"&gt;Immediately after his stroke, Fello was unable to walk and move his left arm. He also had pain when using his right arm to move his paralyzed arm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PWT3SVGQMZG63MT2ARXLBVF4HE"&gt;Now his busy weekly routine includes sessions with occupational and physical therapists as well as stretching and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/on-pins-and-needles-just-what-is-dry-needling" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/on-pins-and-needles-just-what-is-dry-needling"&gt;dry needling, &lt;/a&gt;a therapy that helps relieve muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ORADI4GSZGQ3AUZDZMDYKUR4A"&gt;Like Fello, other stroke patients are learning about the device by word-of-mouth, and contacting the Clinic to find out if they might be candidates for the implant, Bain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P3BHRAFHT5GGFBDYBZJQG6WGQI"&gt;“We had a patient who heard about it on Instagram and gave us a call,” Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PIWXES2QBFKDHIYBTKVHZSATY"&gt;Stroke patients who are candidates for the vagus nerve device must have a certain amount of mobility in their arms. People with too much or too little mobility generally are not good candidates, Bain said. “There’s sort of the sweet spot right in the middle,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CUNTVPYQ5FGXPIFQGAKHNGDGIY"&gt;So far, researchers have only looked into vagus nerve stimulation to treat weakness in the arms, not the legs. Bain thinks the technique could benefit other regions of the body affected by stroke, as well as speech and language issues, but the possibilities have not yet been studied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VZ4I7VONKNFOBAP2OL7JVNKSTY"&gt;Bain and his patients are still learning the limits of what the device can do. Will the increased arm mobility plateau at a certain point? And if so, will it be safe to leave the implant inside the body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4VVWDZL2GJHYTEUMLO7TNGXEPE"&gt;“All these questions need to be answered,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CJ7OBAJ555BCXJYQNGHUBQLPE4"&gt;Bain is encouraged when he sees how much Fello has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZWNICERBOBGZPJW27PN42YJAYY"&gt;Family members and staff have kept Tommy’s Restaurant going in his absence, and Fello stops in a few times a week to say hi to staff and customers. He misses not being there full time, but remains upbeat about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7WVMUNV3QJHTLEBDD4VYFTHZS4"&gt; “I’m hoping I (improve 100%), but you never can tell,” Fello said. “But there are so many other things I can do (at the restaurant).

    &lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again. School is starting, the days are getting shorter and the familiar “flu shots available” signs are appearing outside pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the flu kills tens of thousands of people in the United States, on average, and hundreds of thousands are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you protect yourself this season? Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Should I get a flu vaccine? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, including young, healthy people with no existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need a new vaccine even if you got one last year, both because the antibodies from last year’s shot will have waned by now and because the shots are tailored each year to target different flu strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only exception is if you have a severe allergy to a vaccine ingredient. Even then, your medical provider may be able to identify a different flu vaccine that you can receive safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Are there any changes in eligibility this year? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The Food and Drug Administration determines who is officially eligible for vaccines, and while it has narrowed its approval of COVID shots, it has not done so for flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; When should I get a flu vaccine? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the ideal window is from late September through October. “Try to get vaccinated before Halloween,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. That matches guidance from the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pharmacies start to offer flu vaccines in August or even July. But Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, said you should wait a little longer to get one. That’s because protection from the vaccine decreases after a few months, and flu cases typically peak in December, January or even February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you miss the Halloween mark, it’s still absolutely worth getting vaccinated. “I tell patients that it is generally never too late to get it,” Chin-Hong said. “Some protection is better than none.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Can I get it at the same time as my COVID shot? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. You might have a sorer arm, but it’s safe to get both shots at once. Many public health officials recommend doing so because life can get busy and you might not end up making that second trip to the pharmacy or doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(According to The Washington Post, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/fda-questions-whether-people-should-get-multiple-respiratory-vaccines-together/" class="content-link"&gt;the Food and Drug Administration is scrutinizing the common practice&lt;/a&gt; of giving coronavirus and flu shots together, signaling a reversal of years of federal guidance and a broader crackdown on administering multiple vaccines at the same time.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t forget your RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, shot if you’re in a group for whom that’s recommended: if you’re 75 or older, 50 or older with certain existing health conditions, or 32 to 36 weeks pregnant between September and January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These respiratory diseases, although not the same, tend to spread around the same time, and the groups that are high risk for one tend to be high risk for the others,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and the dean of the Yale School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; How much does the flu shot cost? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have insurance, it should be free. Almost all insurers are required to fully cover shots recommended by the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel, as flu shots are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re uninsured, the cost at a pharmacy can vary depending on the type of vaccine and where you go. Some might charge $20, others more than $100. You may also be able to find a public clinic that offers shots for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; How effective is the vaccine? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This varies from year to year. In telling vaccine manufacturers which flu strains to target, health officials have to make educated guesses about which strains will circulate in the coming season. Efficacy depends on how accurate their predictions are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s preliminary estimates for last flu season found that the vaccines ranged from 41% to 78% effective against hospitalization, and 32% to 60% effective against infections requiring less intensive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you get the flu, being vaccinated can reduce the severity of your symptoms — and that is a major benefit, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each year, millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths are prevented by vaccination,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What are the side effects? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu shots can cause mild and short-lived side effects including soreness at the injection site, fatigue, fever, headache and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious side effects are very rare: One of the best known, Guillain-Barré syndrome, occurs in one or two vaccine recipients in 1 million, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization. The risk of severe illness from a flu infection is many times higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
