			&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt; – the ability to recall past events and experiences – is known to decline as we age. Exactly how and why has remained something of a mystery, and a recent study goes some way towards solving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from the University of Oslo in Norway wanted to see whether this memory loss affects everyone equally, or if it might be driven by individual risk factors, such as the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ε4 gene &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;linked to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of their analysis is impressive. The scientists combined data from 3,737 cognitively healthy participants, tracked over several years, including 10,343  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="189827" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans and 13,460 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;memory assessments&lt;/a&gt;, from multiple long-running studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;We May Now Know Why Alzheimer's Erases Memories of Our Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By integrating data across dozens of research cohorts, we now have the most detailed picture yet of how structural changes in the brain unfold with age and how they relate to memory," &lt;a href="https://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/news/new-mega-analysis-reveals-why-memory-declines-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone, from the Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189830" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1.jpg" alt="Brain scans" class="wp-image-189830 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1-600x281.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189830" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked for links between brain structural changes and memory decline. (Vidal-Piñeiro et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a complex picture. While the hippocampus – a brain region central to memory and learning – was most significant here, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dad2.12110" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as expected&lt;/a&gt;, memory decline was not linked to changes in a single area alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reductions in brain tissue volume were linked to poorer episodic memory, which was not surprising, but the association was far from uniform. It became much clearer with age, especially in those older than 60, and was strongest in participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/male-brains-shrink-faster-than-female-brains-study-finds"&gt;whose brains were shrinking&lt;/a&gt; faster than average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those carrying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; ε4 gene&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers observed a more rapid loss of brain tissue volume and decline in memory compared to other participants, but the general trajectory was the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline and memory loss are not simply the consequence of aging, but manifestations of individual predispositions and age-related processes enabling neurodegenerative processes and diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/news/new-mega-analysis-reveals-why-memory-declines-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alvaro Pascual-Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings raise plenty of questions and offer some answers, but overall they suggest that memory loss isn't necessarily a separate process from aging – and that the older we get, the more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sitting-could-be-shrinking-your-brain-and-exercise-may-not-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain changes&lt;/a&gt; matter for memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also implications for treatments to slow or prevent memory loss: They'll need to target multiple brain areas, and may be most effective if started as early as possible. The good news is that the same therapies are likely to work for those with or without the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ε4 gene, as the underlying mechanisms appear to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-early-signal-of-dementia-hidden-in-terry-pratchetts-novels"&gt;Scientists Found an Early Signal of Dementia Hidden in Terry Pratchett's Novels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's becoming clear that a variety of different factors can influence memory loss in later life, as part of a broader set of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/memory-problems-are-surging-in-adults-under-40-large-us-study-finds"&gt;cognitive capabilities&lt;/a&gt;. The more we learn about those factors, the better our chances of managing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that memory decline in aging is not just about one region or one gene – it reflects a broad biological vulnerability in brain structure that accumulates over decades," &lt;a href="https://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/news/new-mega-analysis-reveals-why-memory-declines-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alvaro Pascual-Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding this can help researchers identify individuals at risk early, and develop more precise and personalized interventions that support cognitive health across the lifespan and prevent cognitive disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66354-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By February, however, those goals are often forgotten.

Recent research fortunately has some welcome advice for the time-stressed in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_27075652.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why is exercise good for you? Scientists are finding answers in our cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing guidelines from most national and global health organizations call for at least 150–300 minutes of moderate physical activity each week, or 75–150 minutes of vigorous activity, for healthy adults, sometimes alongside activities to strengthen muscle and bone. Although those guidelines remain good goals to aim for, newer studies suggest that meaningful health benefits emerge with much less exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are getting a clearer understanding of the bare minimum amount of exercise needed for health gains thanks to data from wearable devices. These can provide more-reliable measurements than do self-reported data, which form much of the basis for current guidelines. By incorporating wearables into study design, researchers can collect accurate data on physical activity minute by minute, says I-Min Lee, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. “And this is when we start to see that even low levels of physical activity are helpful,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data are redefining what counts as physical activity and could push future recommendations towards lower targets. But a potential shift in guidelines needs to be considered carefully in terms of the message it might send, says Emmanuel Stamatakis, a researcher specializing in physical activity and population health at the University of Sydney, Australia. No one wants to suggest that people shouldn’t strive to move more, especially when an estimated 31% of people worldwide don’t meet existing recommendations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and physical inactivity contributes to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03143-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03143-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;health problems such as obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in a bit of an awkward situation because if we are to take the wearable-based evidence at face value, we will have to release guidelines that will be recommending lower amounts” of minimum physical activity, says Stamatakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way in which wearables are changing thinking is by helping to quantify daily inactivity, which might be just as important as how much a person exercises. Some guidelines are already incorporating caps on sedentary time. “Especially if you work from home, you can do very little exercise in a day. It’s quite scary,” says Carol Maher, an exercise researcher at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The more, the better — up to a point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s exercise recommendations are born from large epidemiological studies that compare disease and death rates between those who are more and less physically active. Whereas previous guidelines had focused on enhancing athletic performance and relied mostly on studies in young and fit male medical students, studies beginning in the 1980s followed larger groups of people over many years and included women and older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies have consistently shown that physical activity offers strong protection against cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00720-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00720-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;reduces the risk of several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and lowers the risk of death from any cause, as well as having &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02225-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02225-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mental-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Although observational studies can be limited by potential bias — those who exercise might be healthier to start with — researchers go to great lengths to mitigate this problem. Studies tend to control for variables such as age, smoking status, alcohol consumption and body weight, and adjust for family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03687-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03687-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;postmenopausal hormone use&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sleep duration&lt;/a&gt; and other factors. Some studies exclude participants diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or cancer and those who do not engage in any physical activity. Some also exclude the first years of observation, so that participants with as-yet-undiagnosed diseases can be identified over time. The biases alone cannot explain the findings, says Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51687774.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 meta-analysis found that people who met the recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week — defined as movement that raises heart and breathing rates — had a 14% lower risk of coronary heart disease than those who reported no physical activity in their leisure time&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Such moderate activity, during which the exerciser can still talk but would struggle to sing a song, includes brisk walking and light cycling. Those who exercised even more, about 300 minutes a week, had a 20% lower risk than those who didn’t exercise. Heart benefits continued to increase with more exercise, although gains tapered off at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, even people exercising for half the recommended 150 minutes a week showed heart-disease risk reductions that were almost the same as for those who met the guideline. The authors concluded that “the biggest bang for the buck for coronary-heart-disease risk reduction occurs at the lower end of the activity spectrum: very modest, achievable levels of physical activity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerges for risk of death (see ‘Movement matters’). A 2022 study analysing 30 years of data from 116,221 adults found that those who did 150–300 minutes of moderate physical activity each week had a 20–21% lower risk of all-cause mortality during the study period than those with almost no moderate activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Smaller amounts were already beneficial: 20 to 74 minutes of moderate activity a week resulted in a 9% lower risk of death. People who exercised up to about 600 minutes a week — four times the recommended minimum — had an extra 10–11% reduction in risk. But going beyond that didn’t provide further benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51974440.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51974440.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="MOVEMENT MATTERS.

Those participants spent, on average, 2.2 minutes a day in this type of activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A big part of the benefit comes from going from doing nothing to doing something,” says Leandro Rezende, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil, and a co-author of the 2022 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vigorous physical activity — the type of movement that makes speaking difficult, such as cycling uphill or running — as little as 15 minutes each week can be enough to reduce the risk of death. A prospective study, reported in 2022, that followed participants for almost six years revealed that this modest effort resulted in an 18% lower mortality risk over the study period&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The analysis adjusted for how much light and moderate physical activity the participants did overall, as well as other underlying health conditions that could affect their capacity to do vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies using different measures of physical activity come to similar conclusions about &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the benefits of minimal exercise&lt;/a&gt;. A 2019 analysis — which adjusted for factors such as self-rated health and family history of diseases — concluded that, among older women, taking 4,400 steps a day (far below the 10,000 steps that many people aim for) is already associated with a lower mortality risk&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Benefits levelled after 7,500 steps a day. Although there isn’t an exact correspondence between number of steps and minutes of activity, another study using accelerometer data from around 3,500 people found that those who reached 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in a week typically accumulated around 7,000 steps a day (including from intentional exercise and everyday activities)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of wearables opened the door to studying exercise sessions that are shorter than 10 minutes, as well as lighter physical activity. Stamatakis is among those who began investigating the effect of short bursts of vigorous activity in people’s daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that he has loved movement since his childhood in Greece, when he spent hours playing football after school. The idea of studying how people can enhance their health with everyday movement occurred to him around 2008. Living in Brighton, UK, he grew sick of the local traffic. “I sold my car, and I started walking everywhere and cycling everywhere,” Stamatakis recalls. “It felt so liberating. It felt so nice. I felt more connected with my community. From that point on, I started converting this into a scientific interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03632-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51939902.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How much protein do you really need?

"What if, instead, during the premonitory phase of an attack, you're sensitive to scent, you notice smells that you wouldn't normally." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Goadsby has analysed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ene.12451" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;the brain scans of migraine patients&lt;/a&gt; who feel that light triggers their attack and compared them to patients who don't tend to blame light for the onset of their pain. Only the former had overactivity in the part of the brain responsible for vision right before their migraine, suggesting that, during that moment, they were biologically primed to be more sensitive to light than their counterparts. "Unquestionably, something is going on biologically," says Goadsby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the quest to discover what that underlying biological mechanism has been a long one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="the-genetic-origin-of-migraine" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="the-genetic-origin-of-migraine" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;The genetic origin of migraine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/head.14789" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Studies on twins&lt;/a&gt; show that there is a strong genetic component and that if your &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0333102419828989" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;parents or grandparents had migraine&lt;/a&gt;, you're statistically likely to inherit the neurological condition too. Inherited genes appear to play a role in an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442224000267" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;estimated 30-60%&lt;/a&gt; of people who suffer from migraine, with other cumulative external factors such as life history, environment and behaviour accounting for the rest, says Dale Nyholt, a geneticist at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nyholt is screening thousands of people to find the exact genes running amok, but the quest has been "more complex than what we were ideally hoping for", he says.

Morning people did slightly better than the intermediate group, with a 5% lower risk of having a poor LE8 score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers found the evening people had a 16% higher risk of both heart attack and stroke. Researchers estimated that about 75% of this higher risk was explained by other LE8 factors, rather than sleep timing alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It isn't being a night owl that's a problem," Knutson said. "I think being a night owl who's trying to live in a morning lark's world is a conflict between one's internal clock and their social clock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The higher risk appeared to be due to certain lifestyle behaviors and other health factors, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nicotine use had the strongest impact on heart health, explaining 34% of the link between late bedtime and heart disease. Shorter sleep duration accounted for 14% of the extra risk, high blood sugar for 12% and body weight and diet each accounted for about 11% of the increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Behavioral effects of being a night owl were stronger in women than in men -- women were 96% more likely to have lower LE8 scores compared to 67% in men, though they did not have a higher risk of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Women are further stressed by that lifestyle because they're having to still get up and be the primary caregiver for family members," Dr. Sonia Tolani, preventative cardiologist, Associate Professor of Medicine, and co-director of the Columbia University Women's Heart Center, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded prevention efforts should focus on improving lifestyle habits when spending more time awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The most obvious way is to quit smoking and that's not new advice," Knutson says. "But sleep regularity, meaning trying to go to bed at about the same time every day and not jumping around the clock -- particularly on days off -- can really help lead to regular timing of other behaviors like light exposure, meals, exercise activity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Prioritize the low-hanging fruit" recommended Tolani. If an hour at the gym is not doable, "maybe you can find a way to do a 10-minute walk or cut a little bit of salt from your diet.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian authorities said they had contained a Nipah virus outbreak after confirming two cases in the eastern state of West Bengal, as several Asian countries tightened health screenings and airport surveillance for travelers arriving from India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s Health Ministry said Tuesday that two Nipah cases had been detected since December and that all identified contacts had been quarantined and tested. The ministry did not release details about the patients but said 196 contacts had been traced and all tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place,” the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nipah, a zoonotic virus first identified during a 1990s outbreak in Malaysia, spreads through fruit bats, pigs and human-to-human contact. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can cause raging fevers, convulsions and vomiting. The only treatment is supportive care to control complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The virus has an estimated fatality rate of between 40% and 75%, according to the WHO, making it far more deadly than the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were no reported cases of the virus outside India, but several Asian countries introduced or reinforced screening measures at airports as a precaution. The safety measures were put in place after early media reports from India suggested a surge in cases, but health authorities said those figures were “speculative and incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia and Thailand increased screening at major airports, with health declarations, temperature checks and visual monitoring for arriving passengers. Thailand’s Department of Disease Control said thermal scanners had been installed at arrival gates for direct flights from West Bengal at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s Health Ministry advised against nonessential travel to West Bengal and urged travelers to seek immediate medical care if symptoms develop within 14 days of travel. It said fever surveillance introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic at airports has been intensified for passengers arriving from India, with laboratory testing capacity and medical supplies readied.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s Health Ministry on Tuesday urged strict food safety practices and directed local authorities to increase monitoring at border crossings, health facilities and communities, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China said it was strengthening disease prevention measures in border areas. State media reported that health authorities had begun risk assessments and enhanced training for medical staff, while increasing monitoring and testing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Nipah outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007, while recent cases have largely been detected in southern Kerala state. A major outbreak in 2018 killed at least 17 people in Kerala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press journalists across Asia contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

Many women and girls report a sense of inner restlessness, and a racing mind full of thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because their difficulties can be less immediately visible at both home and in the classroom, girls are often under-diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their behaviours may not be ‘disruptive’. They may also work hard to mask them, which can lead to perfectionism.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vbmg002y26p55jxz75vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How a person will be diagnosed with mental illness could look significantly different in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8eq0s00013b6prpxmov5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Psychiatric Association announced Wednesday that it is radically reconceptualizing the main manual that clinicians use to make a mental health diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders will get a new name, new voices shaping its content and a new approach that will add more layers to a diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8qpkf00033b6pzob84lr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hope is that it will turn what some call “psychiatry’s bible” into more of a guidebook to mental health disorders — one that’s more inclusive, dynamic and educational, so patients will receive more effective treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0006336pu2s8rkea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A mental health disorder impacts an individual’s thoughts and behavior and can cause ongoing distress or impair their ability to function. Why someone has a particular mental health disorder can vary, stemming from a complicated mix of brain chemistry, genetics, life experience and a person’s environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0007336pnlt1egiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike with an infection, where doctors can use an objective blood test to pinpoint the bacteria or virus causing the problem, there are few simple tests to determine what kind of mental health disorder someone has.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8zkhg00053b6pl11id3dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, psychiatrists created the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-the-dsm" target="_blank"&gt; commonly known as the DSM&lt;/a&gt;, to categorize mental health disorders, create diagnostic criteria and provide descriptive text to help professionals make an appropriate diagnosis based on their observations of a patient’s symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8dtvx00003b6p9ag5d6vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of all people will experience a psychiatric disorder in their lifetime, research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9puw7000e3b6p1sj7bum7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Putting a label on a mental health disorder is essential so that clinicians know how to treat a patient. The DSM is also important for practical reasons, like billing and insurance purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0008336pvmbl9kxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Used by more than just psychiatrists, the DSM is considered the very foundation of how mental health issues are understood. The DSM gives patients, researchers, insurance, lawyers and others a common language to identify particular mental health issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0009336przm4i2xq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current edition, DSM-5-TR, contains more than 300 distinct mental disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and alcohol use disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While APA updates the manual regularly to reflect the most up-to-date science, the last update was 2022. Over the years, the DSM has come under heavy criticism. Some argue it’s not scientific enough, others argue it’s not specific enough, or even practical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx93zjh00093b6pn017t07v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, to improve the manual, the APA turned to an unlikely source for inspiration: its critics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000a336pohkcy4iv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The critics are loud, so it’s very hard to ignore them,” joked Dr. Maria Oquendo, chair of APA’s Future DSM Strategic Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx96f7l000b3b6p2b3egz33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oquendo said the APA spoke with several to get a better sense of how the DSM could be improved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000b336p7im0nbt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t have ownership of all the best ideas, and if they’re out there, we want to hear them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000g336p4c2crymj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first things APA said it will change is the manual’s name. Going forward, DSM will stand for Diagnostic Science Manual of Mental Disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9t9zl000p3b6pqezsy9m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the APA first created the DSM in the 1950s, many people were institutionalized, Oquendo said. Public policy makers who funded mental institutions wanted to keep track of the number of people with particular disorders, but in an era of deinstitutionalization, numbers aren’t as important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000h336pca3zpime@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To create the DSM, the APA pulls together hundreds of experts from around the world who discuss definitions and treatments. There are also field trials and tests. One of the bigger changes going forward is that the APA will invite people with a lived experience of a particular diagnosis to sit on the APA’s committees and shape diagnostic descriptions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000i336pdhsgt18v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another change is to take more of a person’s life into consideration when a clinician gives a diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9z8hj000r3b6peqqz4l9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The traditional focus of the DSM has been on observable characteristics and symptoms — in other words, “the way things appear, rather than on their underlying mechanisms,” said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the vice chair of the Future DSM Strategic Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000j336pe791nn40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Psychiatric disorders, as we’ve come to understand them, reflect a complex interplay of really, all features of the human condition, environmental, socioeconomic, cultural, developmental as well as biological factors,” said Alpert, who also chairs the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000k336pargsaknl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new approach will not necessarily replace a particular diagnosis, like opioid use disorder. Rather, it would add another layer to the diagnosis that will take into account more contextual experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9sfv8000m3b6pxwex0533@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, if someone’s been mistreated as a child, that can have a profound impact on their psychiatric illness, said Dr. Diana Clark, who is the APA’s senior director of research. Factors that impact mental disorders “don’t occur in a vacuum,” Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxardy600143b6pnlou0qtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person’s background and experience have always been a part of diagnosing a mental illness, but foregrounding it will “help the clinician look at the person as a whole and not just at the symptoms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000m336pu3vdphey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How to make the proposed changes practical is something the APA is still trying to figure out, Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000n336pd73ejyxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know we need to be brief so the clinician can use it, but in also doing anything that’s brief, we know that can also lead to some kind of oversimplification,” Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000o336ps009p5bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Biological factors are also something the APA wants to incorporate better into the DSM. While there is no genetic test for obsessive compulsive  disorder yet, the hope is to make the DSM flexible enough to incorporate technology that may not exist yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000p336pusd7ocjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve reached a stage in psychiatry where the question is really no longer whether biomarkers belong in the DSM, but really how to introduce them in a way that is something transparent, ethically and clinically useful,” Alpert said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000q336p26fa9nj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The APA also wants to make it so that a diagnosis has more flexibility, said Oquendo, who also chairs the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxasz4100163b6p5n3ggx6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, a patient may turn up in the ER with a mental health problem, but if a doctor only has 15 minutes to assess the problem, a doctor may feel compelled to pick a diagnosis, even if it isn’t completely clear. The APA hopes to create diagnostic categories that can lead to less specific labels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000s336prp7rf46b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no timeline to make these major changes to the DSM. Changes often can take years, but the APA said it’s already having conversations with insurance companies about this shift.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000t336pwk6m4vbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Categorizing mental health disorders is not easy, said Dr. Daniel Morehead, a psychiatrist who is not working on the DSM project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000u336pfb5e9o9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The most complex physical object in the universe that we know is the human brain, and so we’re not going to put it into a few neat little categories,” said Morehead, who is a program director of the Adult&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Psychiatry Residency Program at Tufts Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000v336p7c1put77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Morehead hopes the APA will make the DSM a much more dynamic document that takes more of the whole person into account, not just their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxb22lj00183b6p1snq5wqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very hard to do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000w336p4i48fu92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oquendo said she believes the APA is up to the task.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000x336pu6ujte7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we will not only be pragmatic, but also scientifically rigorous and forward thinking,” she said. “We have to do it right so it might take a little bit of time, but we’ll try and do it as fast as possible because the field is ready for it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The diagnostic manual known as "the Bible of psychiatry" is about to get a major overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychiatric Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA) puts out the tome known in the field as the DSM-5. That stands for the &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/dsm" target="_blank"&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The APA outlined its thinking and approach for the next revision in five studies published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/journal/ajp" target="_blank"&gt;The American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of a weighty volume, the next DSM will be "a living document" online and easier to update. The APA hasn't set a strict timeline and hasn't decided yet if it will be called the DSM-6 or some new name. But it is seeking input from a broad range of both mental health professionals and people who have psychiatric conditions. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The DSM is really the foundational framework for mental health diagnosis," said &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g332/p8936060" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maria Oquendo&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Strategic Committee in charge of the future of the manual, speaking at a press conference announcing the research supporting the new approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The DSM is used by psychiatrists, psychologists, physicians, researchers, and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very useful in the sense that it helps you think about what is going on with the patient in a hopefully accurate way," says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205956968/jennifer-havens" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Havens&lt;/a&gt;, chair of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. "Because the essential thing you have to do in any illness is diagnose it. And if you make the right diagnosis, you prescribe or initiate the right treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Keeping it current &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past, the DSM has been revised every 15 years or so, with the DSM-5 published in 2013. "Each revision reflects advances in science, clinical practice and sociocultural understanding," said Oquendo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that lengthy process and making it available in a print format has had limitations, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-gogtay-m-d-4889ab45/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nitin Gogtay&lt;/a&gt;, deputy medical director of the APA, who also spoke at the virtual press conference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Clinicians and other stakeholders may lack uniform and timely access to the most current evidence that might delay translation of new discoveries into the practice," he said. "We want this process to be as current as possible."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Keeping the next edition primarily online means it can be updated more regularly to reflect recent scientific developments in diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing critiques of the DSM &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of the other changes to the manual are intended to incorporate scientific advancements in understanding of mental disorders, their diagnoses and treatment, and address common criticisms of the current DSM.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many critiques out there," said Oquendo. "And perhaps the most salient one is the fact that the DSM doesn't reference what the causes of mental disorders are."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a fairly standard approach in medicine to try to understand the causes of an illness," says Havens, who isn't involved in revising the manual. "If you understand the causes of the illness, maybe you can prevent it. It absolutely affects your treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the underlying causes of mental illnesses are complex — involving an interplay of genetics, biology, one's environment and life experiences — and there were conflicting ideas about causes in past decades, past DSMs left them out. (The DSM-5 acknowledged potential causes under "Risk and Prognostic Factors.". )&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not accounting for causes can harm diagnoses and treatment plans, says Havens. Take for example, the lasting impact of childhood traumas on people's mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Trauma causes a significant amount of the mental illness that we see in everybody," she says. "And it increases the vulnerability of people who are going to have serious, persistent mental illness like schizophrenia tremendously. And it's part of the problem in the field that we don't understand that enough as a cause and we don't intervene enough. "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, researchers know a lot more about the factors that cause or exacerbate mental illnesses. And that will be factored into future DSMs and approaches to prevention of mental health symptoms in different populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oquendo says things like living in poverty, or near environmental toxins, or being part of a religious or cultural minority who faces additional daily stressors can all affect mental health negatively.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, future DSMs will emphasize factors that influence mental health symptoms and outline approaches to prevention of symptoms in different populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This would be a "sea change in psychiatry," says Havens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The role of biological markers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the publication of DSM-5 there have been significant advances in understanding the biological roots of mental health disorders. Those advancements have brought scientists closer to discovering biological markers for various disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They might be blood tests; they might be neuro imaging tests. They might even be digital tests from wearable devices or cognitive testing that are meant to measure biological processes that might underlie mental disorders," says Dr. Jonathan Alpert, vice chair of the Future DSM Steering Committee of the APA and head of psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One area where the Food and Drug Administration has already approved tests for biomarkers is for Alzheimer's disease, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are blood tests and tests of cerebrospinal fluid that look at some of the proteins," Alpert says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another kind of biological marker in the near future may be certain markers of inflammation for people with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A subset of people with major depressive disorder, also called clinical depression, have elevated measures of inflammation, and that can be picked up even by a blood test of C-reactive protein (CRP)," says Alpert. CRP is a marker for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Those people seem to respond preferentially well to anti-inflammatory agents either by themselves or in addition to more standard antidepressants like SSRIs," like Prozac and Lexapro.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Discussions of who can benefit from such testing within the population of people with major depression may be in a future version of the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Lived experience voices &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, the APA is putting its thinking and overall strategy out into the world for feedback from the public, including health care providers, advocates and people living with mental illnesses. They want this next version to be informed by a wider circle of people than just psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's a strong recognition that there were not enough voices included in our prior iterations of this document," says Dr. Tami Benton, who leads child and adolescent psychiatry at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and is a member of the DSM strategic committee. "There's going to have to be greater inclusion of individuals who are affected — people with lived experience, including adolescents and their families and children and their families."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNTHJkRTFJNnFzalJtLWVhNkp3dThITkRIdkVkTmh0Z2xUZXdsVV92Tkk2ZFJMNnhua21yemRVa014cnNSa0lLeEd1Y0lPdnprZHljaTVtYmVhM0NZU0psODNCWHdsU0Nyd3l5S3NJLW1lRkpGdGw4RXJ5ek1hR2FIVlhJck02MEcxNjlLbUdZQmVnbmpxTHlDWDVXZ1g5THgtMG94MGVEdFZOR3F4</guid></item><item><title>骨科医生敦促每个人每天做一次伸展运动，以消除长时间坐着造成的损伤-只需三分钟- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/an-osteopath-urges-everyone-to-do-this-one-daily-stretch-to-undo-the-damage-caused-by-prolonged-sitting-it-only-takes-three-minutes</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;p id="86c843eb-7add-4867-a529-c063019efcf0"&gt;There is no single remedy that will reverse the damage done by prolonged sitting, says associate osteopath Andy McIntyre BOst MSc from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;The Livewell Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there are two areas that, for me, take the biggest brunt from sedentary postures,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="86c843eb-7add-4867-a529-c063019efcf0-2"&gt;The first one is the hips, which he says can be addressed by practicing gentle hinging movements like good mornings and deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other pain point tends to be the "mid thoracic" area. This refers to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Thoracic_Anatomy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Thoracic_Anatomy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;middle section of the spine&lt;/a&gt;, around the T1 to T12 of the vertebrae between the neck (cervical spine) and lower back (lumbar spine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all hunch forward when sat at a desk,” McIntyre explains. “We get kyphotic. Our shoulders drop forward. Our mid and upper back rounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compensate, these vertebrae can stiffen, which further restricts the range of motion for everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are very clever. To adapt to this [hunched position] joints stiffen up in our mid-back so we require less energy to hold ourselves there all the time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we then come to use our shoulders, when we come to run, when we do anything else, that stiffness is still there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the shoulders and other parts of the spine, like the neck, have to compensate and work harder to do basic things, like look over our shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like how we decondition our hips by being at a desk, we are deconditioning our thoracic spine all the time when sat forward in this hunched position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-mobilize-the-thoracic-spine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-mobilize-the-thoracic-spine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to mobilize the thoracic spine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="82c8a20a-f006-4ec7-aa45-4073844ae098"&gt;To arrest and reverse this deconditioning, McIntyre says we should all be working on thoracic extension and rotation in order to “undo the damage from being chained to a desk all the time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the best ways of unlocking extension is through thoracic rotation,” he says. “If our spine can rotate, then it will be able to do all the other planes of motion much more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For McIntyre, that means practicing an exercise called open the book first thing in the morning and last thing at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If extra time allows, he also performs the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back"&gt;thread the needle&lt;/a&gt; exercise, which similarly targets the thoracic spine—though he favors the open the book exercise if he had to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best moves for thoracics are anything that involves rotation either flat to a mat or flat to a wall,” says McIntyre, because it will “force us to bias our thoracic spine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do those [two exercises] pretty much every day and though I’m not at a desk as much as some people can be, even I notice the stiffness quite significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-the-open-the-book-stretch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-open-the-book-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the open the book stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="OW6YHlxY6JI"&gt;

You want the pelvis and knees to be fixed to the floor, so all the movement comes from the thoracic spine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIntyre says it helps to follow your hands with your gaze. “Look over your shoulder to follow that arm. That helps encourage rotation through your entire thoracic spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, McIntyre does three sets of one minute on each side, but if you’re just starting out you can begin with just 30 seconds each side, so three minutes in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW-JJePntKrh7flboQy1O5UMnp2mDwPN436" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW-JJePntKrh7flboQy1O5UMnp2mDwPN436 slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Andy McIntyre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy McIntyre B.Ost (Bachelors of Osteopathy) is an osteopath registered with the General Osteopathic Council, who works at &lt;a href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;The Livewell Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in Clapham Junction, London. Having originally worked as a software developer, he changed his career towards sports massage and osteopathy, training at the London School of Osteopathy, and has since explored further training in 3D movement analysis and postural assessment to better assist his clients. He works with the generally desk-bound public as well as more highly-trained athletes to help get them out of pain and into better movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Understanding these microscopic messengers could change the fight against metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing cancer from spreading throughout the body is the goal of our team at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Prof. Julia Burnier and biology specialists at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, we are working to understand how cancers transform into metastases; in other words, how they invade other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-warning-sign-discovered-in-the-gut-may-increase-cancer-risk"&gt;A Hidden Warning Sign Discovered in The Gut May Increase Cancer Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about eight years, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-91873-5"&gt;my team has been studying&lt;/a&gt; lipid nanoparticles, which are barely 100 nanometers in size and invisible to the naked eye. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads5249"&gt;Our first task is to understand&lt;/a&gt; the path of metastasis. Then we try to determine different ways to inject drugs into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles, such as liposomes, differ from conventional approaches to cancer treatment because they deliver drugs directly to tumour cells. That increases their effectiveness and reduces toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38543294/"&gt;Researchers have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that liposomes target tumours more effectively and reduce side effects, while &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8069739/"&gt;others have observed&lt;/a&gt; that these nanomedicines improve the penetration and specificity of treatment, particularly in the case of metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that nanomedicines can make cancer treatments more targeted, more effective, and improve their tolerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_190383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190383" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-642x361.jpg" alt="Illustration of a blue and purple sphere, showing intricately detailed structures inside it" class="wp-image-190383 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-190383" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lipid nanoparticles deliver drugs directly to tumour cells. (Tumeggy/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tiny particles responsible for spreading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every cell in our body, whether healthy or cancerous, releases tiny particles called extracellular vesicles. These small bubbles, made of lipids and proteins, also carry genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a cancer cell releases its vesicles into the bloodstream and they are transferred to a healthy cell, they can alter its DNA and turn it into a cancer cell. This is how cancer spreads to other organs, such as the liver. This mechanism is the basis of metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, extracting and studying these natural vesicles is a long and difficult process. To speed up our research, my team produces artificial copies called liposomes using small devices called micromixers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mixing different solutions – lipids, proteins, water, and ethanol – our research team creates particles that resemble natural vesicles. The challenge is then to understand which lipids and proteins are contained in extracellular vesicles in order to produce liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then inject these liposomes into liver cancer cells to see how they react. The more the cells retain these particles, the more it proves that the copies mimic reality well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical experiment, liposomes are manufactured with precise parameters to reproduce the size and charge of extracellular vesicles. They are also made visible by staining them with a fluorescent marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These liposomes are then incubated with cancer cells grown in our laboratory. This makes it possible to film and measure, in real time and without disturbing the cells, how and at what speed the liposomes are absorbed and expressed by the cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the more the liposomes resemble natural vesicles in size and charge, the more effectively they are absorbed. This allows us to see how their chemical and physical composition influences how they are absorbed by cells and their possible role in tumour development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Observing the behaviour of liposomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to understand how these extracellular vesicles are transported to liver cells to create metastases. The main challenge is to ensure that these liposomes can truly mimic extracellular vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently achieving a 50 per cent efficiency rate for protein encapsulation. We aim to increase this to 90 per cent. We hope this will enable us to explain how metastases form so that we can block them. Once the technique has been refined, our team will conduct tests on rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, this work could be a game-changer for many patients by preventing the formation of metastases and increasing their chances of survival. Our goal: to understand and block metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Towards new treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team seeks not only to understand the process, but to develop new weapons against cancer. The idea is to use these liposomes as tiny shuttles that can transport drugs directly to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diameters of the liposomes differ depending on the cancerous organ to be treated. Therefore, it's very important to properly characterize and understand the properties of these liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers are currently testing the encapsulation of turmeric, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1399888"&gt;which has been studied for its anti-cancer properties&lt;/a&gt;. Our team is doing the same to observe how cancer cells react to these liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that turmeric, and more specifically the curcumin it contains, helps fight cancer by slowing the growth of tumour cells and promoting their destruction by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572272/"&gt;Many studies&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which can enhance the action of cancer treatments. By encapsulating turmeric in liposomes, we are improving its ability to reach and target diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the secret of cancer spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this molecule, other molecules such as paclitaxel are already used in cancer treatments in liposomal form. Encapsulated paclitaxel improves drug delivery and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also innovative strategies that use liposomes to transport small pieces of DNA or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="190368" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that act as messengers, which help the body to better detect and fight diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These approaches have been validated in &lt;a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047585/"&gt;several scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; and are already being used in certain cancer treatments, with new advances being made every year to improve their effectiveness and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-3d-print-material-deep-inside-the-body-using-ultrasound"&gt;Scientists '3D Print' Material Deep Inside The Body Using Ultrasound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using liposomes to replicate the body's natural vesicles emanating from cancer cells, our team hopes to unlock the secret of how cancer spreads and determine effective approaches to block it. Our research paves the way for more targeted treatments that can prevent metastasis and improve patient survival rates.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271593/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

When the gene producing OTULIN was removed completely, tau disappeared – it was no longer being produced at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, this tau removal didn't seem to affect the health of the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;Switching Off One Crucial Protein Appears to Reverse Brain Aging in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons from a donor with Alzheimer's were compared with neurons grown from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="189623" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; taken from healthy donors, which showed that both OTULIN and tau were more abundant in the neurons affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pathological tau is the main player for both brain aging and neurodegenerative disease," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-researchers-discover-new-master-regulator-of-tau-a-protein-implicated-in-many-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular geneticist Karthikeyan Tangavelou, from the University of New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you stop tau synthesis by targeting OTULIN in neurons, you can restore a healthy brain and prevent brain aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189626" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures.jpg" alt="OTULIN features" class="wp-image-189626 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers discovered new roles for OTULIN in RNA metabolism and gene expression.

Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of disrupting or removing OTULIN as a treatment to slow brain aging is unfeasible, at least for the foreseeable future. Both the enzyme and tau play key roles in our body's functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers point out, any kind of OTULIN restriction would need to be carefully managed in order to avoid causing damage elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered OTULIN's function in neurons," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-researchers-discover-new-master-regulator-of-tau-a-protein-implicated-in-many-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tangavelou. "We don't know how OTULIN functions in other cell types in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, these are interesting and rather surprising findings that could prove incredibly useful in future research. One of our best chances at treating Alzheimer's seems to be in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-natural-molecule-may-help-clear-buildup-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;removing the harmful protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it.

Not only was tau production stopped, but the activity of dozens of other genes was impacted, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genes were mostly associated with inflammation, the researchers found, suggesting that OTULIN can play a key role in neuron stress, and wear and tear on the brain when it's not operating as it normally should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this all has to be tested in animal and human models, but scientists now potentially have another target to aim at when developing treatments for Alzheimer's and other related diseases.

Are you heterosexual? It can even be as extreme as worrying are you a paedophile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt; "A really common one is intrusive thoughts about contamination and worries about getting ill or spreading sickness," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;OCD most commonly begins in puberty or early adolescence, but some people are diagnosed later in life as they can "go years masking or covering up the distress," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Research suggests there may be a genetic component to developing OCD as well as links to early life stress such as bullying, bereavement or family breakdown, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Chartered psychologist Kimberley Wilson says almost everyone experiences intrusive thoughts at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Research suggests around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211364914000128" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;80% of us have these thoughts&lt;/a&gt;," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For most people, those thoughts pass quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We can look at them, think they're weird, and put them aside," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you're unable to dismiss the thoughts, that's when you may need to seek help, she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"OCD-related thoughts don't pass on, they take up residence and they're never positive thoughts - they're aggressive, hostile and not easy to deal with. That's when it becomes all-consuming and leads to compulsions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Signs of compulsions can be mental, like counting to a certain number, or visible, such as repeatedly checking car tyres even when you know they're fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How to manage OCD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In these cases "a professional or specialist can work out what's best for you," says Nina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Alongside professional help, Nina says there are techniques people can use day-to-day to reduce distress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One is learning to label thoughts. "Recognising 'I'm having an intrusive thought' creates distance and remind me that it's not me," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some people also find it helpful to visualise OCD as something separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Drawing what OCD looks like can help - there's me and there's OCD, and those are two different things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Self-care also matters. "Eating well, resting and physical activity can help as my  OCD is always worse when I'm stressed and not looking after myself," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Today, Nina still lives with OCD but has learned how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've never got over OCD, but I can function with it. I now have mild intrusive thoughts and a lot of insight into how I manage it.

&lt;h2&gt;“Damning”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

As birds concentrate, so does the avian influenza virus, increasing the risk of environmental contamination and spillover into domestic poultry, wild predatory species, and even our beloved outdoor domestic cats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WSDA advises pet owners to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure, such as keeping pets indoors or in covered areas and avoiding contact with wild birds. The department also recommends practicing good hygiene and avoiding feeding pets raw milk or uncooked meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/washington-state-department-of-agriculture-wsda-indoor-cats-contaminated-raw-food-wild-coast-veterinary-treatment-animal-disease-diagnostic-laboratory" target="_blank"&gt;WSDA warns pet owners after avian flu found in cats linked to contaminated raw food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is primarily found in birds but can infect other animals, including cats, foxes, skunks, and raccoons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms in pets include decreased energy, respiratory issues, and neurological signs. Pet owners are urged to contact a veterinarian if they notice signs of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the avian influenza outbreak began in 2022, 149 domestic cats in the United States have tested positive for bird flu, with four cases in Washington linked to raw pet food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>komonews.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgJBVV95cUxOU3lvZ0I2Z3c1NmQyamJFSXNXaFJ6RXZkM2VzU0dLYU93OGgwSWp0MjNoTkwzdmtieTlJUmxfNlY0YTFtTlhpVS1jTTFCcW1RYTNIeXBOblV6ckE3VTVkX1g1NFRjZU1CQWRIdGNWcXVYbWhMcVM5YUtWVzFldzB1XzRKUUhpQ1V0cVZHY09SMmhMOFl4RW9Pb1RhWUc2WWVFa2xPblVHLUtFbUdVMDh3emNfbkdiamVCaUZWSXBzbEUxUlZWcnlycVJ0WG1hSkJ0UzJlMWRvMENVME5hY3ZZSlpveml4TXdwelBMazR0ZFQ0QU1aTkxUT0phNGhmSThFbW5aUGZoNThZQzk2OU5qUkpUT1BUUk1udzJTSG8wNktyQXV6TXl6Z2MxQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>肠道炎症与阿尔茨海默病的关联再次得到证实- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-link-to-alzheimers-disease-confirmed-once-again</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

What's more, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.972982/full"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found increased gut inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heston and colleagues suspect microbiome changes trigger gut changes that lead to system-wide inflammation. This inflammation is mild but chronic, causing subtle, incremental damage that eventually interferes with the sensitivity of our body's barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increased gut permeability could result in higher blood levels of inflammatory molecules and toxins derived from gut lumen, leading to systemic inflammation, which in turn may impair the blood-brain barrier and may promote neuroinflammation, and potentially neural injury and neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://www.adrc.wisc.edu/news/gut-inflammation-associated-aging-and-alzheimers-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of Wisconsin bacteriologist Federico Rey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now testing mice to see if diet changes associated with increased inflammation can trigger the rodent version of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research there's still no effective treatment for the millions of people with Alzheimer's worldwide. But with a greater understanding of the biological processes, scientists are getting closer, piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45929-z"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They can include dabs of blood on toilet paper after a bowel movement and lingering abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Garza, who noticed specks of blood and intense pressure with bowel movements in the spring of 2014. Over the next few weeks, Garza, who was 45 at the time, became bloated and was in so much abdominal pain that he was limited to a 'practically all liquid diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, and contrary to what you might expect for cancer patients, he actually packed on weight, going from about 150lbs to 170lbs in a matter of months, despite exercising regularly and hardly eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one year later, Garza underwent surgery for a hernia. At a follow-up appointment after the surgery, doctors felt a mass in his anal sphincter, a group of muscles that help release stool from the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Daniel Garza (pictured) was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2015. Doctors believe HIV had increased his risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On May 5, 2015, a colonoscopy and biopsy revealed stage two anal squamous cell carcinoma, which makes up nine in 10 anal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For early stages such as this, where the anal cancer has not spread, the five-year survival rate is 85 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. If it spreads, however, that rate drops to 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite spending 15 years advocating for HIV awareness and risk factors, Garza was blindsided, never envisioning the disease could cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show HIV can raise the risk of several forms of cancer, including anal cancer, because of its effects on the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV has also been shown to increase the risk of contracting human papillomavirus (HPV), another sexually transmitted infection that causes more than nine in 10 cases of anal cancer. Garza believes he acquired HPV at some point in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also estimates that men who have sex with men, such as Garza, are up to 20 times more likely to be diagnosed with anal cancer, as HPV can be transmitted to the anus through anal sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After all these years of doing education and prevention and advocacy, I had never heard of the cancers that were associated with HIV,' Garza, now 55, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know that. I've never heard it talked about. It was never brought up. As gay and Latino men, we don't talk about any cancers below the belt, and it just never came up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, anal cancer affects about 11,000 Americans, roughly 70 percent of whom are women due to a higher likelihood of contracting HPV. Anal cancer kills just under 2,200 people, with an even split between men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall risk of being diagnosed with the disease is about one in 500, according to the American Cancer Society, and it accounts for just 0.5 percent of all new cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 30 percent of anal cancer patients are between 55 and 64 years old, and the average age at diagnosis is 64. However, HIV is most often diagnosed in people between the ages of 25 and 34, which could be contributing to anal cancer in people under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza during his cancer treatments. He is now cancer-free, but the disease caused him to lose half of his anal sphincter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the American Cancer Society shows the gradual increase in anal cancer cases from 1975 through 2023, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer in the US saw an average yearly increase of three percent from 2001 to 2015. Federal data suggests there was a 46 percent surge between 2005 and 2018, largely among older people who did not get the opportunity to be vaccinated for HPV when they were younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006 and was only recommended for girls and women between the ages of nine and 26. It was approved for boys in 2009. The recommended age range meant that much of the still-vulnerable, older population missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV can also lay dormant for decades, which may be fueling an increase of anal cancer in people in their 50s and 60s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis, Garza immediately went into advocate mode and began documenting parts of his cancer journey. He made a series of YouTube videos for the first 30 days after his diagnosis, which went up until he shaved his head before receiving chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That side of me was like, "Yes, let's do this. Let's talk about this,"' he told the Daily Mail. 'If I didn't know how to start the conversation, there was going to be millions of people out there that don't know how to either, we need to learn together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the other part of me, as a Latino gay man, did feel some shame.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Fawcett died of anal cancer at age 62, it sparked an overwhelming amount of speculation from fans and tabloids about her sex life. Anal cancer was long seen as taboo and inherently tied to sexuality and sex habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza (right) with his partner, Christian (left). Garza told the Daily Mail that he struggled with feelings of shame after being diagnosed with anal cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from a 2022 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows an increase in anal cancer in men and women above the age of 50 in 2014 - 2018 compared to 2001 - 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza also told the Daily Mail that he worried damage to his anus from cancer and treatments could impact intimacy with his longtime partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a lot of trauma,' he said. 'It's part of our identity, so I developed some shame and some stigma. There was a time where I was like, "Is this my fault? Is this the punishment for my sexuality?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza started treatment in late May 2015, which included 38 rounds of radiation, weekly chemotherapy and 40 rounds of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HBOT involves lying flat in a chamber with up to three times more air pressure than normal. The goal is to breathe pure oxygen, allowing the blood to carry more of it than usual to damaged tissues and accelerate healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lifesaving, the radiation used to destroy his cancer caused Garza to lose half of his anal sphincter. This may later lead to pain and issues controlling bowel movements. To combat this, Garza was fitted in April 2016 with an ostomy bag, which diverts waste from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza stayed on maintenance treatments until 2017, when he was declared cancer free. Doctors believe his chance of the cancer returning is slim, but he undergoes regular blood tests to check for elevated tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and to keep an eye on his HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza said anal cancer has, however, changed his relationship with his partner, who was also his main caregiver during treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garza has now shifted his advocacy work to focus on both HIV and anal cancer. He is the director of outreach at Cheeky Charity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a partner becomes a caregiver, there is this new connection between the patient and the caregiver, because you have to put aside the relationship part,' Garza told the Daily Mail. 'It changed the way we saw each other mentally because we both went through this journey together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to Garza's body has also made intimacy a challenge for the couple, though he said they have adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza has also shifted his advocacy work to focus not just on HIV but on anal cancer and other forms of the disease that are more prevalent among the HIV-positive community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I participate in HIV conferences, I go to cancer conferences,' he said. 'I've done some research and study conferences. I've added information about HPV, mental health, body dysmorphia, sexuality - my story has grown.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also encouraged others experiencing symptoms like anal bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating to seek a second opinion if they feel dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't ignore the signs,' he told the Daily Mail. 'If you know something's going on and you've done all the recommendations and it's still happening, get a second opinion. It's okay to offend your doctor a bit, as long as it's about your body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Having colorblindness could be even more of a disadvantage than commonly thought. Research published this month might indicate that colorblind people are less able to literally spot certain cancers before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford University and others examined the medical records of people with color blindness and cancer. Compared to others, colorblind people had a higher chance of not surviving their bladder cancer, they found. The results suggest that individuals with colorblindness often don’t perceive blood in their urine, the researchers say—a key early warning sign of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m hopeful that this study raises some awareness, not only for patients with colorblindness, but for our colleagues who see these patients,” senior study author Ehsan Rahimy, adjunct clinical associate professor of ophthalmology, &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2026/01/colorblindness-bladder-cancer-mortality-risk-study-research"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Stanford Report over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A color disadvantage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorblindness, or color vision deficiency, is relatively common, though much more so in men. About 8% of men are &lt;a href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to have some degree of colorblindness, compared to 0.5% of women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most cases are caused by genetic mutations, and the condition comes in several forms depending on how a person’s cone cells function abnormally. Our cones normally recognize blue, red, and green light and send corresponding signals to the brain; the perception of other colors then comes from the mixing and interpretation of these signals by the brain. That said, many colorblind people tend to have trouble seeing both red and green.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s sometimes so mild that people will go years or even their entire lives without knowing they have it. But some case reports and small studies have hinted that colorblind people have a worse time on average when they develop bladder or colorectal cancer. Since these cancers regularly cause blood to show up in urine or stool (often without pain) before more apparent symptoms, some researchers have hypothesized that colorblind people simply don’t see these early indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To better unravel this potential phenomenon, the researchers examined a large database of electronic health records. They analyzed the records of 136 colorblind people diagnosed with bladder cancer, as well as 187 colorblind people with colorectal cancer. Both groups were compared to similar non-colorblind people with these cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorblind people with bladder cancer lived shorter lives compared to their non-colorblind counterparts, the researchers found. Over a 20-year span, colorblind people with bladder cancer had a 52% higher risk of dying in general. Interestingly, though, there was no apparent difference in survival between colorblind and non-colorblind people who had colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t exactly sure why this pattern was only seen with bladder cancer. But they note that colorectal cancer can cause other early, noticeable symptoms besides a bloody stool, including chronic diarrhea or constipation. The average person is routinely advised to start getting screened for colorectal cancer as early as &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html"&gt;age 45&lt;/a&gt;, which could reduce the time it takes for people with colorblindness to notice something wrong compared to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What should this mean for colorblind people?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers caution their findings shouldn’t be seen as definitive proof of a causative link between colorblindness and worse outcomes for bladder cancer. Nor are they calling for radical changes in the advice that doctors give to such individuals, at least right now. But the study does warrant further research and awareness of the potential perception gap that colorblind people might face with these cancers, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is a hypothesis-generating paper that should raise clinicians’ diagnostic suspicion for bladder cancer in patients with color vision deficiency and prompt further investigation into whether screening for bladder cancer should be introduced for high-risk individuals with color vision deficiency,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44360-025-00032-7"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in Nature Health.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

New research suggests that one of the best things you can do to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/3-exercises-may-improve-brain-health-as-you-age-new-research-8363823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;keep your mind sharp as you age&lt;/a&gt; may be as simple as lacing up your sneakers and going for a brisk walk.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists have long known that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cycling-lower-dementia-risk-study-11757686" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity is linked to better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; later in life. Studies have connected regular movement with improved memory, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-cognitive-decline-study-11782889" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sharper thinking&lt;/a&gt; and even a reduced risk of dementia. What's been less clear is whether exercise can actually change the physical structure of the brain—and whether these changes show up on scans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A team of researchers from the AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh wanted to find out. They designed a year-long clinical trial to examine whether following &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;standard exercise guidelines&lt;/a&gt; could slow or even reverse something called "brain age"—a measure of how old your brain looks on an MRI compared to your actual age. The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/em&gt;. Let's break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers recruited 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58 for a single-blind, 12-month randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise group or a control group that was asked not to change their activity levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those in the exercise group attended two &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supervised 60-minute workout sessions&lt;/a&gt; each week in a laboratory setting and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. That’s the amount recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Participants could &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-walking-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise-11743962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walk, jog or run on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, or use equipment like bikes, elliptical machines or rowers. Heart rate monitors tracked their exercise intensity throughout the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the start and end of the study, researchers measured participants' brain structure using MRI scans and assessed their cardiorespiratory fitness through a test called peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Using a machine learning tool called brainageR, they calculated each person's "brain-predicted age difference," or brain-PAD—essentially, how much older or younger the brain appeared compared to the person's chronological age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After 12 months, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants in the exercise group showed a measurable decrease in brain age—their brains looked about 0.6 years younger at the end of the study compared to the beginning. Meanwhile, the control group showed a slight increase in brain age (about 0.35 years older), though this change wasn't statistically significant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the researchers compared the two groups directly, the gap was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group. Unsurprisingly, the exercise group also showed &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939026/encouraging-news-study-finds-physical-activity-not-weight-loss-key-reducing-health-risks/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant improvements in fitness&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the researchers also found that higher fitness levels at the start of the study were associated with younger-looking brains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are some important limitations to keep in mind. The study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers, and the sample size was modest. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected participation, as some people had to continue exercising at home during shutdowns. Additionally, while the researchers explored potential explanations for why exercise improved brain age—including changes in fitness, body composition, blood pressure and a brain protein called BDNF—none of these factors fully explained the effect. The exact mechanism remains unknown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?’ Our findings support the idea that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/movement-for-longevity-study-11773321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;following current exercise guidelines&lt;/a&gt;—150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity—may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife," senior author and neuroscientist Kirk I. Erickson, Ph.D., says in a press release.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The focus on midlife is particularly important. Many studies on exercise and brain health have concentrated on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This study suggests that starting earlier—in your 30s, 40s and 50s—may offer greater benefits over time by giving your brain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-women-in-their-20s-should-start-for-healthy-aging-11708753" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;head start against aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're not currently meeting the 150-minute-per-week recommendation, don't worry. You can start where you are. Try adding short walks throughout your day, taking the stairs instead of the elevator or scheduling a few sessions at the gym each week. Activities like brisk walking, cycling, swimming and dancing all count as moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise. The key is consistency: participants in this study exercised regularly for a full year to see results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have any health conditions or haven't exercised in a while, talk to your health care provider before starting a new fitness routine. They can help you create a plan that's safe, approachable and effective for your individual needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/em&gt; suggests that following basic aerobic exercise guidelines—150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous activity—can make your brain appear measurably younger on MRI scans. After one year, adults who exercised regularly showed brains that looked nearly a year younger than those who didn't change their habits. While the changes were modest, researchers believe that even small shifts in brain age during midlife could add up to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meaningful protection against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; later on. So if you've been looking for motivation to move more, consider this: your brain will thank you.

"We will continue to follow the science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The AAP continues to broadly recommend routine immunization against RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, flu and meningococcal disease. Twelve major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed its recommendations, including the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In contrast, the updated CDC schedule narrowed recommendations for protection against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections. It also recommends that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on "shared clinical decision-making," which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent," US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said after the vaccine schedule update. "This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There were no safety issues or new research to suggest that the vaccines on the CDC's previous schedule weren't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government," said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases. "Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The half-dozen pediatricians who spoke with CNN they said they'll stick with the AAP's guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sarah Elizabeth DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children's National in Washington, DC, says that she will continue to share "very candidly" with families about vaccines and that "we know they're safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When the CDC's vaccine schedule changed this month, she said, it undermined some parents' confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have families that come into our clinic that traditionally have been very accepting of vaccines and they want to know, 'is this new recommendation, is this evidence-based, or do I need to think differently about these vaccines' that they've accepted previously?" DeRoo said. "We've been giving messaging to our patients that we're continuing to follow the recommended schedule by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is an evidence- based schedule."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The disconnect between advice from the CDC and from doctors has confused and even scared some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We are seeing the vaccine conversation come up more and more frequently because of fear of this and general misinformation spreading online," said Dr. Nina Alfieri, Continuity Clinic director with Lurie Children's Pediatrics at Uptown in Chicago. "We always want families to feel welcome coming to clinic with their questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU, said he gets why parents are asking more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We've had so many years of the CDC being a reliable source of information," he said. "It's understandable why families are confused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Historically, states have followed CDC recommendations, but most say they will now follow AAP recommendations instead, according to KFF, a health policy organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of January 20, KFF found, 28 states were giving advice that deviates from federal guidelines for some or all childhood vaccines. Although it's not clear how states will handle vaccine requirements for schools, what is clear is that there is a real blue/red divide on which vaccine advice to follow, according to Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All states with Democratic governors have announced that they won't follow federal guidelines. Only four states led by Republicans have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For the first time in our country, we're going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live," Kates said. "It's a major sea change in public health policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hoyen, of UH Rainbow Babies and Children's, has been practicing medicine for 30 years and said she doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine days. She remembers a colleague who was deaf in one ear because of a childhood case of mumps and another in the same class who was deaf in one ear because of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meningitis was so common before the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine came into use in 1987, she remembers, that pediatricians routinely kept spinal tap equipment on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They'd do the taps in the office, give them a dose of penicillin or whatever and send them straight to the hospital," Hoyen said. "There's a reason why these vaccines were created. It's to help kids thrive and not to have to worry about complications from these childhood illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;O'Leary also doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine era. He trained to be a doctor in the 1990s, before there was a vaccine against rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We had three seasons. In the winter, we had influenza season, we had RSV season, and we had rotavirus season. Heaven forbid if they all hit at the same time, because we'd be overwhelmed. Now, we don't have a rotavirus season, and we're seeing a very big impact on RSV season with the new product," O'Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;DeRoo, who has only been caring for children during what she called "the vaccine era," says she's been trying to refresh her knowledge of what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have to rethink how we're approaching people who walk in and are sick in the clinic, to make sure that we take all the appropriate precautions in the event that they may not be fully immunized," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ratner said a measles outbreak in New York a few years ago was the first time many of his colleagues had ever seen a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think, given the way that things are going in this country, that is likely to change," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The idea of going backwards is horrifying because you don't want to lose hard-won progress, but also because we're not talking about something abstract," Ratner said.

Twelve major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed its recommendations, including the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In contrast, the updated CDC schedule narrowed recommendations for protection against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections. It also recommends that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on "shared clinical decision-making," which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent," US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said after the vaccine schedule update. "This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There were no safety issues or new research to suggest that the vaccines on the CDC's previous schedule weren't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government," said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases. "Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The half-dozen pediatricians who spoke with CNN they said they'll stick with the AAP's guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sarah Elizabeth DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children's National in Washington, DC, says that she will continue to share "very candidly" with families about vaccines and that "we know they're safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When the CDC's vaccine schedule changed this month, she said, it undermined some parents' confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have families that come into our clinic that traditionally have been very accepting of vaccines and they want to know, 'is this new recommendation, is this evidence-based, or do I need to think differently about these vaccines' that they've accepted previously?" DeRoo said. "We've been giving messaging to our patients that we're continuing to follow the recommended schedule by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is an evidence- based schedule."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The disconnect between advice from the CDC and from doctors has confused and even scared some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We are seeing the vaccine conversation come up more and more frequently because of fear of this and general misinformation spreading online," said Dr. Nina Alfieri, Continuity Clinic director with Lurie Children's Pediatrics at Uptown in Chicago. "We always want families to feel welcome coming to clinic with their questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU, said he gets why parents are asking more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We've had so many years of the CDC being a reliable source of information," he said. "It's understandable why families are confused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Historically, states have followed CDC recommendations, but most say they will now follow AAP recommendations instead, according to KFF, a health policy organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of January 20, KFF found, 28 states were giving advice that deviates from federal guidelines for some or all childhood vaccines. Although it's not clear how states will handle vaccine requirements for schools, what is clear is that there is a real blue/red divide on which vaccine advice to follow, according to Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All states with Democratic governors have announced that they won't follow federal guidelines. Only four states led by Republicans have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For the first time in our country, we're going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live," Kates said. "It's a major sea change in public health policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hoyen, of UH Rainbow Babies and Children's, has been practicing medicine for 30 years and said she doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine days. She remembers a colleague who was deaf in one ear because of a childhood case of mumps and another in the same class who was deaf in one ear because of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meningitis was so common before the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine came into use in 1987, she remembers, that pediatricians routinely kept spinal tap equipment on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They'd do the taps in the office, give them a dose of penicillin or whatever and send them straight to the hospital," Hoyen said. "There's a reason why these vaccines were created. It's to help kids thrive and not to have to worry about complications from these childhood illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;O'Leary also doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine era. He trained to be a doctor in the 1990s, before there was a vaccine against rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We had three seasons. In the winter, we had influenza season, we had RSV season, and we had rotavirus season. Heaven forbid if they all hit at the same time, because we'd be overwhelmed. Now, we don't have a rotavirus season, and we're seeing a very big impact on RSV season with the new product," O'Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;DeRoo, who has only been caring for children during what she called "the vaccine era," says she's been trying to refresh her knowledge of what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have to rethink how we're approaching people who walk in and are sick in the clinic, to make sure that we take all the appropriate precautions in the event that they may not be fully immunized," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ratner said a measles outbreak in New York a few years ago was the first time many of his colleagues had ever seen a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think, given the way that things are going in this country, that is likely to change," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The idea of going backwards is horrifying because you don't want to lose hard-won progress, but also because we're not talking about something abstract," Ratner said. "We're talking about actual children and families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp;  2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkr6e5ga001w2cnk795p3ara@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fast-growing measles outbreak in South Carolina is now the largest in the United States since the disease was declared eliminated in this country more than two decades ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87q00043b6s5tm6zaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, the South Carolina outbreak surpassed a massive outbreak in Texas, which reached 762 cases before it ended in August last year. Two children died during the outbreak in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87r00053b6ssqgaimdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina, which first reported cases in October, has added more than 600 cases in 2026 alone. At least 18 people – adults and children – have been hospitalized for complications of measles, the state health department said Tuesday, and no deaths have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwy1brr00003b6rdwrtk2p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are an additional 557 people in quarantine in South Carolina, meaning they may have been exposed to measles and don’t have immunity to it through vaccination or prior infection. The health department reported exposures at three additional schools Tuesday, on top of existing quarantines among students at 20 others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwwmez800003b6sui0181yu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina and Washington have also been linked to the South Carolina outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000b3b6st1b0uvzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000c3b6s48sjsvg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before 2025, there were an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since elimination, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000d3b6sn04kondx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that there have been 416 confirmed measles cases reported in the US so far in 2026, but its update included data up until Thursday, before South Carolina’s latest numbers came in. At least 14 states have reported a confirmed measles case so far this year, and another large outbreak continues to grow along the Arizona-Utah border.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000e3b6sefxjhxrc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The spread of measles over the past year has left the US at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/health/measles-elimination-investigation"&gt;risk of losing elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which the Pan American Health Organization could decide to revoke when it meets in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000f3b6smuntsyv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC previously &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; measles elimination “a historic public health achievement,” possible in large part because of vaccination.The measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000g3b6shbfzjgss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previously, the country’s elimination status was threatened in 2019, amid &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxks2x00093b6siyiki2x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, the federal government’s posture toward measles has changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000l3b6suk3z4dp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former Louisiana surgeon general who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;ended &lt;/a&gt;some &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in his state before &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-principal-deputy-director.html" target="_blank"&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; his new post late last year, argued last week that ongoing measles transmission from the Texas outbreak, which started in January 2025, has not been proved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000m3b6s5ojaok0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, Abraham said the loss of measles elimination status would “not really” be significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000n3b6s0cpsoc06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders,” Abraham told reporters in a briefing. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000o3b6stl68lg99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Abraham added that “vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles” and said the CDC is “here to help,” but they’re willing to listen to alternatives “for treatment and prevention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000p3b6spk90rb55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the South Carolina outbreak are among children, nearly all of whom were not fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine. Of the 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, more than 700 were not vaccinated or had not received the two recommended MMR doses, the health department said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000q3b6sy3k6rfc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have been encouraging vaccination, including through facilitating mobile health unit vaccination events, to try to contain the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000r3b6slq85frsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak, 90% of students had required immunizations in the 2024-25 school year, among the lowest vaccination rates in the state, according to state &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; – with some schools there reporting much lower rates. Public health experts say a 95% vaccination rate is typically needed to keep measles from spreading in a community because the virus is so contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000s3b6s39ku09t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is widely available at doctors’ offices, pharmacies and health departments, and is free for many families through the Vaccines for Children program or health insurance, State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000t3b6s6ybec8no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As we continue to watch this daily surge in cases, [the Department of Public Health] strongly encourages those who are not protected to take advantage of the opportunity to get protected against unexpected exposures and illnesses now to help us stop this outbreak and to help us protect our communities,” Bell said.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California San Diego have discovered a path between the brain and the immune system that could potentially lead to new ways to ease heart attacks. They showed that disabling specific parts of that circuit could profoundly improve outcomes in mice with experimentally induced heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The injury almost disappears," says UCSD neuroscientist&lt;a href="https://theaugustinelab.org/" target="_blank"&gt; Vineet Augustine&lt;/a&gt;, who led the new &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01506-5?rss=yes" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appearing Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may not seem obvious how neuroimmune crosstalk relates to heart disease, links between the nervous and immune systems have captivated researchers for decades. Some researchers have focused on the vagus nerve, a huge bundle of fibers that carries signals between the brain and other organs to control breathing, blood pressure, digestion and other involuntary functions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A key discovery came in 2000 when researchers at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research on Long Island, New York, showed that electrically stimulating the vagus nerve in rats curbed production of an immune protein that drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Last July, an implantable&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5272748/vagus-nerve-stimulation-may-tame-autoimmune-diseases" target="_blank"&gt; vagus nerve stimulator&lt;/a&gt; developed by SetPoint Medical — a company co-founded by Dr.&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md" target="_blank"&gt; Kevin Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Feinstein Institutes — earned FDA approval as a treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research had also found striking links between the cardiovascular system and the nervous and immune systems. On the day of the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake, the number of&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199602153340701" target="_blank"&gt; sudden cardiac deaths&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles County rose more than fivefold. Similar spikes occur with high-stakes sporting events. During stressful moments, the heart rate shoots up to protect us.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The brain says, hey, get up and run, you're going to die," says Dr.&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/kalyanam-shivkumar" target="_blank"&gt; Kalyanam Shivkumar&lt;/a&gt;, a UCLA cardiac electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While such fight-or-flight signals help during emergencies, in the long term, they trigger harmful inflammation. "And then the heart swells up. You get arrhythmias and heart failure," says Shivkumar, who's leading an effort to create a&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4974797/the-anatomical-atlas-used-by-doctors-has-a-dark-history-one-man-is-pushing-for-change" target="_blank"&gt; new anatomical atlas&lt;/a&gt; of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current research from UCSD uses state-of-the-art tools from genetics and neuroscience to gain a more precise understanding of how the brain communicates with the heart and its role in heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It shows how the vagus nerve carries signals between the brain and the heart. Augustine says he found that during a heart attack in mice, certain vagal neurons (TRPV1 expressing neurons) "literally wrap around the injury site." His team wondered if blocking communication through those nerve cells could help slow or even prevent heart attacks in the lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It was a bold idea — one that some scientists told Augustine was "unreal" when he spoke about the project in its early stages four or five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiments were technically demanding and required multiple researchers to work long hours together — one performing heart surgery on the mice, another targeting specific cells in the brain, and others taking physiological measurements and conducting echocardiography to image the heart in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Minor errors at any step could have compromised the entire experiment," Saurabh Yadav, a postdoc in Augustine's lab and one of the paper's first authors, said via email. "There were moments when I wondered whether I had taken on too much or if this was simply too big a leap."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came an "incredibly encouraging" moment, Yadav told NPR. The team turned off this small group of TRPV1 nerve cells and saw striking improvements in pumping efficiency and electrical signals associated with heart contraction. And that was just the first victory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The TRPV1 neurons carry signals from the heart to the hypothalamus — a deep-brain structure that regulates body temperature, thirst, hunger and sleep. Other cells in the hypothalamus receive those signals and relay them to a different cluster of nerve cells that project back to the heart and unleash an immune protein that drives inflammation. Blocking any of the three junctures of the heart-brain-immune loop relieved heart attack complications in the mice, the UCSD team reports in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The findings in this paper are quite impressive," says&lt;a href="https://profiles.icahn.mssm.edu/cameron-s-mcalpine" target="_blank"&gt; Cameron McAlpine&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While he and others have long known that heart attacks trigger major changes in the immune and nervous systems, McAlpine says, it's only in the last five or six years that researchers have developed "tools and technologies that allow us to study this at a really deep level" — such as some of the genetic approaches for precisely manipulating the activity in specific groups of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, research in this area stalled because of a conceptual divide — the idea that the brain is the command center, sending signals to the rest of the body, Augustine says. Clinicians "focused on the organ itself, whereas the nervous system was kind of ignored," he adds. "That created a lot of silos." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, interest in the nervous and immune systems is surging. These systems "affect practically everything in your body," he says. "The field is really exploding."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the mouse findings are still years from entering human trials, it's possible that the approved vagus nerve stimulator could prove useful for heart attacks after further study, says &lt;a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/rollsasya" target="_blank"&gt;Asya Rolls&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Her team has shown that the&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-024-00491-3" target="_blank"&gt; brain's reward networks&lt;/a&gt; can regulate inflammation in mice in various settings including bacterial infections and cancer as well as heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In future experiments, Augustine says his team will flesh out the heart-brain-immune circuit by investigating, for example, what exactly the nerve cells are sensing and how they communicate with the heart cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 paper, McAlpine and colleagues report that heart attacks send immune cells into the brain to&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08100-w" target="_blank"&gt; promote deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The growing body of research illustrates how brain-immune connections can manifest differently across conditions — and "it's likely much more complex" than the specific pathways identified by each research team, Rolls told NPR via email. Each manipulation likely affects many other pathways such as blood flow, vascularization and metabolism. A National Institutes of Health program called&lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/SPARC" target="_blank"&gt; Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC&lt;/a&gt;) is funding research on stimulating neural circuits to relieve disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Shivkumar sees an emerging theme. "The message people should get is, oh my God, these scientists are doing something very exciting. But literally we are building on ancient knowledge," he says. Research on stimulating the vagus nerve supports "what the Buddha said: meditate. I call it Zen cardiology."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;People who don't eat meat may be less likely than meat eaters to reach the age of 100, according to a recent study. But before you reconsider your plant-based diet, there's more to these findings than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525007282?via%3Dihub"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; tracked over 5,000 Chinese adults aged 80 and older who participated in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, a nationally representative study that began in 1998. By 2018, those following diets that don't contain meat were less likely to become centenarians compared with meat eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this appears to contradict decades of research showing that plant-based diets are good for your health. Vegetarian diets, for example, have been consistently linked to lower risks of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-02942-8"&gt;heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.07.004"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/dc08-1886"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;. These benefits come partly from higher fiber intake and lower saturated fat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cutting-back-one-amino-acid-increased-the-lifespan-of-mice-up-to-33"&gt;Cutting Back on One Amino Acid Increased Lifespan of Mice Up to 33%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's going on? Before drawing any firm conclusions, there are several important factors to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your body's needs change as you age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on adults aged 80 and older, whose nutritional needs differ markedly from those of younger people. As we age, physiological changes alter both how much we eat and what nutrients we need. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2818133/"&gt;Energy expenditure drops&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.25001"&gt;muscle mass, bone density&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610203008779"&gt;appetite&lt;/a&gt; often decline. These shifts increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02612-5"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2016.12.074"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most evidence for the health benefits of diets that exclude meat comes from studies of younger adults rather than frail older populations. Some research suggests older non-meat eaters face a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01815-3"&gt;fractures&lt;/a&gt; due to lower calcium and protein intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180016" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Bright-Vegetables-on-Blue-.jpg" alt="Variety of vegetables on a blue background" class="size-full wp-image-180016" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Bright-Vegetables-on-Blue-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Bright-Vegetables-on-Blue--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180016" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The benefits of vegetarian diets come partly from higher fiber intake and lower saturated fat consumption.

Rather than focusing on preventing long-term diseases, the goal becomes maintaining muscle mass, preventing weight loss, and ensuring every mouthful delivers plenty of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings may, therefore, reflect the nutritional challenges of advanced age, rather than any inherent problems with plant-based diets. Crucially, this doesn't diminish the well-established health benefits of these diets for younger and healthier adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-on-worlds-oldest-woman-confirms-how-to-live-past-100"&gt;Study on World's Oldest Woman Confirms How to Live Past 100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a crucial detail: the lower likelihood of reaching 100 among non-meat eaters was only observed in underweight participants. No such association was found in older adults of healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being underweight in older age is already strongly linked with increased risks of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2024.105467"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj114"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Body weight therefore appears to be a key factor in explaining these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth remembering that this was an observational study, meaning it shows associations rather than cause and effect. Just because two things occur together doesn't mean one causes the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also align with the so-called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15071780"&gt;"obesity paradox"&lt;/a&gt; in aging, where a slightly higher body weight is often associated with better survival in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the reduced likelihood of reaching 100 observed among non-meat eaters was not evident in those who included fish, dairy, or eggs in their diets. These foods provide nutrients that are essential for maintaining muscle and bone health, including high-quality protein,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="190226" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B12, calcium, and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults following these diets were just as likely to live to 100 as meat eaters. The researchers suggested that including modest amounts of animal-source foods may help prevent undernutrition and loss of lean muscle mass in very old age, compared with strictly plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for healthy ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on whether one diet is universally better than another, the key message is that nutrition should be tailored to your stage of life. Energy needs decline with age (due to decreased resting energy expenditure), but some nutrient requirements increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults still require adequate protein, vitamin B12, calcium, and vitamin D – especially to preserve muscle mass and prevent frailty. In older adulthood, preventing malnutrition and weight loss often becomes more important than long-term chronic disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;People Who Live to 100 Have a Unique Relationship With Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based diets can still be healthy choices, but they may require careful planning and, in some cases, supplementation to ensure nutritional adequacy, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-017-0194-x"&gt;particularly in later life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that our nutritional needs at 90 may look very different from those at 50, and dietary advice should reflect these changes across the lifespan. What works for you now might need adjusting as you age – and that's perfectly normal.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/273861/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating an anti-inflammatory lunch every day for a week helped a dietitian reduce brain fog. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She also felt more energized, mentally sharper and better focused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To try it, build your meal around veggies, whole grains, beans, healthy fats and lean protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a registered dietitian who works from home, my days are packed with juggling my workload while attempting to sneak in a workout, drink enough water, and generally do all the things we are “supposed” to do to support our health. While I’m passionate about nutrition, the daily realities of work don’t allow for much time to spend prepping elaborate lunches. Still, I know firsthand how much our food choices impact not only our bodies but also our energy, focus and long-term health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lately, I’ve been reflecting on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;how inflammation ties into all of this&lt;/a&gt;—how it’s not just triggered by illness but also by the stressors and habits we face every day. So, what is inflammation, and why does it matter? &lt;a href="https://www.christinaychu.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christina Chu, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, puts it well: “Inflammation is, in simple terms, damage to the body.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It can be triggered by certain medical conditions, and it can also be caused by the foods you do–or don’t–eat, she says.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Consuming a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods can protect the body from everyday damage and ultimately prevent diseases,” she explains.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, and knowing I needed quick, realistic options, I challenged myself to eat an anti-inflammatory lunch every day for a week, just to see what would happen. I expected to feel a little more spring in my step during this journey. But what I didn’t expect was that my typical afternoon brain fog almost completely disappeared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-surprising-benefit-i-noticed-a-clearer-mind"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Surprising Benefit I Noticed: A Clearer Mind &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Around 3 p.m. each day, a familiar mental haze used to settle in. My focus would drift, my productivity would plummet, and my ability to form a coherent thought felt like wading through mud. I’d often reach for another coffee or a sugary snack to power through, but it was always a temporary fix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After a few days of my &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/three-step-anti-inflammatory-lunch-recipes-8387781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory lunch experiment&lt;/a&gt;, I realized my afternoons felt different. The usual slump was replaced with a steady, sustained energy. My mind felt sharper, and I was able to stay focused on tasks without feeling that familiar mental strain. It turns out this wasn't just a coincidence. The foods I was eating were directly impacting my cognitive function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/50623/7-of-the-healthiest-foods-you-should-be-eating-but-arent/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in my new lunch choices were &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-packed-foods-11813913" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in antioxidants and polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;. These compounds help combat oxidative stress, a key driver of inflammation throughout the body and the brain.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By reducing this inflammation, I was essentially creating a better environment for my brain to function optimally. The high-fiber content of my lunch also helped &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stabilize my blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the dramatic spikes and crashes that often lead to energy slumps and mental fatigue.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-i-ate-for-lunch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What I Ate for Lunch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The anti-inflammatory diet is really just simple whole foods. Think about counting colors instead of calories and you're half way there,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nourishedbyanne.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anne Murray, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. And she’s right. Committing to an anti-inflammatory lunch was easier than I thought. I prepped a few key recipes at the start of the week, which made grabbing a healthy meal simple and stress-free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To keep things easy, I made these three dishes on repeat, and I loved every bite. Here’s a look at what I ate:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was the easiest meal of the week. I just tossed all the ingredients together for a fresh, satisfying lunch. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;white beans provided plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, while the spinach and tomatoes offered a powerful dose of antioxidants. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8003928/regular-vs-extra-virgin-olive-oil-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; in the dressing gave me healthy monounsaturated fats and oleocanthal, a compound with potent anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A hearty salad, like this, was perfect for days when I needed something more substantial. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy-8400304" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet potatoes are a source of beta-carotene&lt;/a&gt;, an antioxidant that supports overall health and helps combat inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kale, a nutrient powerhouse that contains vitamins A, C and K, is known for its anti-inflammatory properties as well.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The chicken provided lean protein to keep me fueled, while the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-eating-almonds-11794303" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;almonds added healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, a satisfying crunch, and additional inflammation-taming antioxidants.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The tahini-based dressing brought in even more healthy fats and nutrients.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This warm, comforting soup was a perfect meal for a cooler day. Butternut squash is rich in antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamins A and C.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils are a source of fiber&lt;/a&gt; and plant-based protein, which helps with satiety and blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To top it all off, a dollop of non-fat plain (Greek style) yogurt delivered additional blood-sugar-leveling protein.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-to-eat-an-anti-inflammatory-lunch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Tips to Eat an Anti-Inflammatory Lunch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating more anti-inflammatory foods into your day may sound daunting, but it’s actually much easier than you might expect. Here are a few simple tips to get started: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include healthy fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid of fat! Incorporate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sources of omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, such as salmon, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fat-for-heart-health-8644218" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;monounsaturated fats like avocados&lt;/a&gt;, olive oil and nuts. These fats are essential for fighting inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="15" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars and refined carbs:&lt;/strong&gt; Foods high in added sugar and refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pastries and sugary drinks) can promote inflammation. Try swapping them for whole-grain alternatives and naturally sweet fruits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace herbs and spices:&lt;/strong&gt; Turmeric, ginger and cardamom are just a few of the many spices with powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Be generous with them in your cooking to boost flavor and tackle inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="16" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the rainbow:&lt;/strong&gt; Colorful fruits and vegetables provide a wide array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Aiming to include a variety of colors on your plate ensures you’re getting a broad range of protective compounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating an intentional anti-inflammatory lunch is one of the best ways to make a small change into your daily routine,” says Murray. And I found the experience to be transformative. This one-week experiment was a powerful reminder of how directly our food choices impact how we feel, not just physically but mentally. By focusing on one meal, I was able to see a tangible benefit in my daily life without feeling overwhelmed by completely overhauling my meals. In my case, the habit is likely to stick! The disappearance of my afternoon brain fog gave me the motivation I needed to continue making these small, positive changes. Give it a try. You may never go back to the same old lunch again.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9KQnZpMDhiTEo4WEsxbXNERkxkeDFoSnRTUnF0aUpTUG5BSFg0cEsxRDhHQkd2TFNRTktFV0dUMzhxVjQxQVZYMExRUE1HVEVhbE5oSVhJMUtMS2ZUNEM3WEVXZkNUMlVFd3Mwa0NHemhUbG84d21PREhEbVY3OGc</guid></item><item><title>新的阿尔茨海默病发现揭示了大脑中隐藏的“擦除”开关-印度国防评论</title><link>https://indiandefencereview.com/alzheimer-discovery-reveals-a-hidden-erase/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content dynamic-entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a potential mechanism behind memory loss in &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt; that involves neurons pruning their own synapses, not being passively destroyed. The process appears to be triggered by a single receptor that responds to both &lt;strong&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;inflammatory molecules&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting these two longstanding culprits might actually work through the same destructive pathway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery reframes how Alzheimer’s disease might be causing damage, and potentially how it should be treated. Researchers now believe that stopping memory loss may depend not on breaking up &lt;strong&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/strong&gt;, as most current drugs attempt, but on protecting the &lt;strong&gt;synaptic connections&lt;/strong&gt; themselves from being erased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Unifying Explanation for Memory Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease has long been linked to various biological threats: &lt;strong&gt;amyloid beta plaques&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tau tangles&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;brain inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;. Each seemed to independently play a role in damaging neurons. But now, a team led by &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/carla-shatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Carla Shatz&lt;/a&gt;, professor of biology and neurobiology at Stanford, has identified a &lt;strong&gt;shared receptor&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;LilrB2&lt;/em&gt;) that appears to act as the common target of both amyloid beta and inflammatory proteins. As reported by Stanford’s Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, the finding offers a way to connect two major Alzheimer’s theories through a single molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/c4d-binds-tightly-to-lilrb2-and-pirb-triggering-synapse-pruning-via-high-affinity-receptor-interaction-pnas-1200x727.jpg" alt="C4d Binds Tightly To Lilrb2 And Pirb, Triggering Synapse Pruning Via High Affinity Receptor Interaction ©pnas" class="wp-image-105482" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/c4d-binds-tightly-to-lilrb2-and-pirb-triggering-synapse-pruning-via-high-affinity-receptor-interaction-pnas-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/c4d-binds-tightly-to-lilrb2-and-pirb-triggering-synapse-pruning-via-high-affinity-receptor-interaction-pnas-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/c4d-binds-tightly-to-lilrb2-and-pirb-triggering-synapse-pruning-via-high-affinity-receptor-interaction-pnas-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;C4d binds tightly to LilrB2 and PirB, triggering synapse pruning via high-affinity receptor interaction ©PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key lies in &lt;strong&gt;synapse pruning&lt;/strong&gt;, a process typically associated with brain development, where unnecessary synapses are eliminated to fine-tune neural circuits. In adult brains, this process is supposed to slow down, but in Alzheimer’s, it seems to go haywire. The receptor LilrB2 tells neurons when to remove synapses, and when hijacked by amyloid or inflammation-related proteins, it appears to &lt;strong&gt;initiate excessive synaptic loss&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amyloid and Inflammation Converge on the Same Receptor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013, Shatz’s team showed that amyloid beta binds directly to LilrB2, triggering neurons to dismantle their own connections. The new study deepens this connection by showing that a fragment of a complement protein, called &lt;strong&gt;C4d&lt;/strong&gt;, also binds to this receptor with high affinity. According to findings published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, both amyloid beta and C4d may use LilrB2 as a &lt;strong&gt;common entry point&lt;/strong&gt; to induce memory-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing this hypothesis, scientists injected &lt;strong&gt;C4d&lt;/strong&gt; into the brains of healthy mice. The result was dramatic: synapses were stripped from neurons, replicating the kind of damage seen in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-just-reversed-alzheimers-mice/" data-type="post" data-id="100991"&gt;Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;’s. “&lt;em&gt;Lo and behold, it stripped synapses off neurons&lt;/em&gt;,” said Shatz. This wasn’t a passive process, it was triggered by &lt;strong&gt;neurons themselves&lt;/strong&gt; responding to signals via LilrB2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-c4d-triggers-synapse-loss-dual-pathway-model-pnas-1200x727.jpg" alt="How C4d Triggers Synapse Loss Dual Pathway Model ©pnas" class="wp-image-105483" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-c4d-triggers-synapse-loss-dual-pathway-model-pnas-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-c4d-triggers-synapse-loss-dual-pathway-model-pnas-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-c4d-triggers-synapse-loss-dual-pathway-model-pnas-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How C4d Triggers Synapse Loss: Dual Pathway Model ©PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly surprising is that C4d had previously been considered &lt;strong&gt;biologically irrelevant&lt;/strong&gt;. But this &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519253122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;reveals it plays a direct role in memory loss by actively engaging the same receptor as amyloid beta, reinforcing the theory that both pathologies share a &lt;strong&gt;single destructive signaling route&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurons Take the Lead in Self-Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The traditional view has been that immune cells, especially &lt;strong&gt;microglia&lt;/strong&gt;, are the main actors in synapse loss during neurodegeneration. But these findings flip that narrative: neurons are not bystanders, according to Shatz. They receive external cues and then make the choice to prune their own synapses, a striking demonstration of &lt;strong&gt;cell-autonomous action&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was made evident in experiments using &lt;strong&gt;PirB knockout mice&lt;/strong&gt;, PirB being the mouse equivalent of human LilrB2. When C4d was introduced into these genetically altered mice, &lt;strong&gt;no synapse loss occurred&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike in normal mice. This confirmed that the receptor was necessary for the observed pruning effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, data from human brain samples analyzed using high-resolution array tomography showed that LilrB2 and C4d both&lt;strong&gt; localize at excitatory synapses&lt;/strong&gt;, the very junctions responsible for learning and memory. In Alzheimer’s brains, these molecules were often found &lt;strong&gt;alongside amyloid beta&lt;/strong&gt;, especially near plaques, further linking the trio at the site of damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Treatments May Be Missing the Mark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;FDA-approved Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/strong&gt; target amyloid plaques in the brain. But their effectiveness has been limited, and some, like lecanemab, have been associated with &lt;strong&gt;serious side effects&lt;/strong&gt;, including brain bleeding and swelling. “&lt;em&gt;Busting up amyloid plaques hasn’t worked that well&lt;/em&gt;,” said Shatz. “&lt;em&gt;And even if they worked well, you’re only going to solve part of the problem&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, this new research suggests that directly protecting &lt;strong&gt;synapses from LilrB2 signaling&lt;/strong&gt; could be a more promising direction. Amyloid beta and inflammation may just be &lt;strong&gt;triggers&lt;/strong&gt;, while LilrB2 is the actual &lt;strong&gt;executioner&lt;/strong&gt;, and possibly the better target for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As inflammation and amyloid both increase with age and Alzheimer’s progression, understanding their convergence on this receptor may open doors to a new class of treatments aimed not at the plaques themselves, but at preserving the memory pathways they threaten to erase.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Mainstream doctors aren’t backing down from a fight with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The American Academy of Pediatrics has just released its own recommendations for which vaccines children and teens should receive—with some notable differences from the version recently tabled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its childhood vaccine schedule on Monday, with the endorsement of 12 other medical organizations and groups, including the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. The recommendations are in line with the AAP’s prior guidance but contain several vaccines no longer universally recommended by RFK Jr.’s CDC, including the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” said AAP President Andrew Racine in a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the organization. “Routine childhood immunizations are an important early step in the path to lifelong health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tried and tested&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, RFK Jr. and the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-rfk-jr-are-officially-tearing-down-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-2000705661"&gt;abruptly removed&lt;/a&gt; several vaccines from the recommended childhood vaccination schedule—a longstanding goal of the anti-vaccination movement. The CDC now only endorses childhood vaccines for 11 diseases, down from the 18 diseases previously recommended by the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes supposedly align the U.S. with other peer countries, federal officials have said, but the new schedule actually only copies that of Denmark—which vaccinates against 10 diseases—with one addition, chickenpox. Those left on the cutting room floor included hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, RSV, flu, and meningococcal disease. The CDC had previously removed the covid-19 vaccine from its routine schedule last year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time lambasted the changes and the rationale behind them. Many countries recommend more childhood vaccines than Denmark does, including Canada, Japan, and Germany. Denmark’s schedule is also influenced by factors specific to the country and not the U.S., such as a universal health care system that better screens for diseases like hepatitis B. Vaccines for these diseases are now only recommended for high-risk groups or as part of a “shared clinical decision-making” process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, there is no solid evidence that the timing and amount of vaccines previously recommended by the CDC posed any added risk to children’s health. And studies have continuously rebuffed antivaxxers’ &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; made about specific routine vaccines, such as a supposed link between autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine (still on the current schedule).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s schedule covers the same diseases previously recommended by the CDC. It also maintains a recommendation for children to get two doses of the HPV vaccine starting as early as ages 9 to 12, as opposed to the CDC’s new recommendation of one dose at age 11 or 12 (while some research has suggested one dose can provide effective protection, this strategy is still being evaluated, the AAP said).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AAP recommends immunizations that have been designed to teach the immune system to recognize and resist serious diseases,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement. “They are carefully tested and monitored over time. The pacing and combination of vaccines are based on what we know about when your child’s immune system is ready to learn and respond best.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The growing resistance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s new schedule is the most recent sign that doctors and local health officials won’t easily go along with RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While states have long relied on the CDC’s guidance to shape their vaccine policy, for instance, numerous state health departments have formed their own coalitions during the second Trump term and have &lt;a href="https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-10_hepatitis_b_votes.htm"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that they will not carry out the changes endorsed by RFK Jr.’s CDC. The AAP and other organizations have also &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; lawsuits against the Trump administration for past abrupt shifts to its vaccine policy and are now &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34241"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; the latest changes in court, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the time being, though, it appears that RFK Jr. and his allies will continue to push the envelope in their agenda against vaccines. Over the weekend, Kirk Miloan, chair of the CDC’s advisory vaccine committee—a panel unilaterally reshaped by RFK Jr. last year—&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chair-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-questions-polio-shot/story?id=129580522"&gt;questioned &lt;/a&gt;whether Americans still needed vaccines for polio and measles. Notably, the U.S. is in the midst of a measles resurgence, one that might soon cause the country to lose its official measles-free status.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty industry has a way of convincing us that better skin always costs more money, more steps and more patience than we actually have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B01MDTVZTZ" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOrdinary-Niacinamide-10-Zinc-30ml%2Fdp%2FB01MDTVZTZ%3Fref_%3Dpb_hm_dp%26th%3D1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2026%2F01%2F27%2Fshopping%2Fthis-6-serum-delivers-results-and-has-thousands-of-fans%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum&lt;/a&gt; proves the opposite, sitting on shelves at a $6 price tag and with a reputation you can count on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of product that makes you question why you ever paid triple digits for serums that promised the same results (even though some are worth it). However, The Ordinary proves that a simple, effective and refreshingly no-nonsense formula can earn cult status by keeping it simple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real magic of this serum lies in its ingredient lineup and how hard it works behind the scenes. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-niacinamide-serums-per-dermatologists/"&gt;Niacinamide&lt;/a&gt;, also known as vitamin B3, is a multitasking favorite that skincare experts swear by. At a 10% concentration, it helps smooth uneven texture, brighten dull skin and strengthen the skin barrier so your face becomes more resilient over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zinc PCA at 1% supports oil control and helps keep congestion in check, making this serum especially appealing if your skin swings between shiny, clogged or unpredictably breakout-prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being powerful, the serum itself feels refreshingly light. It’s water-based, absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave behind that sticky or greasy feeling that can ruin an otherwise good routine. This makes it incredibly easy to layer with other products, whether you’re a minimalist who just wants &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-cleansers-face-washes-for-dry-skin-review/"&gt;cleanser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-pdrn-skincare-products-review/"&gt;serum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-moisturizers-for-dry-skin-face-products/"&gt;moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; or someone who loves a more involved lineup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It works well both morning and night, slipping seamlessly under &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-sunscreen-for-face/"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; during the day and richer creams in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons this serum has become such a staple is its versatility. I use it to help control oil throughout the day, soften the appearance of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-pore-pads-review/"&gt;pores&lt;/a&gt; and support clearer skin over time. It’s equally as great for evening out the skin tone and giving the face a more balanced, healthy look. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting just one concern, it tackles several at once, which makes it feel like a smart, efficient choice rather than an extra step you don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the value, which is honestly hard to overstate. Products with similar concentrations of niacinamide often cost many times more, yet this serum delivers comparable results without asking you to rethink your budget. &lt;/p&gt;

For seasoned skincare lovers, it’s proof that not every effective product has to be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cancer Vaccine Coalition and American Association for Cancer Research convene first-of-its-kind global think tank as immune-activating treatments reach a tipping point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="legendSpanClass"&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="legendSpanClass"&gt;Jan. 27, 2026&lt;/span&gt; /PRNewswire/ -- Cancer vaccine research is entering a new phase as leading scientists join forces to coordinate the next stage of progress in cancer immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific advances in immunotherapy, technology, and immune system targeting have moved therapeutic cancer vaccines from theoretical promise toward clinical reality. The field is now entering a coordination phase aimed at accelerating patient access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, more than 50 of the world's leading cancer vaccine researchers, clinicians, and cross-sector experts are meeting for &lt;i&gt;Transforming Cancer Care: A Global Think Tank to Accelerate Advances in Cancer Immunity&lt;/i&gt;, a first-of-its-kind effort designed to align priorities and advance progress across the field. The two-day think tank is organized by the Cancer Vaccine Coalition (CVC) in partnership with the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and hosted by HSBC Innovation Banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a moment where coordination becomes the catalyst," said Kristen Dahlgren, founder and CEO of the Cancer Vaccine Coalition, a breast cancer survivor, and former NBC &lt;i&gt;TODAY Show&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nightly News&lt;/i&gt; correspondent. "I've seen the promising data from clinical trials. Patients need better therapies to help them beat cancer, and by working together, we can move advances through the system faster. With almost 1 in 2 of us expected to be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime, there's no time to waste."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The think tank brings together leaders from top academic cancer centers, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as policy and regulatory experts to establish shared priorities and actionable strategies to accelerate cancer vaccine development and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Current immunotherapies successfully treat 20% of the deadliest cancers by unleashing the power of cancer-killing T cells," said Elizabeth Jaffee, MD, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and co-chair of the two-day think tank. "Vaccines have the potential to increase the success of these immunotherapies in the other 80% of deadly cancers by creating cancer-killing T cells. The last decade of scientific discoveries has propelled vaccines toward becoming the next generation of successful immunotherapies for cancer treatment and prevention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the think tank, participants are focused on identifying practical solutions to shared challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Defining scientific priorities across cancer vaccine discovery, development, and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Improving efficiency across research and clinical translation pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Integrating emerging technologies such as AI-driven antigen prediction and novel delivery platforms&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Aligning funding strategies, regulatory pathways, and policy frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Establishing models for sustained global collaboration and equitable access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AACR is honored to work with the Cancer Vaccine Coalition and the think tank sponsors to convene the top experts in the field this week," said Margaret Foti, PhD, MD (hc), chief executive officer of AACR. "By bringing together an international group of dedicated, renowned researchers and patient advocates who are able to contribute a wide range of perspectives and scientific knowledge, we hope to foster the next breakthroughs in cancer vaccine research so that people diagnosed with cancer will have the opportunity to live longer and better lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more than 600,000 lives each year, while millions more live with the fear of recurrence. Cancer vaccines represent a potential shift in how cancer is treated, and, ultimately, prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to train the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells, with the goal of durable, long-term immune protection. Clinical trials are currently underway across multiple cancer types, including glioblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and liver cancers, with early studies showing promising signals of immune response and clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such example is Brad Silver, who received a therapeutic cancer vaccine for stage IV glioblastoma in 2003. At the time, he was given just two months to live. Twenty-two years later, Silver is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am not supposed to be here," said Silver, who was treated in an early stage clinical trial of DCVax-L at UCLA. "The world views a stage IV glioblastoma diagnosis as a death sentence, but I'm living proof that a different outcome could be possible thanks to this clinical research. I wish everyone facing cancer could have access to vaccine-based treatments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Think Tank is supported by HSBC Innovation Banking, Northwest Biotherapeutics, Pfizer and Anixa Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Cancer Vaccine Coalition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cancer Vaccine Coalition (CVC) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines to treat cancer and help prevent recurrence. Founded by former NBC &lt;i&gt;TODAY&lt;/i&gt; Show and &lt;i&gt;Nightly News&lt;/i&gt; correspondent Kristen Dahlgren, CVC is guided by survivors and scientists. It is the only nonprofit solely focused on advancing cancer vaccines by convening researchers and cross-sector partners to move the field into its next phase of coordinated clinical progress. CVC helps fund high-impact clinical trials and works to overcome barriers slowing progress, shortening the path from promising science to real-world patient impact.

It can lead to everyday aches, stiffness, and discomfort, too. The good news is that when you fix the habits that contribute to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/changes-that-improve-your-posture-11750706" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;poor posture&lt;/a&gt;, the rest often starts to fall into place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The catch? Some of our most common daily habits are quietly working against us. Luckily, most of them are easy to spot—and even easier to fix. Ahead, health experts break down the everyday behaviors that can lead to poor back posture and how to correct them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to chiropractor Sherry McAllister, DC, tilting your head forward to look at smartphones and laptops is one of the most common habits that contributes to poor posture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The farther forward your head sits from being stacked on your shoulders, the more pressure is translated onto your spine,”  Dr. McAllister says. “It is often why patients complain of tender points in the shoulders and lower neck.” (This is often colloquially referred to as “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-fix-tech-neck-11759295" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt;.”)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, this can alter the neck’s natural curve, shifting more weight onto the shoulders and upper back. To prevent this, position screens higher or at eye view so you’re not straining your neck.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@5ba8e647" data-item-index="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list-sc-item_2-0" class="comp list-sc-item mntl-block mntl-sc-list-item"&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-prolonged-sitting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Prolonged Sitting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another bad habit we’re all guilty of? &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/ways-to-sit-less-move-more-during-the-day-11855245" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sitting for hours&lt;/a&gt; at a time. “Prolonged sitting causes postural muscles to fatigue, resulting in slouching, which does not support the spine’s natural curves,” Dr. McAllister says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. McAllister says our choice of seating could be partly to blame. Ensure that couches or chairs—especially desk chairs—offer proper support so you’re not straining or overworking any back, neck, or shoulder muscles. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Look for chairs with firm cushioning, good lumbar support, and a seat height that allows your feet to rest flat on the floor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@56191b96" data-item-index="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list-sc-item_3-0" class="comp list-sc-item mntl-block mntl-sc-list-item"&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sleeping-on-your-stomach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Sleeping on Your Stomach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Surprise! Your sleep position could be sabotaging your posture during the day. Dr. McAllister says that laying on your stomach will cause your neck to turn one way or the other and could strain your muscles. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The issue, however, is that we don’t have any control on how we sleep, says Melie Purdon, a YogaRenew instructor. “You can start the night perfectly aligned, savasana-style (corpse pose), and still wake up somewhere completely different,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Purdon suggests paying attention to how you move during the day so your body can focus on resting during the night. “When you shift those patterns, posture improves. And very often, sleep quality improves right along with it,” Purdon says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. McAllister notes that pillows positioned too high or too low, as well as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-often-should-you-replace-your-mattress-8678530" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mattress past its prime&lt;/a&gt;, can compromise spinal health. “[The mattress] will have areas that sag and create an undulated surface,” Dr. McAllister says. “That leads to tight muscles, restless sleep, and stress to the curves in the spine.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-tips callout--bordered" data-text="Tip" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. McAllister suggests using pillows for support if you feel your posture is worsening during sleep. She recommends sleeping on your back with a small pillow under both knees to support the spine’s natural curvature—or, for a cozier option, sleeping on your side with your pillow pulled in, a pillow between the knees, and another to hug. “This can be the trick to a very sound and enjoyable sleep,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@4a1f55cc" data-item-index="3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list-sc-item_4-0" class="comp list-sc-item mntl-block mntl-sc-list-item"&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-poor-form-during-exercise"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Poor Form During Exercise &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise is crucial to our health, but improper form can actually do more harm than good. For example, lifting weights without proper breathing or dropping your head during an exercise can lead to tightness, soreness, or even injury.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to checking your form, Purdon suggests stretching properly before you start your exercise routine. Warming up with light, dynamic stretches—such as shoulder rolls, chest openers, and gentle neck movements—can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/stretching-yoga/stretching-exercises" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;loosen tight muscles&lt;/a&gt; and support better form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@37283088" data-item-index="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list-sc-item_5-0" class="comp list-sc-item mntl-block mntl-sc-list-item"&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-wearing-unsupportive-shoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Wearing Unsupportive Shoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you wear on your feet directly impacts your posture, Dr. McAllister says. “For example, high heels shift the pelvis forward, creating an imbalance that requires greater recruitment of other muscles,” she explains. “When you wear a shoe with a flat insert, you are also losing support for the arches of your foot. This transfers the forces of heel strike to the lower back, knees, and hips.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, shoes like this can create lower back pain. To help prevent it, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/choosing-comfortable-shoes-8709788" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;check your footwear&lt;/a&gt; at least once a year and replace pairs that show uneven wear or feel worn out. Look for shoes with arch support, cushioning in the heel, and a stable sole that helps absorb impact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@2fa8cb29" data-item-index="5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But in certain corners of Instagram and TikTok, women are convinced it really starts much earlier. Now, in addition to the 40 weeks your body is actively growing a fetus, you also have to worry about “trimester zero” — the months before you even start trying to conceive.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In this world, the ideal woman can’t get enough organ meat and takes double the daily recommendation of choline to boost her future baby’s IQ.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She orders her own ferritin tests online so she can see if her iron levels are holding strong at 70 ng/mL or dipping below 50 ng/mL.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She has no need for an alarm clock or caffeine, since she wears blue-light blockers after dark and wakes naturally with the sunrise. The air she breathes is filtered and unpolluted by artificial fragrance. Her kitchen is free of plastic and bleach. Physically, she’s the strongest she’s ever been, because she knows that for the next nine months, her body will be running the equivalent of a marathon every day.&lt;/p&gt;

But increasingly, it feels like the goal post has been moved back. On her podcast, &lt;em&gt;Culture Apothecary&lt;/em&gt;, MAHA influencer Alex Clark &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7ru_5EuRN/"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; women thinking about getting pregnant soon stop wearing nail polish, while holistic nutritionists say it’s important &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPmWlMzEglq/?hl=en"&gt;to avoid drinking iced beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Influencers are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS7xY7zDU-I/?hl=en"&gt;chronicling their meditation journeys&lt;/a&gt; to lower cortisol six months before trying to conceive, while others are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4KiB2O-lo/?hl=en"&gt;ordering direct-to-consumer micronutrient labs&lt;/a&gt; and embarking on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlSeiHR1Ee/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=6"&gt;60-day pregnancy-prep detoxes&lt;/a&gt;. While the recommendations are all over the map, the message is clear: What you’re doing now could be putting your future child at a disadvantage — even if you’re not pregnant yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrouh00263b7a6mjy1z4n@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;I heard from a woman who eats liver every week (it tastes gross, but she read that it’s full of B vitamins) and another who got a stool analysis done to assess her gut health. A dietitian who specializes in fertility says women are coming to her for advice on how to optimize their microbiome before passing it on to their babies.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One mother told me she became fixated on her blood sugar and worried that spikes would increase her risk of miscarriage. She started using a glucometer and stopped drinking orange juice and eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrowg00273b7akkvkenmy@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Many of those I spoke to mentioned reading Lily Nichols’s &lt;a href="https://realfoodforfertility.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Food For Fertility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which emphasizes that, even before you’re pregnant, your diet lays “the essential groundwork for your baby’s development.” That’s just one of a raft of recent books full of advice for women thinking about trying to get pregnant.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In her forthcoming book, &lt;a href="https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fertility Formula&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the reproductive endocrinologist Natalie Crawford suggests women lower their exposure to toxins by avoiding travel during rush hour.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ann Shippy’s &lt;a href="https://annshippymd.com/the-preconception-revolution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Preconception Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tells women not to touch receipts or use hair dye. For the toxins that cannot be avoided, she suggests you start taking &lt;a href="https://shop.annshippymd.com/collections/all-products/products/zeo-bind"&gt;her line of detox supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which she says can help remove heavy metals from your system before you pass them on to your baby via breastmilk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrroyn00283b7a1eg26akv@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;It’s true that many couples struggle to get pregnant, and doctors like Crawford argue that the standard medical advice — start trying and see what happens — is failing women. Yet some claims about the importance of trimester zero strain credulity. According to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDV-rfJuyD/"&gt;Alexandra Radway&lt;/a&gt;, who coaches women on how to prepare their bodies for conception, the women who follow her protocol have pregnancies unburdened by the inconveniences of morning sickness, fatigue, or back pain. Shippy, a functional medicine practitioner, tells me that women have been misled to believe that their fertility declines after age 35. With the right supplements and a “super-clean diet” (i.e., no gluten or dairy), she claims women can easily get pregnant well into their 40s and feel great, “because their bodies are so ready.” For women who are truly healthy, IVF is “very rarely” necessary, she says. Listening to them talk, it’s easy to come away thinking that if you struggle to get pregnant or have a difficult pregnancy, it’s your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp0y00293b7ae0bmpdze@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;Of course, your health before conception matters. But the doctors I spoke to said the things that actually make a difference are far more basic. You should take &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/folate-vs-folic-acid-prenatal-vitamins.html"&gt;a prenatal with folic acid&lt;/a&gt; and avoid smoking and drug use. You should also make sure any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes, are under control, and get up to date with vaccines and STI testing. Most of these are things doctors would recommend to everyone, not just women planning to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter what fancy &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mandymooremm/videos/850166884187166/"&gt;prenatal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://thisisneeded.com/products/egg-quality-support?delivery-schedule=monthly&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=18300978467&amp;amp;utm_term=18300978467%7C%7C&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A18300978467%3A%3A&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=&amp;amp;nb_mi=164791643&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=47045685838069&amp;amp;nb_ppi=&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=17415527961&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACtRsSjqqwgcL8T69TLJW8sj10mjH&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdpJVaM8mnjLyhqsgXEzif1eyK7VbyY3Qc5Du1lXFMzsWCp23-DFP9gaAiSnEALw_wcB&amp;amp;variant=47045685838069"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; try to tell you, there’s no magical solution that will stop your eggs and ovaries from aging, says Katherine VanHise, an OB/GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility Beverly Hills. And sure, some women have no problem getting pregnant in their mid-40s — but that probably has more to do with genetics than with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;

Growing a baby inside your body requires a certain level of blind faith. Of course it’s comforting, and human, to fixate on the choices we do have.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also hard to ignore that the rulebook for how to have a healthy pregnancy is expanding at the same time that access to maternal health care is being decimated. The Trump administration has gutted the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, stopped collecting &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/the-pregnancy-dataset-we-cant-afford-to-lose/"&gt;crucial data on pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and slashed funding for Medicaid, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/nyregion/doulas-childbirth-medicaid.html"&gt;many women rely on for prenatal care&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/trump-rfk-jr-tylenol-autism-explained.html"&gt;urging pregnant women to “tough it out” and avoid Tylenol&lt;/a&gt; against the advice of leading medical associations. Dr. Oz recently applauded the fact that, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjessicaknurick/video/7597608143023082782"&gt;facing a severe shortage of OB/GYNs&lt;/a&gt;, Alabama is now using robots to perform ultrasounds on pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp7a002c3b7ajdh7f76a@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5101902/35-of-u-s-counties-dont-have-an-adequate-place-in-which-to-give-birth-report-finds"&gt;prenatal care becomes a luxury,&lt;/a&gt; maternal and infant health is increasingly presented as a matter of personal responsibility, with choices as basic as what to have for breakfast framed as high stakes. The noise only gets louder once you’re actually pregnant. According to Jessie Inchauspé, a.k.a. the Glucose Goddess, pregnant women should think twice before eating that bagel. Her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/9-months-that-count-forever?srsltid=AfmBOoqYtklQeeAYKevQdghQ1wBxaQk8ty-c9nN8lPf6kYCIu48qJMBy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Months That Count Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, warns that overdoing it on sugar and refined grains can put your baby at risk for all sorts of health complications, including diabetes, obesity, ADHD, and autism. (OBs say that while prenatal nutrition is important, your baby’s future health &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTyJ8pCDSPf/"&gt;is impacted by far more&lt;/a&gt; than the number of cookies you eat while pregnant.)&lt;/p&gt;

She did acupuncture, stopped wearing perfume, swapped out her scented soap, and ate as many goji berries as she could stand. While ovulating, she took Mucinex to thin her cervical mucus. “I stopped working out with a trainer, because I’d read that if you worked out too hard, the egg wouldn’t implant.” She got pregnant after a few months of trying. Yet despite eating “the cleanest I’d ever eaten,” she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She knew it was most likely genetic; diabetes runs in her family. Still, she felt guilty and worried her baby was going to have blood-sugar issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrphw002e3b7ab05wlo97@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;“It just feels like there’s this responsibility on mothers that starts even before you’re pregnant, like, if you don’t do all these things perfectly, then you’re being irresponsible with your future child.” Now, when she takes her 2-month-old to the pediatrician and fills out the postpartum-depression assessment, she always pauses on the question: “Have you blamed yourself unnecessarily?” “I think that’s really hard to answer as a mother, when all the messaging is, ‘You need to do this and this,’” she told me on a phone call while she pumped. These days, her feeds are full of advice on everything she should eat while breastfeeding to ensure her baby is getting all the optimal nutrients. “It feels like it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;
