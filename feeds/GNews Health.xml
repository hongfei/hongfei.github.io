My go-to remedy is usually a coffee and cold-water face plunge, followed by a compulsive phone scroll. But today called for something more, so I unpeeled a small, yellow “energy” patch the size of a walnut, popped it on to my upper arm and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patch (£12 for 30) contains – so the packaging says – vitamins B5, B3 and a “microdose” of caffeine. It is made by Kind Patches, which is one brand in an increasingly crowded market of wellness stickers that claim to treat everything from lack of sleep to period pains to pimples. They are coin-sized, and often come in TikTok-friendly shades of sunflower yellow and peachy orange: you may have seen a teenager sporting a star-shaped one on their face to treat spots, or influencers patting blue magnesium ones on their wrists before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These patches are designed to deliver various substances into the bloodstream through the skin – to ward off some of the most common symptoms of everyday life. Feeling tired? Patches. Feeling stressed? Patches. Feeling anxious? Patches. From libido boosters to immunity enhancers, there’s a patch for every condition if you look hard enough. The wearable patch market – which also includes disease monitoring and drug delivery – was estimated at &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ebdee6d-eee0-4ed9-a7e2-7547bd1f03c9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$9.95bn in 2024&lt;/a&gt; (approx £7.45bn) and is predicted to grow significantly in the next five years, according to the Financial Times. Forget eating your feelings; pop a sticker on them instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="89c65e0d-f726-4cb8-ad45-cf40b21e432f" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Star patches for acne and pimples are the accessory of choice for gen Z.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But do they work? Or are they yet more snake oil in the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/global-wellness-industry-is-now-worth-6-3-trillion" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$6tn global wellness industry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;designed to exploit our weaknesses, on the basis that those most human of conditions – how well you sleep, how happy you are – are there to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Tregoning, professor of vaccine immunology at Imperial College London and author of the book &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/live-forever-9780861549382/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Live Forever?&lt;/a&gt;, says it is impossible to know. “It’s not like a vaccine where you did or didn’t get the virus. It is: do you feel better?” For example, the energy patch I’m wearing now may make me feel better. “But my take on energy might be different to yours,” Tregoning points out. If nothing else, he says, patches like the ones I am sampling “are an example of drifting placebo. Simply by putting it on, it might get you out of a slump”. It’s also nigh-on impossible to prove which ones don’t work if you can’t prove which ones do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You cannot feel these patches , and they slide off easily in the bath. But you can certainly see them, which for some users is half the point. Depending on where you place the patch – guidance varies, but most suggest the neck and chest areas to see which makes a difference – they are often as visible as you need them to be. Some claim to work the same day, while others suggest using them for up to a month. The effects of the energy patch I am wearing are supposed to be instant. I can’t say I feel anything that morning, but by the time I peel it off in the bath, I do believe I feel fresher. The idea is neat. But is it the patch? I also did some yoga, and had steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I try another energy patch by The What Supp Co (£18 for 15 patches), which it says is for “fatigue, fed-up feelings and focus”. It contains ashwagandha (which it &lt;a href="https://thewhatsupp.com/products/protect-your-energy-vitamin-patches" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; “helps your body adapt to stress”) and caffeine among a list of other ingredients. I pop the red W-shaped patch on my wrist, as shown in the instruction video. I don’t know if it is doing anything, but I do struggle to get to sleep that night, which is debatably down to the caffeine (luckily I have a patch for sleep too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Acupuncturist Ross J Barr also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/focus-patches?variant=55856746627452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; that promises to support “focus, clarity and mental performance” (£15 for 10). Less visible than most, it smells herbal, a little festive, which is the point – it apparently offers a “deeply relaxing olfactive experience”&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;I could also feel it when I put the patch on – a gentle tingling, not unlike a Tens machine, which did at least make me believe it was doing something. I also try Barr’s &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/period-patches?variant=44601291374756" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Period Patches&lt;/a&gt; for cramps, aches and pains (£15 for seven), which were developed with gynaecological staff at Miss Claire Mellon &amp;amp; Associates private practice. Like Barr’s other patch, it smells strongly of essential oils – somewhere between a meadow and tobacco – which is also the point. The sticker is stickier, and even after six hours it’s hard to remove. It is also designed to fit very specifically at the base of the spine. I don’t know how much this played into what happened next – but something did. My cramps seemed to mellow. Whether this was better than taking a painkiller, I couldn’t say. But the patches certainly cost more than over-the-counter painkillers – a factor that Dr Deborah Cohen, author of the new book Bad Influence: How the Internet Hijacked Our Health, thinks might influence how well they work. “The more expensive something is, the more you expect it to work,” she says. Cohen thinks women’s health has been neglected for too long, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;these patches expose broader problems in the healthcare system too. “One of the reasons we go to social media to solve our problems is because doctors can’t give that level of holistic care,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="60e35233-9643-491c-b91b-78c873e8cea5" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ross J Barr Focus Patches.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ross J Barr&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eleven days into my patch journey, I have tried one for sleep and one for dreaming (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for 10, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kind, £12 for 30); two for focus (Kind, £12 for 30, and Ross J Barr, £15 for 10), one for energy (Kind, £12 for 30), one for chilling out (The What Supp Co, £18 for 15), and another for menstrual cramps (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for seven). I’d love to say their collective effect was seismic, but aside from feeling a little buzzy after wearing those containing caffeine and the aforementioned effects of Barr’s cramp patches, I can’t be sure that I felt &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s not to say they didn’t work. The science behind patches is at best nebulous and at worse absent, but as you can’t control the variables, it’s impossible to know if it’s the patch – or something else. “Reducing something to, say, one hormone is a very reductionist way of looking at our health,” says Cohen. “We need to be more holistic and look at the whole person before we work out how to treat something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inevitably some of these patches have taken a more sinister turn towards diet culture. Berberine, a plant-derived compound, is believed to suppress appetite. I try Kind’s berberine patches (which curiously changed their name from Weightless); they need to be worn every day to see a difference. When I go out for a walk, I have to turn back as I start feeling light-headed. I quickly take it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m struck that only one of the patches I try comes with the caveat that they are not the only solution to a problem. Alongside using Barr’s sleep patches, for example, it is recommended that other basic sleep hygiene practices are brought in – read a book, turn off your phone, etc. While there may not be anything specifically wrong with putting on a patch if you can afford it, they are not a panacea. As Tregoning points out, it’s probably best to see them “like an expensive herbal tea”. Drink it if you like it and think it helps, but it’s not a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But then this is the problem with a lot of the products in the wellness space – everyone is looking for a hack, a quick fix. It is easier to put a sleep patch on than contemplate that poor sleep may be a logical response to the modern world; that a lack of energy may be due to an overwhelming life; that a lack of focus may mean you are dealing with bigger problems than the day-to-day of going to work. In an age in which we have learned to manipulate the aesthetics of our bodies through surgery or fillers, it seems highly appropriate that we might also now wear our supplements. As Cohen writes in her book, “the body is now a dashboard to be monitored and gamified”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec98b8d3-2cd1-4d0d-8d35-87523ca15e67" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And of course, this is performative health. When I failed to give up smoking, my nicotine patch was proof to the outside world that I was at least trying. Lisa Payne, head of beauty at trend forecaster company Stylus, calls it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“handbag health” – the idea that you can carry around patches and pop them on when you need a lift. “These patches cost money, so it literally shows you have invested in your health.” Forget eating your feelings; pop a plaster on them instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The use of patches in medicine is nothing new, says Pupinder Ghatora, a pharmacist and co-founder of a collagen supplement brand. “In pharmaceuticals, we’ve used patches for pain relief, anti-sickness medications, certain heart treatments and nicotine-replacement therapy. These medicines are clinically proven as the molecule is suitable for skin absorption and the formulation is designed with this in mind.” However, the evidence on wellness patches for other purposes is less clear. “Transdermal delivery can absolutely be effective but only when the science supports it. The skin barrier is incredibly sophisticated and not every ingredient can pass through it,” Ghatora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The problem, adds Cohen, isn’t just the way these substances are delivered – it’s the substances themselves. “Before you get to the ‘route’, the first thing to ask is whether the compound they’re promoting is going to do anything.” Take something like dopamine, she says, for which patches do exist. This needs to go into your brain to work. How does that even happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HRT patches and nicotine patches [which have been around for a while] require robust clinical trials to prove they have an effect. But if you can spin something into a wellness supplement, you don’t need regulators,” she says. “Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Perhaps the most ubiquitous patches are Star patches. If you have a teenager – or watched last year’s Big Brother – there is every chance you’ve come across them. Designed to protect spots from bacteria and prevent picking, while also containing various ingredients which may or may not treat the spot, they have become such a mainstay of modern culture that the V&amp;amp;A recently acquired some in its &lt;a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/rapid-response-collecting?srsltid=AfmBOoqFisrHBGVBj0Q5Zwa6ZkuqzU81v9_Y_vLnMhq1-Dt0TWJ0UKHl" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rapid Response Collecting&lt;/a&gt; as an example of gen Z lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b04ec8d4-65f9-4d3f-aef7-ea12d840ae31" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kind’s Berberine metabolic balance patch.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Kind Patches&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advertising that you have a pimple is a million miles away from how millennials like me and Payne grew up. “Our generation saw beauty as something that solves the problem you want to fix,” she says. If you had a spot, you’d buy concealer to hide it, not a neon sticker to broadcast it as a shared experience. But for some of gen Z, Payne says, a visible treatment for an internal feeling is as much about identity as anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It used to be easy to be good. All you had to do was combine a decent diet, exercise, time outside and connection with friends. Now, says Cohen, “daily life is subjected to medical interpretation and diagnosis, with normal variations reframed as conditions requiring intervention”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I spent three weeks patched up, on and off. And some people I know swear by Barr’s sleep patches. But it was also deep, dark December, a time when my moods and sleep shift like sand, and as a newish millennial parent, it was ever thus. Patches are an example of the way influencer culture has scrambled how we look at ourselves. But if you’re tired and there’s no other underlying problem causing it, the likelihood is you probably need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQZ0QzX0RELUZCc2lrOW8zMVp6R0k2S1NJRG1uaVJnbVUtanQ4X1pPdWp1TWFCOUZ3clJOUTRSbE55RzNxUFFMRERQOWZQb1FPSHRac3F0SzNpTzNLZkZSLUpRbHpKV2xPdDJ1ZnNEaDVZa0FmaTRHMGdDUmc2ZzRwajZydWllaHdfOFV5RkpmRHdQcXlVNG5SX1g5aTVkd3pDMXhQUklZWkU3aWY3NGZBRlpLaVlJM2l5X2NmQm9YdVo</guid></item><item><title>医生说， “每天只需几分钟”就可以改善平衡并降低跌倒的风险- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/a-doctor-says-all-it-takes-is-a-few-intentional-minutes-a-day-to-improve-balance-and-reduce-your-risk-of-falls</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;p id="c7c34f02-07d5-4e2f-b4fc-42f0d007c3b0"&gt;Improving balance is one of the biggest concerns for many of my older personal training clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During recent icy weather, one of my senior clients came to her session wearing a pair of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FYaktrax-Traction-Cleats-Walking-Medium%2Fdp%2FB0094GO9DA%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1178288354270693491-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Yaktrax-Traction-Cleats-Walking-Medium/dp/B0094GO9DA/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FYaktrax-Traction-Cleats-Walking-Medium%2Fdp%2FB0094GO9DA%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;YakTrax&lt;/a&gt;—ice grips that fit over your regular shoes, like snow chains you put around car tyres in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="c7c34f02-07d5-4e2f-b4fc-42f0d007c3b0-2"&gt;They’re worries are understandable. “Falls are one of the leading causes of injury worldwide, especially as we age,” internal medicine physician &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/seizethedaywithdrday/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/seizethedaywithdrday/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Dr Cristina Sciavolino-Day&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “They can lead to fractures, hospitalizations, loss of independence and fear of movement afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s important to emphasize is that many falls are preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a physician, I always remind my patients that balance is not something we either have or don’t have—it’s a skill, just like strength, and it can be trained at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest mistake people make is thinking balance training has to be time-consuming or intimidating.

			&lt;p&gt;Reduced blood flow to the brain is thought to be a key factor in many forms of dementia, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="187972" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, and scientists have just identified a new mechanism regulating this flow, which may also help explain how it goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fat molecule helps maintain the system's balance, researchers at the University of Vermont discovered, and in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, disruption of this balance led to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing the imbalance restored more normal blood flow, offering a hopeful new target for understanding and treating dementia-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery is a huge step forward in our efforts to prevent dementia and neurovascular diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/medcommunications/news/r1-larner-spotlight-new-evidence-larner-researchers-points"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Osama Harraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;An Early Warning Sign of Dementia Risk May Be Keeping You Up at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ctm.2020.01.005"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"&gt;endothelial cells&lt;/a&gt;, which line the inside of blood vessels, the team looked specifically at the protein Piezo1 – a pressure 'sensor' in the cells. When this sensor is overactivated, it can disrupt the brain's blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing brain activity in mice, they determined that a fat molecule called PIP2 acts as a brake on Piezo1. When &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neurons-in-the-brain-appear-to-follow-a-distinct-mathematical-pattern"&gt;brain cells are active&lt;/a&gt;, PIP2 levels are low, and Piezo1 is activated, increasing blood flow to where it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187975" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187975" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis.jpg" alt="Brain analysis" class="wp-image-187975 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187975" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researcher Osama Harraz at work analyzing brain vasculature.

This led to Piezo1 overactivating, boosting blood flow to areas where it wasn't required and disrupting overall circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, when the researchers restored PIP2 levels in these mice, normal blood flow patterns were largely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days in understanding exactly how this mechanism works – this was a short-term study that only looked at mice – but it's another promising area to explore when it comes to investigating the underlying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;drivers of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-may-be-tied-to-vascular-dementia-cases-review-finds"&gt;Vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, in which impaired blood flow to the brain is a key contributor, is one of the most common forms of dementia, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930251404243"&gt;affecting millions&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Blood flow problems are also thought to play a role in Alzheimer's disease, although the damaging buildup of toxic proteins is likely more significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As blood flow controls the delivery of oxygen and nutrients &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-high-fat-meal-can-disrupt-blood-flow-to-your-brain-study-finds"&gt;to the brain&lt;/a&gt;, the implications extend beyond dementia. Maintaining the right balance is essential for keeping the brain functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish the foundation for a therapeutic approach for improving cerebral blood flow in conditions where Piezo1 activity is altered and could have impacts beyond brain blood flow control," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522750122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our understanding of dementia is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;steadily improving&lt;/a&gt;, there's still a lot we don't know about how these diseases begin or why some people are more vulnerable than others. Even with vascular dementia, it's not clear what all of the contributing factors to blood flow might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies like this help fill in those gaps by identifying the molecular players involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers plan to look at precisely how PIP2 interacts with Piezo1. Understanding that interaction will be crucial for controlling this system and potentially restoring healthy blood flow – and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-drug-reverses-mental-decline-in-mice-with-advanced-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are uncovering the complex mechanisms of these devastating conditions, and now we can begin to think about how to translate this biology into therapies," &lt;a href="https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/medcommunications/news/r1-larner-spotlight-new-evidence-larner-researchers-points"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Harraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522750122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They also have a higher risk of a late-stage diagnosis compared with their white counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prostate Cancer UK highlighted the apparent “postcode lottery” with regard to testing and diagnoses of the disease. It found that rates of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing were highest in the south-east of England and lowest in the north-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Men living in areas of higher deprivation were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer that had spread than those living in more affluent areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chiara De Biase, the director of health services, equity and improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said risk awareness campaigns had played a big part in the overall increase, which had led to “more men than ever being diagnosed and treated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in the UK, but despite this, men are facing deeply unfair inequities across the country, and their experiences vary hugely based on where they live,” De Biase said. “We urgently need an early detection programme that will address these regional inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"NHS expands access to prostate cancer drug in England to save thousands of lives","elementId":"470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/16/prostate-cancer-drug-abiraterone-nhs-england"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “Mass risk-awareness campaigns have played a big part in causing this increase, such as how in February 2022, we launched a national campaign with the NHS to reach men across the UK to get them to check their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when celebrities like Bill Turnbull, Nick Owen and Colin McFarlane share their prostate cancer stories, men can be encouraged to ask about a test themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, prostate cancer became &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/28/prostate-cancer-becomes-most-common-cancer-diagnosis-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the most common cancer in England&lt;/a&gt;, but new figures from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enabled the UK-wide analysis. In Scotland there were 5,608 prostate cancer diagnoses, an increase of 30% compared with previous figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ian Walker, the executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said that the figures could be affected by overdiagnosis of the disease, “where PSA tests in asymptomatic men could be spotting cancers that wouldn’t cause any harm”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A panel of expert government health advisers in November said prostate cancer screening &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/28/prostate-cancer-screening-not-expected-to-be-made-widely-available-in-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;should not be made available&lt;/a&gt; to the vast majority of men across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee instead recommended that there should be a targeted screening programme for men with a confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 faulty gene variant, which means they are more at risk of faster growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age. Men in that category could be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is despite campaigners and charities calling for men at higher risk of developing the disease, such as black men and those with a family history of the cancer, to have screening available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are determined to improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer, and we know that too many men in deprived communities are being diagnosed at a later stage when the disease is harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Last week the NHS expanded access to abiraterone – a treatment that can significantly improve survival rates and give patients precious extra years of life and we are also making progress on cutting cancer waiting times – in the last 12 months, 213,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOUkM3bWR3RXlmMTd4aWtFYUw5NXFpT094NHVINXpDN0ZEZGp4MnJXREI3VXZCU2lYcWVoTFkyQ2tKMVZEX2F4WWVtRV9vbzE4WGh3aElZMTFVYlBzc3BhOXBpOFlYZGs1VlA1M1Q0YXVsbHdPX3JtMV9GTzJfNm51OTBtVXpmTXFhYTFvbm1WV0ZpN0NGSjhrLUt6SGE0RmgwYmFTUlh2Z29kcFhjYmttS2h4T0NXZllSTzA4</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现人体炎症的天然“关闭开关” - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-the-bodys-natural-off-switch-for-inflammation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:49:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPbXF6SGJnc3BtT0tXWGRxdS1FNWp1Z0lDXzRYbU5ZdmRBOWpMaFN5MWp6ME9nSmZmQWpZclg5Q2xPUE13SDQ1OUR4eHpnVkJZeUE2WXlJdHduNXlvR3UtWXZxbzBJdlViMzNWZ2VsUFRyTVZpTjdWTE1oSnhWNzZGWFJnMHQxOXJUM0hPSlpiN0NMem0tUGc</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic和其他GLP-1激动剂怀疑论者指南-怀疑论者</title><link>https://www.skeptic.com/article/skeptics-guide-ozempic-glp1-agonists/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="skp_content" class="gh-content gh-canvas skeptic_load_content"&gt;

&lt;p class="note"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A new compass for the SKEPDOC column&lt;/strong&gt;. This column was founded by Harriet Hall, MD (1945–2023) who wrote it from 2006 to 2023. In 2026, we welcome William Meller, MD, to the helm. As an expert in evolutionary medicine, Dr. Meller will be our guide in navigating the deep biological history of our species to find the “True North” of human health. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="dropCap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; have been practicing medicine for more than 40 years. During that time the management of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM)—the kind that usually is caused by being overweight—often felt like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down, often heavier than before. We faced a “diabesity” epidemic where the available tools were blunt instruments at best. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle interventions—meaning trying to get someone to change their behavior—was the most and least effective method we had. Most, because in the less than two percent of patients who were successful, it works very well. Least, because, well … 98 percent failed. And they failed because all of our evolutionary history (“See food? Eat it!”) was working against them. This is the mismatch theory: a mismatch between the environment of our evolutionary ancestry that designed our brains to seek foods that were at once rare and nutritious (sweets and fats) and the modern environment in which such foods are in such overabundance that we eat far beyond the saturation point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmacological options were often disappointing: Sulfonylureas and insulin lower blood sugar but caused weight gain, exacerbating the underlying problem. Bariatric surgery works, but it is invasive and carries surgical as well as lifelong nutritional risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;When we look at the data for GLP receptor agonists, along with the innumerable before and after photos of successful weight loss transformations, we are forced to admit that we have moved from a realm of wishful thinking into one of potent pharmacology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into this therapeutic desert crawled the Gila Monster (above), a venomous lizard native to the American Southwest from which researchers derived GLP receptor agonists (Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists)—medications that mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone that lead to lower blood sugar, help control appetite, and promote weight loss by telling the pancreas to release more insulin when glucose is high, slowing the rate of stomach emptying, and signaling to the brain a sense of fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a skeptic, I am allergic to the word “miracle,” but when we look at the data for GLP receptor agonists, along with the innumerable before and after photos of successful weight loss transformations, we are forced to admit that we have moved from a realm of wishful thinking into one of potent pharmacology. But, as always in medicine, there is no free lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-incretin-concept-from-gut-to-glory"&gt;The Incretin Concept: From Gut to Glory &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins with the “incretin effect”—the observation that glucose taken by mouth triggers a much stronger insulin response by increasing the production of hormones in the pancreas, compared to when it is injected directly into a vein. The gut knows you are eating and tells the pancreas to get ready to pack away the extra calories as fat. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, this effect is blunted and the sugar floats around in the bloodstream much longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists identified two main hormones responsible: Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-like Peptide (GLP-1). The problem is that GIP doesn’t work well in diabetics. GLP-1 works beautifully—stimulating insulin, suppressing glucagon, and slowing gastric emptying—but it has a fatal flaw: It is destroyed by the enzyme DPP-4 within minutes of entering the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to two distinct pharmaceutical strategies. The earlier version was DPP-4 Inhibitors. Drugs like the “Gliptins” block DPP-4, making GLP-1 last longer. They are well-tolerated but their ability to lower blood sugar is modest and they generally do not cause weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer strategy was to engineer versions of GLP to resist degradation. This is where the Gila monster strolled in. In the 1990s, while researching hormone-like drugs, Dr. John Eng noted a similarity between &lt;em&gt;exendin-4&lt;/em&gt; found in Gila venom to Glucagon-like peptide (GLP), and it was able to resist breakdown by DPP! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-evidence-efficacy-beyond-the-hype"&gt;The Evidence: Efficacy Beyond the Hype &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first GLP-1 agonist, exenatide (Byetta, approved in 2005), required twice-daily injections and produced modest weight loss. But the pharmacology evolved rapidly. We moved to once-daily liraglutide, and then to the once-weekly heavyweights: dulaglutide, semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), and the dual GIP and GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trials, called LEAD, SUSTAIN, PIONEER, STEP, and SURPASS (you’ve got to just love the creative acronyms!) have generated data that are hard to dismiss: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycemic Control&lt;/strong&gt;: These drugs consistently outperform most oral antidiabetics in lowering blood sugar by 10 to 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the game changer. While early drugs produced 2–4 kg of weight loss over six months, the newer agents are producing results previously only seen with surgery. In the STEP-1 trial, semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in an approximately 15 percent body weight reduction. Tirzepatide pushed this further, achieving up to 22 percent weight loss in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. That is the effect of a 250-pound person losing 55 pounds! Who wouldn’t want some of that?! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps most importantly, these drugs are not like some that just make numbers look better; they are saving lives. Liraglutide and semaglutide have demonstrated significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including heart attack and stroke, in high-risk populations. The SELECT trial recently showed semaglutide reduces MACE by 20 percent even in nondiabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. But don’t be fooled, it is not likely that these drugs have specific effects on the heart. It is probable that the fat loss alone is causing these benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-skeptical-scrutiny-the-risks"&gt;Some Skeptical Scrutiny: The Risks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a drug sounds too good to be true, we must look for the catch. GLP-1 agonists have plenty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Puke” Diet?&lt;/strong&gt; The most common side effects of GLP-1 agonists are gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. In some trials, up to 45 percent of patients experienced nausea. While this usually subsides, it raises a valid question: Are people losing weight because their metabolism is optimized, or because they feel too sick to eat? The mechanism involves central appetite suppression in the hypothalamus, but the “gastric braking” effect is real and unpleasant for many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pancreas and Thyroid Scare&lt;/strong&gt;. Early observational data suggested a link between GLP-1 agonists and pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. However, extensive reviews have not confirmed a causal link to pancreatic cancer, though a slight increase in pancreatitis persists in some data. This makes sense, as one of the major sites of GLP’s effects is on the pancreas. In the thyroid, these drugs cause C-cell tumors in rodents. Humans have far fewer GLP-1 receptors on their thyroid C-cells than rats, and so far no evidence of increased thyroid cancer has been confirmed in humans. Still, the Black Box warning remains: If you have a family history of endocrine tumors or medullary thyroid cancer, these drugs are not for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;If we are simply shrinking patients without preserving their strength, we may be trading one set of problems for another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanishing Muscle&lt;/strong&gt;. Weight loss via GLP-1 agonists is not just fat loss, so overall body composition must be monitored. In the STEP-1 trial, DEXA scans showed that lean body mass (muscle and bone) accounted for nearly 40 percent of the weight lost. In older adults, this raises the specter of “sarcopenic obesity”—being frail and weak despite having excess fat. Losing muscle mass compromises physical function and metabolic health. If we are simply shrinking patients without preserving their strength, we may be trading one set of problems for another. Now, regular and increased exercise is part of the prescription for all patients taking GLP drugs, but studies on how well this works are still in progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Perioperative Peril&lt;/strong&gt;. Because GLP-1 agonists delay gastric emptying, there have been reports of patients aspirating (inhaling) gastric contents during anesthesia, even after standard fasting protocols. This is a new, practical safety concern that surgical societies are rushing to address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;. Reports of suicidal ideation appeared in postmarketing monitoring of GLP-1 agonist users, prompting investigations by European regulators. However, recent large cohort studies have not supported an increased risk of suicidality compared to other diabetes medications. As with all centrally acting drugs, vigilance is required, but the current data are reassuring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Lifetime Prescription?&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant caveat for GLP-1 agonists is durability. Obesity can be a chronic, relapsing disease. Trials show that when patients stop taking semaglutide, they regain two-thirds of the lost weight within a year, and cardiometabolic improvements revert toward baseline. This implies that these are not “cures” but lifelong therapies, much like blood pressure medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;. As I write this, these drugs are prohibitively expensive, creating a massive public health gap. We also saw shortages that left diabetic patients unable to fill prescriptions because the supply was diverted to off-label weight loss use. GLP-1 agonists are not expensive to produce, however, and the patent on Ozempic expired in January of 2026 in Canada and China (and lasts until 2030 in the U.S.), but I expect the market to bring the costs down dramatically over the next few years. As of this year, close to 12 percent of Americans have tried it at least once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="needles-versus-pills"&gt;Needles Versus Pills &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that holds patients back from the current crop of injectable incretins it is the needle. Despite the efficacy of weekly injections, people prefer pills. The pharmaceutical industry, never one to leave money on the table, has been racing to develop an oral alternative that doesn’t require the strict fasting rituals of earlier attempts like oral semaglutide. Enter &lt;em&gt;orforglipron&lt;/em&gt;, the latest contender in the “nonpeptide small molecule” class, which promises the benefits of GLPs without the injection or the fuss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike existing peptide predecessors that are digested by stomach acid unless armored with absorption enhancers, orforglipron is a chemical—a small molecule designed to survive the GI tract and activate the GLP-1 receptor directly. The data from the ATTAIN-1 trial, published in September 2025, look good. Patients on the 36 mg dose achieved an average weight loss of 11.2 percent over 72 weeks, compared to just 2.1 percent for placebo. No needles. And this pill does not require the “empty stomach, no water, wait 30 minutes” song-and-dance required by oral semaglutide; it can be taken with or without food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;These are serious medications with serious side effects, and they may require lifelong commitment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, let’s look a little past the convenience. While an 11.2 percent average weight loss is clinically significant, it trails behind the 13.7 percent average reduction seen with semaglutide and 20.2 percent with tirzepatide. Furthermore, the biology of GLP-1 agonism remains the same regardless of delivery method: You cannot cheat physiology. In the ATTAIN-1 trial, adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in up to 10.3 percent of patients on the drug, compared to only 2.7 percent on placebo. The side effects are the usual suspects—gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and constipation—confirming that oral delivery does not bypass the “gastric braking” misery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must also remain vigilant regarding safety. The development of a similar small molecule, lotiglipron, was unceremoniously halted due to liver toxicity concerns. While orforglipron has passed its Phase 3 hurdles without these specific signals so far, the history of pharmacology teaches us that rare, serious adverse events often lurk in the postmarketing shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while proponents argue that small molecules are cheaper to manufacture than biologics, whether those savings will be passed on to the patient or simply absorbed into the profit margins remains to be seen, with projected self-pay costs in some cases exceeding $1,000 per month. Orforglipron represents a technological leap, but it is not a magic wand; it is simply a more convenient way to induce the same physiological trade-offs we have seen over the last several years with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the incretin era, our ability to manage the twin epidemics of diabetes and obesity was dishearteningly limited. GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a hard-earned pharmacological breakthrough, offering potent glucose control and unprecedented weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, skepticism is still warranted regarding their indiscriminate use. They are already being used in numerous off-label ways, like shedding a few pounds before a wedding, allegedly decreasing cravings for addictive drugs like alcohol and narcotics, and purportedly even for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. There are ongoing studies for these uses, but early data are weak and the risks are unknown. These are serious medications with serious side effects, and they may require lifelong commitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Skeptic</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:21:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5OYlMxMzI4NzRVZm43eDJ5c0lSSWtyZ3h2SWprNDhxaWlqWU1CclZJUy0tb25fRmFWY01ZYnZicFZNWmhuRkxwZzlRT3AycUZPTmo2bjV6c1JmMF8zdWEwM0YtWmdpc2g4T0JsR1hpMjZlYkxWVjhIbA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，减肥手术在收入水平上胜过GLP-1s治疗2型糖尿病- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/19/diabetes-study-bariatric-surgery-better-than-glp-1s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When endocrinologist Mary Elizabeth Patti looks at a patient with type 2 diabetes who could benefit from weight loss, she sees more than body mass index and blood glucose levels. She also recognizes the challenges of social vulnerability, understanding how low income, food insecurity, and limited access to health care might matter in treatment choice. After all, those factors are strongly linked to developing type 2 diabetes and obesity in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more than a dozen years, Patti has been a leader of long-running randomized clinical trials conducted in four U.S. cities that compared bariatric surgery to medication and lifestyle management for type 2 diabetes. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2815401" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In 2024&lt;/a&gt;, one of those trials demonstrated the superiority of bariatric surgery for patients, measured by lower blood glucose levels, higher weight loss (28% vs. 10%), less use of diabetes medications, remission of diabetes to the point of no longer needing to inject insulin, and reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new secondary analysis of the larger trial &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01882" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Patti and her colleagues asked how different social determinants of health affected outcomes after bariatric surgery compared to medical therapy for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery was better than medical therapy across all social backgrounds, they found, and not just in areas of higher deprivation. The ancillary study was smaller, and some of the participants randomized in earlier stages crossed over from medical to surgical treatment, and the reverse. The authors acknowledged and accounted for these limitations, along with the rapid development of more powerful obesity drugs not fully captured in the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “Bariatric surgery remains an underutilized approach. Even in comparison to these really wonderful medications that we now have access to, it is still better,” Patti, an endocrinologist and director of the hypoglycemia clinic at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, told STAT. “I’m not a surgeon, but I think we need to keep in mind that surgery offers an approach which can be a durable therapy for type 2 diabetes and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;At the overall study’s start, carried out in Boston, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Seattle, 355 participants were randomly assigned to undergo medical therapy or one of three surgical approaches: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric lap banding. Medical and lifestyle interventions, based on the well-known Diabetes Prevention Program, included individualized nutrition counseling and instruction on exercise and how to monitor glucose. As time passed, fewer people chose lap band surgery, which has now fallen out of favor, and newer obesity drugs were increasingly available in the trials’ later stages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people from the medication group later chose surgery, and some people who’d had surgery began taking obesity drugs. By year 12, more than a third of participants in the medical therapy groups and more than a quarter in the surgical groups were receiving incretin-based therapy, the class of drugs that includes older ones like liraglutide (sold as Saxenda) as well as newer GLP-1s like tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The smaller study analyzed data from 258 adults with type 2 diabetes who began the larger trial having either undergone bariatric surgery or received medical and lifestyle therapy. They had been sorted by their ZIP codes to identify the Area Deprivation Index for where they lived. Their weight and hemoglobin A1c levels, which measure blood glucose, were tracked for seven&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there was a trend toward better outcomes from surgery for people living in a high deprivation area, it was not statistically significant, Patti said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navigating diabetes care alone is hard, she said, particularly when combined with socioeconomic challenges. Patients are asked to modify their diets, perhaps in ways tough on family food budgets. Exercise is important, but not always feasible for people working two jobs to make ends meet. Then there’s the medical environment, where it’s difficult even for insured people to maintain access to medications and keep taking them consistently.  “If you don’t have an advocate in the health care system and you really don’t have a way to keep up with the need for approvals or prior authorizations, being an advocate for yourself — that’s really hard when you are having many social, financial and other stressors,” Patti said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the enthusiasm for all things GLP-1, surgery may not be top of mind for these patients, whatever their socioeconomic circumstances. Neither approach is easy. One dividing line: If someone hopes to lose 100 pounds, that’s more likely with surgery than with medications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s so many more options now for people, which is great. And people might end up needing more than one modality,” Melanie Jay,  a professor of medicine and population health at New York University who is also director of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Program on Obesity Research, said in an interview. She was not involved in the study. “Obesity is a disease that often needs to be managed lifelong. We don’t have a cure yet, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biology behind the success of surgery or medical therapy is remarkably similar, something that may be lost in the rush to develop pills to replace injectable medications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgery reduces appetite, too, changing the way nutrients interact with the intestine and resulting in increased secretion of — you guessed it — GLP-1 hormones after a meal. These hormones plus weight loss improve diabetes control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’re not stopping medications because of side effects or because your insurance company is not paying for it anymore,” Patti said. “So it’s a sustained way to activate the same intestinally derived mechanisms that intersect with the brain to change appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Samuels, a professor of surgery at Vanderbilt, argues that all therapies for obesity remain underused. Bariatric surgery, despite its track record for safety, effectiveness, and long-term durability, reaches a very small percentage of patients who qualify, he said, and medications don’t help all the people who could benefit. He was not involved in the study, which he called an important evaluation, even if outpaced by newer drugs. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, next-generation incretin-based agents may narrow the gap for some patients, but real-world durability, tolerability, adherence, and — critically — affordability and access will determine how closely medications can match surgical outcomes across diverse populations,” he said via email about obesity drugs. “Ultimately, we need large, long-term, well-designed studies to clarify the best strategy for a given patient.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patti wants surgery to still be in the discussion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can look at epidemiology and large population studies, and they all show that bariatric surgery is more effective at improving diabetes control, improving diabetes remission, reducing complications, and prolonging survival,” she said. “But you know, when we’re talking to an individual patient, the question is, what’s the best choice for that particular patient?”&lt;/p&gt;

He was riding his dirt bike — he’s been riding since he was three years old — when he was involved in a crash with a truck half a mile from his home in Rigby. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was most likely killed on impact,” Janice Bell, who is Freeman’s aunt, told EastIdahoNews.com. “He had a helmet and all his riding gear on, and it didn’t save him.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 13, just days before the accident, Freeman turned 21. Bell said her nephew’s best friend, who is in his late 60s, told him he needed to get a “big boy license” since he was now 21. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He took Friday off to go get his new drivers license … and he thought to himself (and told his mom), ‘I’m an adult now, I should be a donor.’ He wasn’t a donor before,” Bell explained. “When he went down there (to renew his license), he became a donor. That was Friday, and he was killed Sunday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the accident, Freeman was rushed to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where his family was told he wouldn’t survive. The hospital found out he was a donor, and he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit and put on life support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A donor honor walk took place Oct. 22, where Freeman, who had been declared brain dead, was wheeled down to the operating room as family, friends, coworkers and hospital employees lined the hallways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Freeman’s decision to become a donor, he helped save the lives of seven other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His heart went to another 21-year-old boy in Utah,” Bell, who said she hopes that person goes on to “do great things,” explained. “We don’t know much about his other ones (like) his kidneys and lungs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg" alt="Titus Freeman in hospital." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-804998" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-860x478.jpeg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-600x333.jpeg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Freeman not only helped others as a donor but also by giving freely and serving those around him, which he did throughout his life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman worked for Knife River in Idaho Falls at the time of his death. Bell mentioned that he led a crew of men twice his age, and he’d get to work at 5 a.m. to start everybody’s machines so they’d be warm for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He gave his whole crew lunch money (and gas money) all the time,” she said. “When he passed away, they all paid him back in his front loader (that) was his machine. It was full of money.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman, who was born in Caldwell, has one older and one younger sister. Bell said Freeman had a challenging childhood, but he rose above it. At 19, he decided to buy a house in Rigby for his mom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She not only loved him — every parent has a favorite, I don’t care what they say. If they say they don’t, they lie — but Titus, the reason he was her favorite is he also loved her the most,” Bell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman was a gifted baseball player who enjoyed playing disc golf and going fishing. When he was 12, he rebuilt a snowmobile, and most recently, he was rebuilding the engine in his truck. He got his truck running the day of his accident, but he never got a chance to drive it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was such a good boy. Never in trouble in his life,” Bell recalled. “He didn’t go out drinking. He was in bed by 8 or 9. We call him the old man of the family. He was an anomaly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell said losing her nephew was “the worst thing possible,” but she is proud of the lives he was able to save. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to be religious, or you can be, but God — if there is a God — he did this. This must have been part of his plan … of some plan,” she said. “I guess he had a plan for my beautiful, sweet nephew.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman will be honored in Utah this summer when his name is added to “The Celebration of Life Monument.” The &lt;a href="https://www.donorconnect.life/celebration-of-life-monument/"&gt;monument is a memorial and tribute&lt;/a&gt; to individuals both living and deceased that have donated organs, tissue, and eyes for either transplant or research in the intermountain area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg" alt="Titus freeman and mom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-805001" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-768x597.jpeg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-860x669.jpeg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-643x500.jpeg 643w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-600x467.jpeg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Titus Freeman with his mom. | Courtesy photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Maybe this will be the year I finally start meal planning or doing morning pages. New year, new me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what if the thing we needed more of was to do less? What if this was the year we finally learned to rest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all involuntarily participate in the stress Olympics, and are aware that the busiest person wins gold,” says Amelia Nagoski, co-author of &lt;a href="https://www.burnoutbook.net/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a culture that glamorizes hard work, sacrifice and the grind, rest is often seen as self-indulgent and lazy, Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not only does this attitude leave us worn out, it’s counterproductive. “Rest is what helps us function at our highest level of capacity,” says Dr &lt;a href="https://www.drdaltonsmith.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Saundra Dalton-Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and &lt;a href="https://www.drdaltonsmith.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of Sacred Rest. Although many people are accustomed to pushing through feelings of tiredness, doing so generally results in a lower quality of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So why not start this year more energized and less depleted? Here’s how to start resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-rest" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Rest is anything that gives you more energy,” says Nagoski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean a cessation of activities, she adds: “Sometimes, it’s just doing different things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Indeed, the most restorative rest is often more active than passive, argues Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with sitting on the couch with a bag of salty snacks in one hand and the TV remote in another,” he says. “But the things that deliver the biggest restorative bang for your buck are things like going for a walk, spending time in nature or exercising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-obstacles-to-rest" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest obstacles to rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a twisted scientist were to sit down and invent a society designed to de-legitimize rest, it would look a lot like ours, says Pang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all come with decades of cultural programming that tells us that in order to succeed, we have to spend enormous amounts of time at work,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is another, more personal obstacle: many people don’t know what kind of rest they need. As we’ll see below, there are many ways to catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="take-rest-seriously" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take rest seriously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So you’re finally open to throwing off the yoke of overwork. But how does one actually incorporate more rest into their lives? If you’ve read this far, that’s a good start. “If you’re asking this question, you’re taking rest seriously,” says Pang. “That’s the first thing you’ve got to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="look-at-how-you-work" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at how you work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you are in a job that allows you to have some control over your schedule, Pang suggests combining periods of deep, focused work – 90 minutes to two hours – with breaks of about half an hour. The break could be running errands, going for a walk or having lunch – anything that’s not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":19,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"220f3eea-5cec-4929-85b5-c137a93f8211","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="220f3eea-5cec-4929-85b5-c137a93f8211" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If your job does not have a predictable schedule, Pang recommends better preserving nights and weekends.

Eventually, she realized the rest she needed was emotional, because the amount of energy required to appear calm in the face of horrible situations was leaving her depleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Drawing on Dalton-Smith’s work, the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mental-health/seven-rest-types" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; put together examples of how to practice the seven types of rest:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Physical rest: making sure you get enough sleep; taking naps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mental rest: journaling; meditating; doing tasks that are not mentally taxing, like puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Emotional rest: talking through feelings and experiences with a friend or therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Social rest: setting aside time alone to recharge; making sure you’re spending time with people who don’t leave you feeling drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sensory rest: spending time outdoors; taking breaks from screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Creative rest: engaging in creative hobbies like drawing, reading or dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spiritual rest: connecting to a cause or tradition that feels meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="enlist-others-for-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist others for help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Perhaps the most important and effective way to incorporate more rest into your life is to recruit other people in your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nagoski explains that she and her twin sister, sex educator and researcher Emily Nagoski, were inspired to write Burnout together after Amelia ended up in an emergency room with stress-induced illness. “My sister drove two-and-a-half hours to the hospital and fed me a big stack of journal articles about rest and the importance of overcoming burnout,” Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts agree this kind of care and support – reminding loved ones that their wellbeing is more important than work – is essential to pushing back against a culture of overwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All these external pressures to sacrifice and give everything you have to give – it’s like a rushing river,” Nagoski says. “If you try to stand against it alone, you’re going to get washed away really fast. But if you surround yourself with people who care about your wellbeing as much as you care about theirs, you can all stand together, and that’s the only way to resist the river.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE81ZW5CRVU1ZUY3RjFHZU9aamJWZ2F1LVJlNGNvWE8ydllyRWJEVVdsd1J0SE1qVkczRmVlUlBZNmNXS2Y1azdUV2NZeGhDWU1XNk90ZjhsR0RHT05vRlFNNm5FVENxdTZVRnZKMExmNi1TaTBTSkhyeg</guid></item><item><title>我们都会犯的一个意大利面错误，以及为什么它会破坏晚餐- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/food/article/r1phjk2h11e</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="714jr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="714jr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="714jr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She’s always there when you need something comforting and quick: just a pot of water with salt and a bit of sauce, and dinner’s ready.

Think again. Every twist, hole and fold in the dough serves a precise culinary-engineering function, all designed to ensure the pasta and sauce pair in perfect harmony. “Just like we wouldn’t expect an Italian to know how to make Israeli food, we also have gaps in understanding pasta,” explains Claude Ben-Itach, owner of the Fresh Pasta factory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="7a0j3-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.ByevUeyhr11l" id="image_ArticleImageData.ByevUeyhr11l"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ByevUeyhr11l" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/18/H17OjRd9HWe/H17OjRd9HWe_0_0_1280_720_0_x-large.jpg" alt="קלוד בן-איטח" title="Claude Ben-Itach  (Photo: Sapir Gordo) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ByevUeyhr11l" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/18/H17OjRd9HWe/H17OjRd9HWe_0_0_1280_720_0_x-large.jpg" alt="קלוד בן-איטח" title="Claude Ben-Itach  (Photo: Sapir Gordo) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Claude Ben-Itach &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Sapir Gordo&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="cf8dg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cf8dg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cf8dg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;So why are there so many shapes?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cf8dg-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“First, you’re talking about a country with a wide range of regions. There’s a big difference between the north and south of Italy — the ingredients behave differently, the temperatures vary. Then there’s the history: before the industrial revolution, most pasta was handmade. There are still shapes that machines can’t replicate. What started out as ‘mistakes’ at home often became classics.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="899rj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="899rj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="899rj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He divides pasta into families: “There are the long, wide noodles like fettuccine, tagliatelle and pappardelle; the short pastas like rigatoni and penne; and the stuffed pastas like ravioli and tortellini. Each of these works best with different kinds of sauces. Short pastas pair well with chunky sauces — seafood, meat, fish. Thin pastas like spaghetti, tagliolini and linguine go best with light, oil-based sauces. Stuffed pastas usually need something delicate like butter — you don’t want to overshadow the filling.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="f5ep6-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.HJeyDlJnrWl" id="image_ArticleImageData.HJeyDlJnrWl"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HJeyDlJnrWl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/18/r1gdoRdcrbl/r1gdoRdcrbl_0_0_1280_853_0_x-large.jpg" alt="פסטה" title="Ravioli  (Photo: Assaf Carla) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HJeyDlJnrWl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/18/r1gdoRdcrbl/r1gdoRdcrbl_0_0_1280_853_0_x-large.jpg" alt="פסטה" title="Ravioli  (Photo: Assaf Carla) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Ravioli &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Assaf Carla&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="2l1id-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2l1id-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2l1id-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;So how do you pair sauce and pasta correctly?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2l1id-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The critical point is that the pasta has to hold the sauce. Long, wide noodles need a thick, rich sauce that clings to them and doesn’t slide off. Take, for example, a mushroom ragù with pappardelle — olive oil wouldn’t cut it; you need something rich and reduced that sticks to the pasta’s width.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="2uqe0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2uqe0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2uqe0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“On the other hand, thin pastas like linguine can’t carry heavy sauces — you’ll just end up with soup. There you need something light, like olive oil-based sauces (aglio e olio). Hollow pastas need sauces that can seep inside and coat them from within, so every bite bursts with flavor. The most important thing to remember: pasta is always the star of the dish — the sauce is the supporting act. If the sauce is what shouts the loudest, something’s gone wrong.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="4c4t3-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4c4t3-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4c4t3-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;After diving into the theory of pasta perfection, it’s time to step into the kitchen. But as it turns out, some of our most instinctive cooking habits may be the very ones sabotaging our pasta. Ben-Itach breaks down the most common mistakes and how to fix them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="bmib0-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="72dub-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="72dub-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72dub-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How do you really know when pasta is done?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72dub-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“We want to avoid overcooking. The classic and simplest method — no need for a culinary degree — is to taste it. Another way is to cut the pasta in half: you’ll see a small white dot in the center. That’s the point you want to reach — and not go past. Also, watch how the pasta behaves in the pot: it shouldn’t sink to the bottom, it should move in circulation. When it’s moving around in the pot, you’re close to done.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="bf6ir-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bf6ir-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bf6ir-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What are the biggest mistakes we make in home cooking?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bf6ir-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The number one mistake is adding oil to the water, thinking it prevents sticking. It doesn’t — and actually does damage. Pasta cooked in oily water comes out coated in oil, so the sauce won’t stick. Another major mistake is rinsing pasta with cold water, which washes away the starch — what we call ‘liquid gold.’ Starch is critical for helping the sauce cling to the pasta, and when you rinse it off, it all goes down the drain and the sauce won’t hold. Also, using a pot that’s too small or not enough water will throw things off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="44tcr-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="e5eq2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e5eq2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e5eq2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What about sauce-making — where do we go wrong there?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e5eq2-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“A classic mistake is burning the onion or garlic. That ruins the flavor and spoils the sauce. With tomato sauce, people often overcook it — if you simmer it for over an hour, the acidity and sugars break down. Another issue is overcrowding the sauce with too many ingredients — people throw in too much, and the sauce becomes overloaded. You end up not really tasting anything. Minimalism is the way to go.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="cecc2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cecc2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cecc2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Any advanced tips to elevate homemade pasta?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cecc2-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Italians pull the pasta out two minutes early — even before it hits al dente — and add it directly into the sauce pan with a splash of the cooking water. Then you simmer everything together for two or three minutes, let it reduce, add a pat of butter at the end — and that’s it. It’s kind of like playing with Play-Doh with your kids. Pasta is forgiving — it’s not one of those dishes where if you mess up, it’s ruined and inedible. I highly recommend experimenting at home, even with your kids. It’s a great activity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="c9eh4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c9eh4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c9eh4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;After mastering how to cook pasta, it’s time to talk nutrition. Dietitian Meital Levy shares how to turn this beloved carb from foe to friend, and reveals a surprising tip that could change the way you think about leftovers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="8bf69-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="c7uhf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c7uhf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c7uhf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What are pasta’s main nutritional values?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c7uhf-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“That depends on the flour. Pasta made from white flour is a fairly simple carbohydrate. On the one hand, it provides quick energy, which makes it great before physical activity. On the other hand, if the pasta is made from whole wheat, it contains fiber, iron, magnesium and selenium. If it’s made from legumes, it offers all the nutritional benefits of legumes — more minerals and fiber. It’s easy to digest and provides long-lasting energy, without the digestive effects sometimes associated with legumes or rice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="4bgpk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4bgpk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4bgpk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How does the sauce affect how healthy the dish is?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4bgpk-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The sauce is a major component of the meal. If you use saturated fat, like cream, the dish becomes less healthy. But if you use tomato-based or vegetable sauces, you’re adding fiber and antioxidants. A sauce made from olive oil and basil or pesto, for example, with added walnuts, is rich in healthy fats.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="7qu19-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="dlbed-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dlbed-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dlbed-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How can home cooks maximize pasta’s health benefits?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dlbed-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Shorter cooking times help preserve nutrients. But there’s a big bonus to eating pasta after it’s been cooled in the fridge, rather than fresh off the stove. Cooling turns its starch into what’s called ‘resistant starch,’ which causes a smaller spike in blood sugar and is easier on the gut — ideal for those with irritable bowel syndrome. For a balanced meal, aim to combine healthy fats (like olive oil or nuts), vegetables in or alongside the sauce, and a protein source.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91j5a" data-offset-key="7tot7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7tot7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7tot7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What’s the healthiest combination?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7tot7-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Whole wheat or lentil pasta is best — it’s high in fiber and minerals. Pair it with a pesto or tomato-based sauce, or one combining olive oil and vegetables. Add in walnuts or pine nuts, and finish with protein — whether that’s cheese in the pasta or a side salad with tuna or another lean protein.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:00:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXkFVX3lxTFBCNklCbHlCZ3pNT0h2VmNYU0ZFSGdSby1tT0tmb0Y3eXVVQTh6NHppMVZKN19aZXlvdjkxVzhkdDlfWV9pOVJVNHl4VlhxbE5ycTRCVE8ycHY4QkVpZVE</guid></item><item><title>安慰剂效应影响疫苗反应-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04168-7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="ethics-content"&gt;

And, while animal studies suggest that activating the brain’s reward system can boost immune defences, the picture in humans has been less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04140-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy volunteers took part in brain training sessions in which they tried different mental strategies to boost activity in particular parts of the brain. They knew how well they were doing thanks to real-time feedback in the form of scores that rose in line with brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After four training sessions, the volunteers were given a hepatitis B vaccine. They then gave blood two and four weeks later, which researchers analysed for antibodies against hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that people who boosted activity in part of the brain’s reward system called the ventral tegmental area (VTA) had the strongest immune response to the vaccine. Those who boosted it most successfully did so through positive expectations, or imagining good things happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The effect may prove useful in boosting patients’ immune systems, but larger trials are needed to show if there is any clear medical benefit. Dr Tamar Koren, a co-author, said the team was investigating whether other parts of the immune system were also affected, such as that responsible for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The approach we tested is intended solely as a complementary tool that may enhance immune responsiveness to vaccination,” said Dr Nitzan Lubianiker, a senior author on the study. “It cannot, and is not meant to, replace vaccines or standard medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jonathan Kipnis, a professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University in St Louis, agreed. “It is probably too early to draw conclusions about the degree of clinical relevance,” he said. “If such effects were shown to matter clinically in a larger clinical trial, they would most likely complement the established treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jeremy Howick, a professor of empathic healthcare at the University of Leicester, said the effect was small and cautioned that sick patients in a clinic may respond differently, but he still saw positives. He said: “Given that it’s free for healthcare professionals to say things that can generate positive expectations, without exaggerating, like: ‘We’re going to do our best to take care of you,’ or: ‘I’ve seen this treatment work for people like you,’ this is a pretty robust signal suggesting we should do more of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQZzRCSVd5bURqUFVoZEZud01CRm9ORGtIOXd2RFlnTlE3TkRUZGJra01aajMtclR6TFdlNGlUVGs4dFJDWFdjWHVIeTgwRkRtR1BORlV5NXUzLWNkaExZZDlwUVJlb21XWlBWYmxGUU9VLWxvWFRnSGNZQ1M3b00yTXFyMldjQ1lpRUdWNHo1Q2RraEYxU1NLdHVJWXM0V3d5YVR2RmdWalFmWUVXTTRvdGd4aXZuYVpr</guid></item><item><title>爸爸咳嗽上床睡觉，死于心脏骤停。6年后，他的儿子也发生了同样的事情（独家） - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/dad-went-bed-cough-died-090000327.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A hospital bed (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Selvey spoke exclusively with PEOPLE about the deaths of her husband, Jason, and their son, Daniel, six years apart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both hda Alagille Syndrome, a genetic condition that can cause liver damage, vitamin deficiencies and affect other organs, including the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was no known family history of Alagille syndrome," said Amber, referring to before Jason's death in 2017 at the age of 47&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in England is attempting to raise awareness of a rare illness following the deaths of her husband and son six years apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While speaking exclusively with PEOPLE, Amber Selvey revealed there was no known family history of &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/dad-loses-30-pounds-become-liver-donor-son-alagille-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alagille Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alagille Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; before her husband Jason Selvey died in 2017 at the age of 47. Alagille Syndrome is a genetic condition that can lead to liver damage and vitamin deficiencies, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23540-alagille-syndrome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like his father, Daniel went to bed with a cough and a cold before suffering heart failure and dying in 2023, just days before his 25th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alagille syndrome can be very difficult to recognize because symptoms vary widely and often appear in isolation rather than as one clear condition,” Amber, 51, told PEOPLE. “Liver problems caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts are one of the most common features, but these range from fairly mild, and only being detected due to blood test abnormalities, to severe disease requiring transplantation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A doctor and a patient (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, “Heart problems are also common and may include narrowing of blood flow from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary stenosis), heart murmurs, or more complex defects such as tetralogy of Fallot. In my eldest son’s case, he had aortic valve stenosis and a bicuspid aortic valve, which was later found at post-mortem to be a unicuspid valve, which is extremely rare. When cardiac issues occur without obvious liver disease, the underlying genetic link can be missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel had previously suffered heart failure in 2021, but Amber was able to resuscitate him at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the COVID period and following his cardiac arrest in 2021, Daniel experienced chest pains and increasingly frequent episodes of collapse, alongside seizure-type activity,” Amber told PEOPLE. “Despite repeated concerns being raised and multiple investigations being carried out, no confirmed cause was identified prior to his sudden death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of five, who lives in Kent, England, previously told UK newspaper &lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2026/01/09/dad-son-went-bed-cough-cold-died-sleep-26181322/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Metro;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that as a baby, Daniel experienced breathing difficulties that led to him being diagnosed with the heart condition aortic valve stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When their next child was found to have another cardiac condition, Amber pushed for the family to undergo genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said three of her children, including Daniel, have &lt;a href="https://people.com/split-liver-transplant-2-year-old-63-year-old-exclusive-8604812" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alagille Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alagille Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, while two do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When my third child was born and became the second of our children to be diagnosed with a cardiac condition, I was not satisfied with the explanation that it was simply unfortunate,” Amber told PEOPLE. “As both a parent and a paediatric nurse, I felt something more was going on and pushed for genetic testing. This led to the diagnosis of Alagille syndrome in our children, which then helped us understand the wider implications for our family as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, “There was no known family history of Alagille syndrome. After our children received their diagnoses, it was traced back to my husband and, most likely, his father, who had sadly already passed away by that time. Without genetic testing, the condition went unrecognised across generations, although with hindsight, his father experienced multiple health problems that may now be viewed differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber said her husband appeared “fit and well” before his symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband was born with one eye that never fully developed and had no sight in it,” she told PEOPLE. “He wore a prosthetic eye. During his childhood. It was assumed to be an isolated birth defect, but it is now understood to be linked to Alagille syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an adult, her husband experienced other common health issues that were overlooked because they were unaware he had the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had recurrent episodes of pneumonia and later developed gout as a result of his liver’s involvement, Amber revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Jason’s death in 2017, a post-mortem found pulmonary artery hypoplasia and underdeveloped heart ventricles, consistent with hypoplastic heart syndrome, per &lt;em&gt;Metro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber told PEOPLE there are several other symptoms of Alagille Syndrome that may be overlooked unless medics are specifically looking for them, including “distinctive facial features, ocular involvement, spinal abnormalities known as “butterfly vertebrae,” kidney disease, or blood vessel abnormalities affecting the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Others may have milder or isolated symptoms such as failure to thrive, malabsorption of fats and vitamins, or a tendency to bruise easily, without these being linked to a broader condition,” said Amber. “Early signs such as prolonged jaundice in babies, persistent itching, cholesterol deposits in the skin (xanthomas), bruising easy, pale stools, dark urine, poor growth, brittle bones, hearing loss, or fatigue can often be dismissed or attributed to more common childhood issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because symptoms can fluctuate, affect different organs at different times, or appear mild, Alagille syndrome is frequently overlooked unless clinicians take a joined-up, whole-person approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She revealed that even with the same family, the severity of the illness can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At present, there are no established medical guidelines for standardised adult Alagille syndrome care, which leads to wide variation in monitoring, treatment, and long-term planning,” Amber told PEOPLE. “Historically, hepatologists have led care, but for adults whose liver is not their primary issue, this can result in fragmented and poorly coordinated oversight.

&lt;p&gt;In a major breakthrough, scientists at Northwestern University have developed an intravenous nanomaterial that not only crosses the blood-brain barrier but actively repairs brain damage after a stroke. In preclinical trials, a &lt;strong&gt;single dose&lt;/strong&gt; administered right after blood flow was restored significantly reduced tissue damage and inflammation, without triggering side effects or toxicity in major organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new treatment targets a dangerous moment in stroke care: the return of blood flow. While necessary to save lives, this process can unleash a wave of harmful immune responses that kill neurons and worsen long-term disability. The injectable therapy appears to counteract this cascade, offering new hope for more complete &lt;strong&gt;recovery&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acute ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting for 80 percent of all cases. It occurs when a clot blocks blood flow to the brain. Though current treatments focus on reopening the blood vessels, they offer no protection against secondary damage. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1104111855/ayush-batra-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Ayush Batra&lt;/a&gt;, a neurocritical care physician at Northwestern Medicine, the absence of such therapies is a critical “unmet need” in neurology today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single dose of the new injectable nanomaterial, tested in mouse models, was shown to travel through the bloodstream and directly into the &lt;strong&gt;site of injury&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain. Developed using &lt;strong&gt;supramolecular peptide assemblies&lt;/strong&gt;, the same technology behind earlier spinal cord regeneration studies, the material reduced signs of inflammation and neuronal damage while avoiding immune rejection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injectable Molecules That Move and Adapt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The therapy is built on supramolecular therapeutic peptides, lab-made molecules designed to move and communicate like biological systems. In earlier work, these materials earned the nickname “&lt;strong&gt;dancing molecules&lt;/strong&gt;” for their ability to restore function after spinal cord injury. Now, researchers have tuned their concentration and structure to allow safe systemic injection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the study published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurotherapeuticsjournal.org/article/S1878-7479(25)00298-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurotherapeutics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the peptide, known as &lt;strong&gt;IKVAV-PA&lt;/strong&gt;, carries a specific laminin-mimetic sequence that promotes neuron survival. After injection, it self-assembles into nanostructures that remain dynamic, moving collectively in ways that increase interaction with damaged cells. These properties allow the therapy to slip through the temporarily permeable blood-brain barrier created after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Add to that a dynamic peptide that is able to cross more readily&lt;/em&gt;,” said Dr. Batra, “&lt;em&gt;and you’re really optimizing the chances that your therapy is going where you want it to go&lt;/em&gt;.” Real-time microscopy confirmed that the molecules not only crossed into the brain but specifically targeted the injured hemisphere, with minimal spread to healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preclinical Results Show Reduced Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the&lt;strong&gt; seven days&lt;/strong&gt; following injection, treated mice showed significantly less tissue damage than those given saline. According to results from cresyl violet staining, infarct size in untreated animals reached &lt;strong&gt;nearly 27 percent&lt;/strong&gt;, while those receiving IKVAV-PA dropped to around 11 percent. These results align with earlier findings on the molecule’s anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further testing revealed an accumulation of microglia and astrocyte activation near the site of stroke, evidence of an active immune response. But animals treated with the peptide showed reduced signs of this inflammation. Immunofluorescence imaging confirmed less cellular stress in the infarcted areas of treated brains, pointing to a protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although tissue damage was significantly reduced, no major &lt;strong&gt;behavioral improvement&lt;/strong&gt; was observed during the short observation window. Mice were tested using the Bederson score and open field exploration, but both groups showed similar activity levels at days 3 and 7. According to the researchers, longer-term studies are needed to assess functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe Delivery With No Side Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most encouraging findings from the study is the absence of systemic toxicity. Researchers monitored organ weights and conducted histological analysis of the kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart. No inflammation or structural abnormalities were observed, suggesting strong biocompatibility of the peptide material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.neurotherapeuticsjournal.org/authored-by/Stupp/Samuel+I" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Samuel Stupp&lt;/a&gt;, who co-led the research and directs the Center for Regenerative Nanomedicine at Northwestern, this delivery method marks a step forward not only for stroke therapy, but for broader neurological treatment. “&lt;em&gt;This systemic delivery mechanism and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/em&gt;,” he explained, “&lt;em&gt;is a significant advance that could also be useful in treating traumatic &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/brains-powerhouses-fuel-your-mind-emotions/" data-type="post" data-id="100441"&gt;brain &lt;/a&gt;injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its success in a mouse model designed to closely mimic human stroke treatment, the peptide therapy shows real potential to be used as an adjunct to existing procedures like &lt;strong&gt;clot removal &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; thrombolytic drugs&lt;/strong&gt;. The therapy works not by reversing stroke, but by helping the brain withstand and recover from the cascade of damage that follows it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the &lt;strong&gt;Center for Regenerative Nanomedicine&lt;/strong&gt; and supported by multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health. As the authors note, future work will focus on refining the material’s regenerative signals and tracking its long-term impact on cognition and neural repair. For now, the results offer a promising new path forward in stroke recovery, one that begins just seconds after the clot is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Tons of tests, products, and regimens promise to extend your lifespan, but living longer doesn’t have to be a time-consuming, bank-breaking enterprise. There are simple habits you can weave into your everyday routine to improve your longevity. The best part? They’re actually backed by science and experts, not just hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blue Zones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—places around the world where people regularly live long lives with far less chronic disease than in the U.S. What Blue Zoners &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do might be surprising: They don’t push through intense workouts, fill their cabinets with supplements, or follow fad diets. They get plenty of exercise, for example, but that’s because walking and other movement is naturally incorporated into their daily routines, not through long, punishing hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistency matters more than intensity when it comes to healthy aging,” says &lt;a href="https://lutanen.com/team/dr-jay-luthar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jay Luthar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jay Luthar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a lifestyle and integrative medicine physician and the founder and medical director of Lutanen Health. “Small, sustainable habits practiced daily often outperform short-term, extreme interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are eight research-backed habits that can help you live longer—and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat more plants.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us could stand to get more plants in our diet: fruit, veggies, greens, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “A predominantly plant-forward diet is one of the most consistently supported strategies for longevity across populations and cultures,” Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants are packed with nutrients to support longevity and prevent chronic illness, including fiber, polyphenols, and antioxidants. They reduce inflammation and cellular damage, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623354841" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve insulin sensitivity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and support gut, cardiovascular, and metabolic health, Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re good for brain health, too. Research has found the powerful polyphenols in berries have &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/18785093241301881" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuroprotective benefits for the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neuroprotective benefits for the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while leafy greens are linked to &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slower cognitive decline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slower cognitive decline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget the beans. “Legumes in the diet are one of the best predictors of longevity in the Blue Zone research,” says &lt;a href="https://princetonlongevitycenter.com/staff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Fein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Fein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., the founder and medical director of &lt;a href="https://princetonlongevitycenter.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Princeton Longevity Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Princeton Longevity Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Variations, such as the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7307430/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nordic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nordic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2017/05/okinawa-diet-eating-living-100/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Okinawa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Okinawa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; diets, also prioritize seasonal plants, minimally processed foods, healthy fats, and fish as a source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Move more.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular physical activity is one of the most powerful interventions we have for extending both lifespan and healthspan,” says Dr. Luthar. Exercise improves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6557987/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9256523/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377236/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, incorporate more &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a69463400/zone-zero-exercise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:non-exercise movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;non-exercise movement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your day—like walking and chores—to stay continuously active. That’s better than one intense hour at the gym followed by 12 hours of being sedentary, says Dr. Fein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Build strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle keeps us strong, upright, and functional. It also helps to maintain metabolic health. “Muscle is the main organ for controlling blood sugar,” says Dr. Fein. “When you lose muscle and when you are sedentary, you become more insulin-resistant. Not only does this accelerate aging, but it is also one of the determinants of your &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124000603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of developing type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.70134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lose a small percentage of our muscle mass;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lose a small percentage of our muscle mass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every year starting around age 35. Strength training can help to build muscle and slow down its loss—and you don’t need to become a bodybuilder for it to work. “Resistance training two times per week is sufficient for most people to see meaningful benefits,” says Dr. Luthar. Try &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/a40035772/how-to-start-lifting-weights-for-beginners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:working out with free weights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;working out with free weights&lt;/a&gt; and resistance bands, and doing bodyweight exercises, like squats and planks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Cut way back on alcohol.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but research indicates there’s no harmless amount of alcohol. “Even just one drink per day may have negative effects on your health,” says Dr. Fein. When alcohol is metabolized, it produces &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acetaldehyde" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaldehyde;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can damage DNA and interfere with its repair mechanism. This can put us more at risk for certain cancers and other diseases. Not only that, but alcohol can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224001345" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disrupt sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disrupt sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, speed up &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/one-alcoholic-drink-day-linked-reduced-brain-size" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and increase &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016882272300654X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:visceral fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;visceral fat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking is deeply woven into our social fabric, so it can be hard to put a complete kibosh on it. One tactic to &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a61986397/what-happens-to-body-when-stop-drinking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink more moderately;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink more moderately&lt;/a&gt; could be to save alcohol for special occasions and long dinners with friends or family, Dr. Luthar suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Manage stress.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress does a number on our mental and physical health. “Chronic stress has profound effects on longevity through its impact on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159121000192" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168010221002078" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41569-024-01024-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular health;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs42255-025-01388-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic regulation;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic regulation&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Luthar says. “Persistent activation of the stress response can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159122001477" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accelerate biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;accelerate biological aging&lt;/a&gt; and increase the risk of chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eliminating stress entirely isn’t feasible, finding healthy coping strategies can help keep it under control. &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness/meditation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meditation, breathwork;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meditation, breathwork&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1370399/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yoga,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;yoga,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-35987-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercise;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01612840.2025.2512006#abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creative hobbies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;creative hobbies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41380-023-02122-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:time in nature;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;time in nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are all research-backed ways to squash stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Maintain social relationships.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your friends close can help you live longer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953623007761" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Strong social and family relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strong social and family relationships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are one of the best predictors of longevity. &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/the-importance-of-connections-ways-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Loneliness and social isolation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Loneliness and social isolation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can actually increase our risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a strong social life appears to strongly correlate with a better chance of not only living longer but also maintaining good health and quality of life in the later decades,” Dr. Fein says. Social engagement can boost our mood and relieve stress, which has positive implications throughout the body. The stimulation that comes from conversation and interaction with others can also keep our brains sharp, Fein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Limit added sugar and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diets high in added sugar and ultra-processed foods are associated with increased risks of obesity, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39286398/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64656683/study-ultraprocessed-foods-premature-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:premature mortality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;premature mortality&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Luthar says. Plus, they are often nutrient-poor and can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266614972500043X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increase inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a longevity perspective, minimizing ultra-processed foods and focusing on whole, minimally processed ingredients are more impactful than strict calorie-counting,“ Dr. Luthar says. Pay attention to ingredient lists, choose produce that’s in season and locally grown whenever possible, cook more at home, and focus on fiber-rich, plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Prioritize sleep.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html#:~:text=The%20CDC's%20PLACES%20has%20local%20estimates%20on,conditions%20*%20Improve%20your%20attention%20and%20memory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of quality sleep a night. “Sleep is foundational to nearly every aspect of health and longevity,” Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep accelerates biological aging, he adds. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chronic sleep deprivation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, obesity, and diabetes. That’s because the brain and body go into clean-up and repair mode while we sleep, and they can’t finish their work when we don’t get enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and research agree that simple healthy habits can help us live longer. Consistency, not intensity, is the key. Several of these habits are diet-related, including eating more plant foods and less ultra-processed foods, and limiting or eliminating alcohol and added sugar. Regular sleep and exercise, including both cardio and weight training, can also increase our lifespan and healthspan. Maintaining strong social relationships and managing stress can add years to our lives and also make those years more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:15:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9UWFRud0NSYnBPYS05aXdRTHNYcjkyUDJISm5ZMUdMMElGQ291X0tWdEh0WDc0Z2hzZDZYbE1ZTkdoa3pxOGZaeHl3dXZBMVZBTkhza3NuNWFVUWN0TGxwMENnWXZ2dHowZ0tuLUxoSTkxMkFiQTN6Rg</guid></item><item><title>伯尔尼山地犬期待已久的拥抱来自新的金毛犬兄弟姐妹的一切-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/bernese-mountain-dogs-long-awaited-151000580.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My senior &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/little-dachshund-attempts-to-boss-cow-around" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dachshund;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dachshund&lt;/a&gt; wasn't thrilled when we adopted her much younger Pug mix brother.

Rocco wasn't interested and just turned his head, hoping to give Binky the hint. But the Bernese Mountain Dog didn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Rocco has been very slow taking to his new sister," the online text explained. "But she keeps trying and trying to win his affection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rocco fidgeted around as Binky continued nuzzling her fur baby brother, refusing to give up on getting a snuggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At one point, Binky placed both front paws on the couch and wrapped Rocco up in a hug. It was almost like she said, "Ok big brother, enough is enough, let's break down these walls!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Golden Retriever looked at his sister and either felt moved to return the embrace or simply got tired of the cold shoulder routine. He placed his paw on the Bernese beauty to hug her back, much to the delight of their mom watching the whole scene unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This has given me hope," the caption read.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1s like Ozempic can support weight loss but may increase risk of nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend stocking up on nutrient-dense foods like beans, berries, yogurt, chicken and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For personalized recommendations, work one-on-one with a registered dietitian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 70% of adults in the United States are classified as having overweight or obesity. With the growing availability of GLP-1 medications for weight loss, many people are turning to these prescriptions as part of their health journey.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, recent data suggests that about 12% of U.S. adults have used a GLP-1 medication, such as Ozempic.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ozempic, also known as semaglutide, is a popular GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonist that helps regulate appetite and blood sugar.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It works by slowing digestion so you feel full longer, stimulating insulin release to lower blood glucose levels and acting on appetite centers in the brain to reduce hunger and food cravings,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these medications can be effective, what you eat still matters—especially when appetite is reduced. People taking GLP-1 medications need to be especially intentional with their food choices and prioritize nutrient-dense foods, says &lt;a href="https://www.laineyyounkin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lainey Younkin, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that many individuals on weight-loss medications fall short on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;key nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, including fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, choline and vitamins A, C, D and E.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, they often fail to meet &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17573/what-is-a-serving-of-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended servings for fruits&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables, grains and dairy, while exceeding suggested limits for total fat and saturated fat.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;These gaps raise clear concerns and highlight the importance of choosing foods that deliver maximum nutrition in smaller portions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, many foods fit the bill. Here are 8 dietitian-recommended foods to add to your cart each week if you’re taking Ozempic on another GLP-1 medication.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tiny but mighty, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-blackberries-good-for-you-11773841" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries pack a serious nutrient punch&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their fiber and antioxidant content. “Berries are packed with anthocyanins, antioxidants that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Berries also result in a lower glycemic response than several other fruits, with a 1-cup serving of raspberries coming in at 8 grams of fiber.”&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That fiber works alongside Ozempic to help increase feelings of fullness while also supporting good bowel health. Younkin adds that higher intakes of anthocyanins have been associated with lower visceral fat stores and greater gut microbiome diversity—both of which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Whether you buy them fresh or frozen, they’re equally nutritious. For a quick, nutritious snack, try making a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-berry-bowl-8710522" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese-Berry Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a nutrient powerhouse, providing protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. For example, a ½-cup serving of cooked black beans delivers about 7 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Together, these nutrients help support satiety and promote regular digestion while taking Ozempic, notes Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans also supply key nutrients that may be lacking in the diet of Ozempic users, including folate, potassium, iron and zinc. They also contain antioxidants, such as anthocyanins found in black and red kidney beans.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another bonus: beans are affordable and convenient to use. Simply open a can, rinse them well and add them to salads, soups or main meals, says Harris-Pincus.  For an easy, nourishing dinner, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-quinoa-skillet-7165974" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Black Bean &amp;amp; Quinoa Skillet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason chicken tops the charts in many weight loss programs: it’s packed with protein and is naturally low in fat and carbohydrates, notes Younkin. A 3-ounce serving of chicken breast provides about 24 grams of protein for just 120 calories, making it an easy fit in an Ozempic-friendly meal plan.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The protein content keeps you full and satisfied and helps support muscle growth,” says Younkin. “I love buying a rotisserie chicken each week and using it throughout the week in salads, soups, quesadillas and wraps.” For a comforting casserole that still delivers on protein, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883913/chicken-cauliflower-rice-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Cauliflower-Rice Casserole&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both Harris-Pincus and Younkin recommend eating fatty fish at least twice per week, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring and tuna. These fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids—particularly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)—which have been linked to improved heart and metabolic health.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish also provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, helping you feel fuller for longer while preserving muscle mass, an important consideration when appetite is reduced on GLP-1 medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; New to fish or feeling intimidated? Start with canned salmon in these crowd-pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270549/salmon-stuffed-avocados/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Salmon-Stuffed Avocados&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Strained (Greek-style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another favorite of both Harris-Pincus and Younkin is strained (Greek-style) yogurt. One cup provides about 25 grams of high-quality protein and roughly 21% the Daily Value for calcium for just 165 calories, both of which are important nutrients to prioritize while taking a GLP-1 medication.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some varieties also contain probiotics, those good-for-you microorganisms that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut and immune health&lt;/a&gt; and may play a role in weight management.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s an amazing vessel to build a protein and fiber-filled yogurt bowl with fruit, nuts, seeds and whole grain cereal,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many whole grains can help you meet your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber needs&lt;/a&gt;, oats stand out for their beta-glucan content, a type of soluble fiber that supports gut health and helps lower cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “To put it in perspective, half a cup of oats has 4 grams of fiber, almost twice as much as one cup of broccoli that has 2 grams,” says Younkin.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="15" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber is especially important when taking Ozempic, as it not only works with the medication to increase fullness and keep blood sugar balanced, but it can also help prevent constipation,” Younkin adds.&lt;span data-cite="16" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats are an easy, flexible option, and portions can be adjusted to suit smaller appetites. Try our fan-favorite &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-strawberry-peanut-butter-overnight-oats-8611753" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-Protein Strawberry &amp;amp; Peanut Butter Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-prunes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Prunes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to digestive health, prunes are an often-overlooked standout. “Everyone knows prunes help to keep things “moving” and that’s even more relevant for folks taking GLP-1 medications,” shares Harris-Pincus. “These bite-sized nutritional gems also contain vitamin K, boron and polyphenol antioxidants, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support bone health&lt;/a&gt;, an often overlooked but critical consideration with weight loss, especially for perimenopausal and menopausal women.”&lt;span data-cite="17" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="18" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A serving of 4 to 5 prunes delivers about 3 grams of fiber along with over 11 vitamins and minerals.&lt;span data-cite="18" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Given that nutrient shortfalls are common among people with GLP-1 medications, choosing a nutrient-dense food like prunes can help fill important gaps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a balanced snack, pair prunes with a source of protein, such as cottage cheese, or a healthy fat, like slivered almonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-vegetables"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 8. Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to vegetables, the more variety, the better. “It’s hard to pick just one vegetable you should buy every week because the most nutritious option is to mix it up every week to get a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of colorful fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; into your diet,” explains Younkin. “Each color delivers different antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and keep your gut microbiome thriving. This means you get more health benefits than if you rely on Ozempic alone.”&lt;span data-cite="19" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-when-taking-ozempic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Tips When Taking Ozempic &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with prioritizing good nutrition, consider these other tips to support your health while taking Ozempic:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with a Registered Dietitian.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to work closely with a registered dietitian to help ensure you’re meeting your individual nutrient needs while taking a GLP-1. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Strength Training.&lt;/strong&gt; “Strength training is a non-negotiable when taking Ozempic”, says Younkin. While Ozempic can help with fat loss, it may also reduce muscle mass unless you actively work to preserve lean muscle. Aim for 2–3 strength training sessions per week.&lt;span data-cite="20" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;Grab that reusable water bottle before you head out the door! Adequate hydration helps prevent constipation, a common side effect when taking GLP-1s like Ozempic.&lt;span data-cite="21" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; GLP-1 medications like Ozempic can support weight loss, but they may also increase the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Because appetite is often reduced on these medications, dietitians recommend focusing on foods that deliver maximum nutrition in smaller servings. Berries, beans, chicken, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, fatty fish, vegetables, oats and prunes are all nutrient-packed options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_76-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, working one-on-one with a registered dietitian is also important to make sure you’re meeting your personal nutrition needs.

ROACH: Why do people still die of pneumonia? With all the advances that we have seen in modern medicine, losing anyone to this ailment seems like such a waste. Is it a question of pneumonia being difficult to pin down because of the root cause, whether it’s bacterial, viral or fungal? Is it due to a delayed diagnosis and/or delayed treatment? Is it the development of drug-resistant pneumonia strains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G6DO64O7IZEETIVSNLVIEZJVLE"&gt;I just don’t get why people still die from pneumonia or “complications” from pneumonia. I’m a 73-year-old stroke and cancer survivor who is in relatively good health. How can I best avoid getting pneumonia myself? -- D.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZHQ4WOS4NJAXTHTVBQROYRJRC4"&gt;ANSWER: Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, sometimes called a “lower respiratory tract” infection to distinguish it from an “upper respiratory infection,” like bronchitis. The majority of pneumonias are bacterial or viral, but fungal pneumonia is a rare cause that is usually seen in hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WPZZ456ZF5AVDH5MFI4ZJ6YTAY"&gt;You did a very good job of identifying some of the reasons that people still get very sick (and even die) of pneumonia, but an important additional reason is that there are some bacteria that grow very fast and are able to overwhelm the body’s immune system within days. It is often true that late medical attention allows the infection to progress to the point that we still lose patients from pneumonia, even with all that modern medicine can offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRQ77WNBMVE3LIDLNEN7ZZ4ZAM"&gt;Another reason is that when people are very frail, either because they are very old or have other underlying health conditions, the body’s defenses are weak. Antibiotics can only do so much; doctors still rely on the body to do most of the work by getting rid of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6GWHUGX3H5EXLEZLMIAH2IW3OM"&gt;Drug resistance is a big problem, especially inside the hospital. I have seen cases where the bacteria are resistant to all the available antibiotics. There has been a race between the ingenuity of drug developers and bacterial evolution, and our ingenuity has been slowing down lately, with fewer new types of antibiotics being discovered and released. Avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics helps reduce resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J5CSI4GIWVGPRCX4K5ONWELSGQ"&gt;The easiest thing a person over 50 can do to avoid pneumonia is get the available vaccines, especially the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV20 or PCV21, called Prevnar). But for a person with health issues in their 70s, you should get the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 vaccines. Because influenza damages the lung’s ability to fight off infection, getting pneumonia after the flu is particularly dangerous, so the annual flu vaccine remains important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YMSPJTDJ7ZARJLROCD3FIDEGS4"&gt;Smoking also damages the lung’s ability to fight off infections, so quitting smoking reduces pneumonia risk. Excess alcohol consumption also predisposes people to pneumonia, so men shouldn’t exceed 2 drinks at a time (1 for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XLABEISHJBDEJBPED6SKUDU5DY"&gt;Proper nutrition and good dental health are important for everyone. Diabetics should have their diabetes under good control. Chronic liver, lung, kidney and heart disease all predispose people to infections, so making sure that these are optimally managed reduces the risk further. Both cancer and its treatments can affect the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z2LZKSK7ONB3BP4634ITNP2ZDI"&gt;People who are at risk for pneumonia should know the signs and seek medical care quickly if pneumonia is suspected. Although the classic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath can occur at any age, older people often have confusion and low fever. The heart rate is often raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J2A754WT2NB6TMBTZXN4U2XRAM"&gt;Some symptoms can be subtle: new falls, incontinence, and loss of energy. A significant, unexplained change in overall functioning might signify a serious infection like pneumonia and deserves an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Berries can be enjoyed stirred into oatmeal or yogurt, used as a topping or blended in smoothies like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-lemon-blueberry-smoothie-8363288" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Lemon-Blueberry Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you like them scrambled, boiled or sunny-side up, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs are a nutrient-dense food&lt;/a&gt; that fits seamlessly into the Mediterranean diet. “Eggs are packed with choline, B vitamins, vitamin D and selenium, which are responsible for various aspects of brain health, including mood and cognition,” Zozos explains.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that they are also a great source of protein and beneficial fats, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which support brain, joint and heart health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those craving a little crunch early in the morning, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts like almonds are the perfect addition&lt;/a&gt; to a Mediterranean-diet breakfast. Their natural crunch provides a satisfying contrast to creamy or soft foods, helping to elevate dishes like yogurt parfaits or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259665/berry-almond-smoothie-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Berry-Almond Smoothie Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Almonds not only enhance the texture of meals but are also packed with essential nutrients like fiber, healthy fats, protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to increase the nutritional value of your breakfast. Russell shares that chia seeds are packed with fiber, polyphenols and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that protect heart health, support healthy blood pressure and balance blood sugar levels.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re looking for ways to add these tiny but mighty seeds to your A.M. meal, Russell suggests sprinkling them over peanut butter on sourdough bread, topped with sliced bananas, hemp seeds and a light drizzle of honey. You can also add chia seeds to your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-smoothie-8557968" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkle them over &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-upgrade-for-overnight-oats-8773039" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or mix them into our thick and creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/strawberry-chia-pudding-8756143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Strawberry Chia Pudding&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to traditional breakfast foods, butter is often the go-to source of fat. However, Russell points out that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; takes center stage in the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. “It provides both flavor and dimension to any dish while also working to reduce the risk of heart disease,” she explains. The heart-protective benefits of olive oil stem from its abundance of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Russell recommends using olive oil in place of butter to cook eggs or even on your toast. “One delicious way to add olive oil to breakfast is to try out a tomato-and-basil bruschetta over sourdough with a runny egg topped with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil,” she suggests. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/avocado-toast-with-jammy-eggs-8648174" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Avocado Toast with Jammy Eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which is finished with an olive oil touch.

Whether the star of your morning meal is strained (Greek-style) yogurt, oats, berries, eggs, salmon, almonds, chia seeds or olive oil, each bite can help fuel your morning and lead a healthier lifestyle.

Let's be honest–placing a chicken nugget on a table in front of a pair of Goldens and asking them to wait is basically setting them up for instant failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One mom recently shared a hilarious TikTok video putting her two &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-pulls-off-ultimate-113500022.html" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retrievers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Golden Retrievers&lt;/a&gt;’ willpower to the test, and the imaginary commentary is just as funny as the end result. TikToker @tuckerbudzyn placed one chicken nugget in front of Tucker, the older pup on the left, and Todd, the younger one on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She tells them to “leave it” and then leaves the room. As they watch her walk away, you can feel the tension rise, with both pups trying to decide what to do about the delicious, tempting piece of meat sitting just inches away and staring them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Poor Todd &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/golden-retriever-goes-battle-against-114500149.html" data-ylk="slk:didn’t stand a chance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;didn’t stand a chance&lt;/a&gt;—he was drooling before she even left the room. Tucker’s strategy, on the other hand, seemed to be working, as he kept his gaze fixed in the direction their mom disappeared. It was as if he knew that the moment he looked at the nugget, it would call to him even louder than it already was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/yorkies-field-trip-mcdonalds-most-120000965.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Yorkies Take Field Trip to McDonalds in Most Adorable Fast-Food Run Ever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Yorkies Take Field Trip to McDonalds in Most Adorable Fast-Food Run Ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tucker even appeared to be sending telepathic messages to Todd, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the breaded hunks of chicken since Mom walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, the temptation proved too great, and both Golden Retrievers finally caved. They scarfed those chicken nuggies down in a single gulp. Of course, when Mom returns and asks, “Does someone want to tell me what happened?” both boys clam up immediately. Tucker lays his head on the table, while Todd decides he’ll be much safer hiding underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Funny Reactions From the Comment Section&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This video went viral quickly, with more than 50K likes on TikTok. Many fans expressed their support for the boys, including one person who said, "In their defense, you technically didn’t specify how long they needed to leave it. You only told them that you’d be right back. So in conclusion, they’re innocent of any wrongdoing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another commenter wrote, "In Tucker's defense, he HAD to eat his, otherwise Todd would have!" and he's probably not wrong! Todd was definitely ready to eat the second chicken nugget if Tucker didn't go for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One fan summed it up perfectly, joking, “They have more self-control than me… mine would’ve been gone in a second!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people in the comments mentioned how long it had been since they’d last seen Tucker and Todd. I think I speak for all their fans when I say we’re very happy to have them back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-siblings-failed-chicken-nugget-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Jan 19, 2026, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating one avocado a week can help lower LDL cholesterol and support HDL cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocados are rich in potassium, which may help regulate blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocados are versatile and can replace butter or oil in recipes for a heart-friendly boost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; are an important part of your diet—and yet, they’re often misunderstood. Unsaturated fats from sources such as avocado may have a different effect on your heart and cardiovascular system than you’d expect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; David Sabgir, M.D., is a cardiologist and spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://loveonetoday.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocados - Love One Today&lt;/a&gt;. And so as a heart health and avocado expert, it was only fitting that we ask him about the fruit and its effects on the cardiovascular system when eaten regularly. Here’s what he has to say about avocados and their benefits on cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-avocados-affect-your-cardiovascular-system"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Avocados Affect Your Cardiovascular System &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Lower LDL Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sabgir notes that one of the key benefits of avocados is their impact on one’s cholesterol, especially when prioritized. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Avocados are one of the only fruits with good fats, mostly monounsaturated fats,” the cardiologist says. “These good fats help lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol and support ‘good’ HDL cholesterol, which is key to reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular consumption of the fruit means better cholesterol—and by “regular consumption,” we mean that even just one avocado a week can help you reap its cholesterol-friendly benefits.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether you’re a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8029771/avocado-toast-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocado toast&lt;/a&gt; or prefer a side of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261795/almost-chipotles-guacamole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;guacamole&lt;/a&gt;, the avocado’s deliciousness can also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;support the good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in your body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Might Improve Your Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to keep your blood pressure steady, adding avocados into your diet is an easy start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Avocados are sodium, sugar and cholesterol-free, contributing nearly 20 nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and phytonutrients,” Sabgir shares. “One of these minerals is potassium, which helps keep blood pressure in check and blood vessels healthy.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And per the doctor, “one serving of avocado (1/3 of a medium avocado) provides 6% of your daily needs of potassium. A diet rich in potassium helps to offset some of sodium’s harmful effects on blood pressure.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include bananas, salmon, yogurt and white beans. So recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ginger-dill-salmon-with-cucumber-avocado-salad-11679368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Ginger-Dill Salmon with Cucumber &amp;amp; Avocado Salad&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899506/avocado-banana-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Avocado &amp;amp; Banana Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; are ideal for a bite or sip loaded with the mineral.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Not Impact Your Overall Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While avocados are beneficial for your cholesterol and blood pressure, they may not boost your heart health in general. The cardiologist references a 2025 study (funded by the Avocado Nutrition Center) that showcases the overall benefits of eating the green produce once a day.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Avocado consumption improved diet quality and sleep health and reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels compared to adults who didn’t eat avocado,” Sabgir states on the study’s findings. “Avocados didn’t impact the overall heart health score defined by the American Heart Association.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although avocados did not influence the study participants’ heart health scores (measured by key factors such as weight, blood sugar and exercise), intake does show improvements for some of the cardiovascular system’s functions.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados may have a positive effect on cardiovascular function. While it may not directly impact your heart health, eating more avocados could lower your LDL cholesterol and improve your blood sugar. And avocados are versatile, so they can be incorporated into a variety of meals, whether savory or sweet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research has indicated that drinking coffee may increase health span by two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee contains antioxidants that may help protect against chronic conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick with 2-3 cups/day of coffee and limit added sugar or artificial sweeteners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee sure has made the rounds regarding its health status. Many years ago, it was thought to be a noxious habit.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More recently, however, evidence is mounting toward its beneficial effects on health. If you’re a coffee drinker, you know one benefit is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop-8558449" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it gets things moving in the morning&lt;/a&gt; (buh-bye constipation!). But that’s just the tip of the coffee bean. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking coffee &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;has also been linked to&lt;/a&gt; a reduced risk of heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and it may help your thyroid work better. You’ve probably also noticed that a cup of joe can make you feel happier and more energetic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what about longevity? Could that coffee habit help you live longer? Researchers in Portugal wanted to know, too, so they did a large review of existing studies to see what research to date has shown; here's what they found.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-do-we-know-about-coffee-and-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Do We Know About Coffee and Health? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These researchers combed through studies and meta-analyses that had previously been published and compiled them into this one review. This was a very involved and thorough review—the researchers analyzed data from more than 50 studies done in the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, they discussed the aging process and how various bodily systems tend to deteriorate as we age, including how this affects the way we interact within our environment. For example, eyesight and hearing tend to be reduced as we age, which can influence how quickly we age if they’re not tended to. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They went on to discuss how coffee contains over 2,000 potentially bioactive substances, many of which act like antioxidants. Of course, coffee also contains caffeine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then went on to investigate what studies suggest coffee’s influence is on life span, as well as diseases, conditions and health habits that affect life span—like heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory diseases. They also looked at coffee’s impact on cognition, depression and sleep. Then to go even further, they examined evidence of coffee’s impact on the body at the cellular level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately there was one overarching finding. Regular coffee consumption seems to increase not just life span, but also health span (quality of life), by decreasing the incidence of the primary age-associated diseases that contribute to early death. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They concluded that regularly drinking coffee was associated with preserving muscular, cardiovascular, mental and immune system functions. And it reduces the risk of diseases that commonly affect the elderly, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, stroke, some cancers, diabetes, dementia, major depression and frailty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly drinking coffee may even help you better adapt to stressful situations. And when you can gracefully handle stress—and nix some of your stressors—you reduce your disease risk and may live longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bringing all the evidence together, regular coffee drinkers may enjoy an extra two years of life. And it’s not just more years, but years with good health. Because really, what good is a longer life if you don’t also have a good quality of life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like most things, more is not necessarily better, and this is true with coffee. The researchers found that the sweet spot tends to be between 2 and 3 cups per day. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;If you overdo it&lt;/a&gt;, you may experience anxiety, sleeplessness, jitteriness and racing heart rate—to name a few. And the health benefits don’t increase with more, and they may even diminish. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few caveats to note. First, most research on coffee has been done on younger people, under age 65. So the researchers could not necessarily transfer some of the findings to older adults. For example, they couldn’t say with any level of certainty that regularly drinking coffee will reduce heart disease risk in healthy 80-year-olds since many of the studies were done on young and middle-aged adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the studies were observational, so coffee intake was recorded by participants (like as part of a food diary). This means that researchers depended on participants being honest about their coffee intake—including the amount of coffee they drank and whether the coffee was black or contained cream, sugar, flavor shots, artificial sweeteners, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These researchers note that tea and chocolate have similar bioactive components to coffee, so if you’re not a coffee drinker, don’t feel like you need to start a java habit just for the benefits. We’ve previously reported on other health habits that have also shown an association with living longer—like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-increase-odds-of-living-longer-by-28-per-new-study-8661763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;replacing sitting time with light physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists aren’t yet sure what components in coffee are responsible for all these health benefits—the bioactive compounds or the caffeine. It might be a little bit of both, but more research is needed to figure that out. They’re also still trying to figure out through what mechanisms coffee benefits the body. One pathway they’re leaning toward is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962690/does-coffee-cause-inflammation-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;black coffee may reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. And when we have lower inflammation, we have a lower risk of disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until scientists figure it all out, know that your coffee habit might help you enjoy a longer life. Just skip the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912339/the-best-and-worst-things-to-add-to-your-coffee-according-to-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavor boosters&lt;/a&gt;—at least most of the time—since we know that too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;, saturated fat and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; can wreak havoc on health over time. Also, focus on other health habits known to reduce disease risk and potentially add years to your life. This includes eating a varied, balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing your stressors, getting plenty of quality sleep and spending time with loved ones.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNX0lyNGxGbFNiLS1ON3FFWlJhZDdPa2kySmNSZkNfMEh6UDRWUk5uTnQ4ZXljZENXbmRhTlZWQWRvbW11c2Q1QjEzclNfMGxQWk1nV1hCMUg5emNCVWJyOFBqRE9Ma2F6OWlSaG14RzhMLTZ3MW1KUFFrdHVEVkYxYWFoY1BhU3c</guid></item><item><title>想减肥吗？健康教练分享了早上在柠檬水以外的饮食中添加柠檬的6种方法|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/trying-to-lose-weight-wellness-coach-shares-6-ways-to-add-lemon-to-your-diet-beyond-lemon-water-in-the-morning-101768815933093.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Lemon water has long been linked with weight loss, and many people start their day with a warm glass of lemon water, hoping it will burn fat.&lt;/span&gt; While lemon alone cannot lead weight loss, it can support it when used the right way. Lemon is low in calories, rich in vitamin C, and adds flavour without adding sugar or fat. It can help improve hydration, digestion, and appetite control. These factors play an important role in weight management. According to health and wellness coach Gurpreet Grover, relying only on morning lemon water is not enough. Instead, adding lemon in different forms throughout the day can make healthy eating easier, tastier, and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="artImage leadImage"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=""&gt;Try these easy ways to include lemon in your daily diet. (Adobe Stpck)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can lemon support weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Improves hydration: &lt;/strong&gt;Drinking lemon water encourages people to drink more fluids. A study published in Nutricion Hospitalaria found that better hydration supports appetite control and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Rich in vitamin C: &lt;/strong&gt;"Vitamin C helps protect cells, supports immunity, and improves overall metabolic health," Grover tells &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/health-benefits-with-lemon-water/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Aids digestion:&lt;/strong&gt; Citric acid in lemon helps stimulate digestive juices. A 2022 study in the European Journal of Nutrition showed that lemon juice can boost gastric acid secretion, supporting digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Supports fullness:&lt;/strong&gt; Lemon water and lemon-rich meals may help reduce overeating by promoting a feeling of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Helps manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; The aroma and taste of lemon can have a calming effect, which may reduce stress-related eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 easy ways to add lemon to your diet for weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Start your day with plain lemon water&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting your day with warm lemon water helps improve hydration after sleep and may gently stimulate digestion. Proper hydration is linked to better metabolism and reduced overeating. Skip adding honey or sugar to keep calories low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Use lemon as a salad dressing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Use fresh lemon juice with olive oil, herbs, and spices as a dressing instead of creamy sauces," says Grover. Lemon adds flavour without excess calories and helps reduce reliance on high-sodium or sugar-laden condiments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Add lemon to herbal teas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding lemon to green tea, ginger tea, or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drink-a-cup-of-cinnamon-tea-every-day-to-prevent-blood-sugar-spikes-know-all-benefits-101711449858172.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cinnamon tea"&gt;cinnamon tea&lt;/a&gt; can enhance flavour and encourage regular fluid intake. Green tea combined with lemon may also improve antioxidant absorption, supporting metabolic health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Use lemon zest to flavour food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grated lemon zest can elevate dishes like stir-fries, grilled vegetables, soups, or roasted chicken. Strong citrus flavour helps reduce the need for excess salt or heavy sauces, supporting a calorie-conscious diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Pair lemon with protein-rich meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding lemon to paneer, fish, lentils, or grilled meats can enhance iron absorption and digestion. Protein-rich meals keep you fuller for longer, indirectly supporting weight loss by reducing unnecessary snacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Drink lemon-infused water&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/dietitian-shares-5-diabetes-friendly-food-swaps-that-actually-work-swap-sugary-drinks-for-infused-water-101757923460686.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Infused water"&gt;Infused water&lt;/a&gt; with lemon slices, mint, cucumber, or berries. This makes plain water more appealing, helping you stay hydrated, which plays a key role in controlling appetite and boosting metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Choose lemon-based chutneys and dips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use lemon juice in homemade chutneys, yoghurt dips, or hummus. These lighter options can replace calorie-dense spreads and mayonnaise-based dips while still adding tang and freshness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;According to Grover, lemon supports weight loss only when combined with balanced meals, enough protein, regular physical activity, and good sleep. Extreme lemon detox drinks or skipping meals can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

						&lt;p&gt;You know what they say—with age comes wisdom. But that’s not the only thing. With age also comes sarcopenia, the natural &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-rebuild-lost-leg-muscle-after-65/" target="_blank"&gt;loss of muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is it frustrating, but this process also places you at greater risk of falling and getting injured. It makes performing daily tasks challenging as well. If you want to do something to prevent it, it’s essential to start working out regularly. We spoke with experts to learn five daily exercises that will &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/4-simple-exercises-restore-muscle-after-60/" target="_blank"&gt;restore muscle&lt;/a&gt; faster than &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-gym-machines-for-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;gym machines&lt;/a&gt; after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restoring Muscle as You Age&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you hit 45, muscle loss isn’t just about lifting heavy—it’s about retraining your nervous system to support productive movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As estrogen declines, women lose fast-twitch muscle fibers, and the brain becomes less efficient at activating muscle. Intentional full-body strength workouts that incorporate functional mobility and intense jump training send a much stronger ‘keep this muscle’ signal than isolated machine exercises done a few times a week,” explains &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/shannamissettnelson/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shanna Missett Nelson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and chief choreographer—&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.jazzercise.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jazzercise, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily exercises typically use functional movements that fire up multiple muscle groups and improve balance and muscular coordination—both of which are essential for staying fit as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Makes These Exercises More Effective Than Gym Machines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Nelson, gym machines were made for isolation and safety—but they’re not meant to “rebuild the systems that actually drive strength during perimenopause and beyond.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike gym machines that often isolate muscles, these exercises encourage integrated muscle engagement, leading to improved overall strength and balance. They enhance neuromuscular connections, allowing for quicker and more efficient muscle responses, resulting in better motor control and athletic performance,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_neu_gym/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daniella Rivka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Neuro Restorative Movement Specialist and co-founder of The Neu Gym—Dallas’s first boutique adaptive gym dedicated to neurological recovery, tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, many &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-exercises-for-strength-and-longevity/" target="_blank"&gt;functional exercises&lt;/a&gt; build strength in the core, promoting better posture and stability. The natural range of motion in these exercises replicates daily movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivka points out, “Embracing functional exercises cultivates a holistic approach to fitness that not only supports muscle strength but also enhances overall functionality and quality of life for individuals, particularly those over 45 years of age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 Daily Exercises That Restore Muscle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By weaving the following daily exercises into your routine, you can restore muscle quicker than using gym machines after the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="bodyweight-jump-squats" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Jump Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRfxI2Es2lE?si=ZUfWoh5d957UB_pl" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodyweight jump squats will build strength and endurance in your legs. They’ll also increase cardiovascular fitness, boost balance and coordination, and torch calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to explode up into a jump, reaching your arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower softly on the balls of your feet, bringing your arms back down and descending back into the squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause at the bottom for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 3 sets of 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="plank-to-pushups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank to Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56vUOad6Irs?si=XdTOiRGQn06Ycj20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move provides full-body strength, putting your chest, arms, shoulders, core and glutes to work. You will improve your stability, functional movement, and muscular endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a forearm plank: Place your forearms on the ground, elbows under your shoulders and arms parallel to your body, shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body straight from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core, legs, and glutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the plank for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the floor to complete a pushup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a long, straight body as you lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up, straightening your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 10 pushups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 3 sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="step-up-into-high-knee" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step-up Into High Knee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fURQlBUtTY?si=1AoLa_96IcRVkIJu" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This low-impact move will boost your lower-body strength, power, balance, and cardiovascular wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by standing tall, facing a sturdy workout bench, plyometric box, or step that’s about knee level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your left foot firmly onto the surface, keeping your core engaged and chest tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High knee raise with your opposite leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="sumo-squat-into-reverse-lunge-deadlift" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sumo Squat Into Reverse Lunge Deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCA8fAxDiYY?si=EYEKkwUpm2WRyRyW" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workout promotes solid lower-body strength, firing up the inner thighs, hamstrings, and glutes. Not only will it boost hip mobility, but it also increases balance and results in a strong physique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a wide sumo stance with your feet outside shoulder-width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower into a sumo squat, pressing your hips back and descending until your thighs are parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your left foot back into a reverse lunge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge forward from the hips to perform a deadlift with your back leg extending behind you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to rise back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your left foot forward to move into another sumo squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="hip-hinge" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hip Hinge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5WxMW-Fu5KU?si=00FwLsba_Uz8EHni" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hip hinge fires up the lower back, hamstrings, and glutes, which Nelson points out “are the first to weaken after menopause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees slightly and hold the weights in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your hips back as you lower the dumbbells down your leg. Maintain a straight back as you do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes to return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps, starting with light weights and increasing as you progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

At a molecular level, starch is made up of two glucose polymers: amylose and amylopectin.

After cooling or freezing and thawing, this might increase to 1 to 3%” said Zenker, as a reference point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Refrigerating And Freezing Bread Really Does to It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cooling is key to retrogradation, and storage temperature influences how much resistant starch forms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bread stored in the fridge actually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317765/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="develops more resistant starch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317765/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;develops more resistant starch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than bread at room temperature or frozen, but the trade-off is that it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122535/records/65df4ed90f3e94b9e5d73a52" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="goes stale faster" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122535/records/65df4ed90f3e94b9e5d73a52" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;goes stale faster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While freezing may cause slower formation of resistant starch, it’s typically recommended to preserve its quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Storage affects the texture, too. “For refrigeration, the texture ends up being drier as the cooler temperature and circulation of the fridge dehydrates the product unless tightly sealed when cooled,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chau-time.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brian Chau" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.chau-time.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian Chau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, principal food scientist at Chau Time. An easy fix is to add a bit of water when reheating, whether you’re toasting it or warming it in the oven or on the stovetop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing, on the other hand, makes bread more rigid. “When thawing frozen foods, the cell structures rupture from the ice formation,” Chau said. “This can further rearrange the starch alignment to create a different and possibly more resistant structure of starches&lt;span&gt; in the food.” While freezing may alter the structure in this way, the total amount of resistant starch formed is generally higher in bread stored in the fridge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Health Benefits Of Resistant Starch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These temperature changes affect digestion — fresh bread produces a higher glycemic response than refrigerated or frozen. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that toasting bread after freezing and defrosting lowered glucose response even further, likely because the freeze–toast–cool cycle creates multiple heat-and-cool phases that favor resistant starch formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because resistant starch isn’t absorbed into the bloodstream, it has little effect on blood sugar, making it helpful for people with insulin resistance, including Type 2 diabetes. “Resistant starch slows the absorption of other carbohydrates into the blood,” Zenker explained. “Because less of the carbohydrates in the food are absorbed, the impact on blood sugar is more blunted, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;reducing blood glucose and insulin spikes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This supports steady energy throughout the day, helps prevent sugar crashes and promotes feelings of fullness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond impacting blood sugar, resistant starch supports gut health, as it reaches the colon intact, where it feeds gut bacteria. “[Gut bacteria] consume resistant starch and release beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate,” Zenker said. Butyrate fuels healthy colon cells, reduces inflammation, and even influences brain health via the gut–brain axis. SCFAs also help maintain the intestinal lining, lowering the risk of what’s commonly referred to as “leaky gut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s also emerging evidence that resistant starch may aid feelings of fullness. “Indirectly, resistant starch may impact satiety and blood sugar by increasing GLP-1 production in the gut,” Zenker explained. SCFAs stimulate colon cells to produce GLP-1, a hormone that signals fullness to the brain. This is the same pathway targeted by popular GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic. While boosting GLP-1 naturally may help reduce hunger and cravings, Zenker notes that more research is needed to fully understand the impact of resistant starch on GLP-1 and satiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Javier Zayas Photography via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Javier Zayas Photography via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Toasting your bread after freezing it can significantly lower glycemic responses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Starch Trick Works On More Than Just Bread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond bread, starchy foods like rice, pasta and potatoes also gain resistant starch when cooked and cooled. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41387-022-00196-1" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41387-022-00196-1" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that cooled and reheated rice led to a 30% lower rise in blood glucose compared with freshly cooked rice. “It’s important to note that the benefit of resistant starch is small, so moderate portions still matter,” Zenker said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like bread, storage plays a role in balancing resistant starch formation and texture. “I typically recommend storing foods like potatoes in the fridge for up to three days because freezing can make them unpleasant,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gutfriendlynutrition.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sarah Glinski" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gutfriendlynutrition.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah Glinski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Canadian registered dietitian specializing in gut health. For rice and pasta, she advises choosing storage based on when you’ll eat them: refrigeration works for up to three days, while freezing is best for longer-term storage — up to three months — before texture starts to suffer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Meaningful Is The Difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="small 2008 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;small 2008 study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; looked at how freezing and toasting white bread affects blood sugar. The study found that compared with fresh, homemade white bread, bread that had been frozen and then thawed (or toasted after freezing and thawing) triggered significantly lower glycemic responses, by up to 39%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For people with diabetes or prediabetes, this could help with blood sugar management,” Glinski said. “Many people with these conditions have been advised to avoid carbohydrates, but this is usually unnecessary. Eating foods high in fiber, like resistant starch, can be a way to enjoy carbohydrates without them impacting your blood sugars as much.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Pick Bread That Supports Your Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond storage, the key to healthy bread is what’s inside the loaf and how much you eat. “I typically recommend people choose whole wheat bread or sprouted grain bread, which is naturally higher in fiber,” Glinski said. Breads with seeds like chia, flax and sunflower are also good sources, aiming for at least 3 grams per slice. “For healthy blood sugar levels, choose bread with less than 3 grams of sugar per slice, and check the ingredient list for cane sugar, honey, molasses or brown rice syrup,” Glinski added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who need to limit fermentable carbs (FODMAPs), sourdough can be a good option, as it generally has lower FODMAP content and may be gentler on digestion. Ultimately, portion size and what’s in your bread still play a big role in making each slice healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPQlhZdTRNOVNRTXBJZ3huVkpFa21jT2RmRWpmbC1rN0FpUUthaVZyT1dXNGxpOVlzdGVKTkYyY1BLVk5uS3ZLV0N3LTEtRUJCOWtQWkY3NU9ZX2xQRDlBb0FIRnlheWRZcTA5a0xEeXhqVlBscmpyaENKTVpfWW9JSmhYVjhDNXBmMVFrSTNfeGRnRWFaTzJhRkRGRdIBoAFBVV95cUxNeFVvcEE4LWhQTjFSWEJla0ZMel9MUGxXNUdCS3VXaGd1NlZSQXpMaGRlZTNNcXc2MDdoWTNrRnFIVEExRGFiME5SaXJ2TUJYNlFCbThUNGc2MTZfRURiVkpUajhjYkluNEhQSWg3V0NOekFiRk5hN0oyU3c1ZEJleWZBSHNDTjgxQzFCSzliOVFWM0xDMHQ1bDRkNC1OVHhl</guid></item><item><title>1个被低估的技能父母需要开始教他们的儿子- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boys-anger-goog_l_696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was having my first boy five years ago, I was elated and excited ... and then worried about anger. There had recently been yet another school shooting, followed by yet another rash of headlines about boys, guns and rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the roots of that kind of violence are deeply complex, and that in my own life I am surrounded by loving, empathetic men. But I was also a hormonal soon-to-be first-time mom (who, in hindsight, was probably grappling with a touch of perinatal anxiety). I worried that I would raise an angry young man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not alone. Concerns about boys and anger abound, as comedian and writer Michael Ian Black captured in his viral 2018 New York Times opinion piece “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/boys-violence-shootings-guns.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Boys Are Not All Right" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/boys-violence-shootings-guns.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;The Boys Are Not All Right&lt;/a&gt;.” “The man who feels lost but wishes to preserve his fully masculine self has only two choices: withdrawal or rage,” he wrote. The story has more than 2,100 comments. Clearly it struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I know my boys and have spent years watching their beautiful, complex little personalities unfold, those fears I held during my pregnancy seem distant and reductive. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; they do not inherently struggle with anger simply because they are boys. And yet they do lash out — sometimes in frustration, sometimes when I ask them to do something they don’t want to. What I want is to help them navigate that anger, so they can experience the feeling, but not be overwhelmed by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents need to give their children the tools to understand their feelings, and it needs to be developed just like developing understanding of other complicated and abstract concepts,” said Steven Meyers, a professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, first and foremost, it helps to understand the basics of what anger is: basically, a response to a perceived threat. The body releases adrenaline (the hormone that plays a key role in the fight-or-flight response) and the heart rate and blood pressure go up. It is absolutely fine — and sometimes really positive — to feel angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s when that anger is not managed in a healthy way that it can become problematic. So here are some tips for parents to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, understand that there &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be differences in how boys and girls experience and express anger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is so much nuance when it comes to individuals, emotions — and how they express those emotions. It is not fair, nor accurate, to say that all boys experience anger one way, while all girls experience it another. And research shows it is a myth that boys and men experience anger more than girls and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet experts say there can be big broad-strokes distinctions parents might want to at least have in mind as they help guide their children through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists have a saying that boys externalize and girls internalize. This means that boys are more likely to take their anger and distress and direct it outward, where it can become verbal or physical aggression. On the other hand, girls are more likely to direct their anger and frustrations inward towards themselves, so it can become self-blame or even depression,” Meyers said. “Naturally, this is a simplification, but there are gender differences in the rates of these different disorders between girls and boys, as well as between women and men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help your child learn how to label his feelings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step to stress and anger management is to help your child identify what’s going on, and to empathize with it,” said Kelsey Torgerson Dunn, a social worker who runs a private counseling practice in St. Louis that focuses on anxiety counseling and anger management for children and teens. Young kids don’t always recognize what they’re experiencing. Heck, adults struggle to identify their root feelings a lot of the time. But if you don’t understand what the problem is — in this case, feelings of anger or frustration that might lead a child to act out — you can’t solve the problem. Labeling the feeling is so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a younger kid, that might mean explicitly describing their emotions — like, “your body looks like it’s feeling frustrated,” Dunn offered by way of example, or “it seems like you are feeling angry, because I told you ‘no.’” Don’t worry about being presumptuous or getting it wrong. Your kid might turn around and tell you that they’re not actually feeling angry, they’re feeling XYZ thing — and that’s totally fine. You’ve prompted them to identify what is going on internally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older kids and teens probably won’t respond all that well to those kinds of prompts, but they might still need some help identifying their feelings in the moment. So for them, labeling might sound something more like, “If I were in this situation, I’d probably feel pretty mad. Walk me through what’s going on for you,” Dunn recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“One sentence that I often use when working with boys is that ‘you can feel whatever you want to feel, but you can’t always do whatever you want to do.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Steven Meyers, psychologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be soothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although parents might react to a child’s anger or outburst by walking away (and strategic ignoring &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/managing-problem-behavior-at-home/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can certainly be one way" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://childmind.org/article/managing-problem-behavior-at-home/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;can certainly be one way&lt;/a&gt; to help diffuse tantrums), experts say there is a strong argument to be made for soothing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anger can overwhelm young children. They do not necessarily have the ability to calm themselves down so that they become more reasonable,” Meyers said. “There are many ways to soothe and comfort an angry young child, but it may require a shift in the parent’s mindset or focus in the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be patient and calm. Make it clear that you’re not looking to just stifle or deny their anger in the moment — which is especially important with boys, who have historically been taught to bottle up their emotions. The goal is ultimately to help your kids get to a point where they’re able to self-soothe, perhaps by taking deep breaths, walking away or taking a few moments to themselves to calm down. By acting calm and soothing in the moment yourself, you’re modeling compassion for oneself and for others, which is a very good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse being soothing with being permissive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consequences are needed when anger spills over into aggression, especially as boys get older,” Meyers said. “One sentence that I often use when working with boys is that ‘you can feel whatever you want to feel, but you can’t always do whatever you want to do.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequences can take many different forms, depending on how old your child is, what the specific circumstances are, and what his personality responds to — and, of course, those things can change by the day. But things like brief time-outs or loss of privileges can be powerful tools in teaching boys that there is a difference between emotions and behaviors. Spend a bit of time thinking about the types of consequences you’re comfortable with, so that you’re not blurting out random threats after your child has expressed their anger in a way you’re not comfortable with. Certain strategies work better for some children than others, so you might need to recalibrate and try out a few things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, what you’re trying to teach is that it is absolutely OK to feel angry and to express that you are feeling angry. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; OK to act out on that anger in an aggressive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re worried about your child’s anger, ask for help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists use the standards of frequency, duration, intensity, and age-appropriateness when they assess whether a behavior is a symptom of a disorder,” said Meyers, so those are criteria parents who are concerned about their son’s anger or aggression should pay attention to. There aren’t hard and fast rules about what’s typical and what’s not, but if your son seems to be struggling with anger on a daily basis, that might be a sign something more serious is going on, Meyers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn said it’s also helpful to consider whether certain behaviors — like aggression — are happening across settings, such as if your child is having similar problems at home &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; at school. That kind of consistency signals that it is less about the particular situation in which they find themselves, and more about their general response to feelings of anger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned, experts say talking to your child’s pediatrician is a good place to start, and checking in with his teachers can also be helpful. It might take some digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents don’t always know what is going on underneath their sons’ anger. There might be stress, or anxiety, or depression,” Dunn said. “It’s important to find out what it might be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5JbHRaaGlQRm9ocWR1Mkp6M2U0c1FueEFlVUJmRGpuUTRHYmJldElTX05OUjl6LWhWVTJOd1RGUmRDNjhON05BUXkzVm5SMzBtYUNJNGxOaVYwN18tY3pwSlVVdmEzRE1HSmNjQjNvYjZ5NVNUZU5McVpUNzZlQdIBgwFBVV95cUxQaHVYRjJuQjNiVENPWWlFcWtNSmRZdlM2RDdsVXFYU3RnUmYyLUVON0dNMEc4cjVWVFBEQ0ZMY3FlMHU4b2Y4cVZHSUhHcEdwYUpSQ2J1Q2NILUJOZXVMWTJZd3NyZTgtMFhLbEpOTHl1X1lMRFZNUGZUVXRSMDFCMEREQQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
