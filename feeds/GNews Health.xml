Another Reddit post showed a similar digital billboard being towed across the water, also just off the Florida coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's not just beaches, either. Whether you're stuck in traffic, pumping gas, or just going to school, you could now potentially be inundated with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, money spent on advertising in the United States increased 5.6% over 2023 to an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethannkaminkow/2024/04/21/as-ad-spend-rises-marketing-budgets-switch-to-commerce/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$360 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$360 billion&lt;/a&gt; — and that doesn't even include political advertising. All that comes with a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Advertising pushes an overall culture of consumerism, where people strive to get the best and latest products. Companies, in turn, create more and more products to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-manufacturer-carbon-emissions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manufacturing and production sector;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;manufacturing and production sector&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for roughly 20% of global carbon pollution, and more than half of the world's energy usage. It also contributes greatly to the trillions of pieces of plastic that pollute our planet and waterways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Purpose Disruptors, a London-based organization dedicated to advertising, created a metric called "&lt;a href="https://www.purposedisruptors.org/advertised-emissions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advertised emissions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;advertised emissions&lt;/a&gt;", which measures the carbon pollution that results from increased sales due to advertising. In 2022, its research found, the United Kingdom generated nearly 230 million tons of "advertised emissions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not surprisingly, consumerism isn't favored by many &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:r/Anticonsumption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;r/Anticonsumption&lt;/a&gt; posters, and this beach billboard drew considerable ire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I've heard of carrier pigeons," &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1mg7q2u/comment/n6p1zx7/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one commenter wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;one commenter wrote&lt;/a&gt;, "but this is too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?recW3q8XDvUSYnLYh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOQ01YT1hETGwyOFF2dlIydi03eTIwem1uTmFabFlQaDRubHViZ0J1bHV3MGs5aG45c3U0ZXBDM1NrZDBPWExUUS1LS0pIeThocVJ0eGdoSFVhNkJIeDdfMDJuVndjQy13NFBnN3d0NW80XzZOT3F2Vlh1N1hYWW5ZMkoydHo1Q2J0aDNBRDJ1UnBIT25mc0YwT1F3</guid></item><item><title>县官员称，在威克县高中发现活跃的肺结核病例- WRAL.com</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/active-tuberculosis-wake-county-high-school-sept-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was found at a Wake County high school, just several weeks into the new schoolyear, according to a Wake County spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County, in an email, told WRAL that they were notified that a person with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville High School sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county is working with the Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with the person. Those people will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We are working to find out how many people might have been affected by this case. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease that affects the lungs or other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys or spine. It is spread through the air when someone with TB coughs, sneezes, sings or speaks, according to county's website. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB is not spread by shaking hands, kissing, sharing glasses, plates, utensils, clothing, sheets or furniture. While TB can be spread when someone coughs or sneezes, it cannot be spread throughout the air outside. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB symptoms may include: &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a bad cough that lasts three weeks or longer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pain in the chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;coughing up blood, spit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness or fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weight loss, no appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;chills, fever, sweating at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The palace has said he is receiving treatment, but has not said what type of cancer he has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catherine announced her diagnosis in March 2024, and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2m8g2vp41o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;went into remission&lt;/a&gt; in January.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;With some states thinking about removing vaccine mandates, Maryland will protect access to vaccines for all of its residents with flu season approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland residents can go to their providers and pharmacies to get their vaccinations, and get advice on what types of vaccines to get to protect themselves from viruses and illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends to those 6 years and older to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes in the midst of the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/08/fda-approves-updated-pfizer-covid-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration approving updated COVID-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which is limited for some kids and adults with one high-risk health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The federal government’s rapid changes and unnecessary swirl around vaccine policy is harmful for Marylanders and all Americans, and could result in disastrous public health outcomes,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore added that the state is prepared to deal with the challenges of federal vaccine guidance with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. trying to advance anti-vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He signed a law in 2024 that would allow pharmacists to give those 3 years and over COVID-19 and flu vaccine without a prescription, a release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health, safety and well-being of Marylanders and their loved ones are our North Star, and we will do everything in our power to ensure they have access to life-saving medicines like vaccines,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts is following Maryland’s playbook in protecting &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/states-move-to-protect-vaccines-in-the-face-of-attempts-to-remove-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccine access for its residents&lt;/a&gt;, despite Florida being on the verge of being the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/florida-will-work-to-eliminate-all-childhood-vaccine-mandates-in-the-state-officials-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first state to to get rid of school vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 8 in 10 U.S. adults said kids should be vaccinated to go to school, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/what-polls-show-about-americans-views-on-childhood-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a Harvard/SSRS poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines continue to be one of the most powerful public health tools for safeguarding our people and communities against disease,” Maryland Department of Health Secretary Dr. Meena Seshamani said.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say the problem is related to a lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reality was never clearer than Thursday at the Denver Public Library, where &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-denver-health-exhibit-aims-to-break-addiction-stigma-during-national-recovery-month" target="_blank"&gt;an exhibit aimed at breaking substance use stigma&lt;/a&gt; became the setting for a life-saving rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the customers of the library came and was talking to some of our staff, and then sat down in the library and fell asleep, but we heard some snoring, and people were checking in on him,” said Brooke Bender, administrative director at Denver Health’s Center for Addiction Medicine. “Eventually, we didn't hear anything else, and the library social worker had stopped by to check on him. They seemed to have known him, that he was a regular visitor of the library.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man became unresponsive, Bender and peer-support specialists acted quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She couldn't get him to respond, and so we jumped into action, and we had the naloxone there at the table as part of our booth, and grabbed that and were able to bring him back,” Bender said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, library staff called 911, and Denver Health paramedics rushed the man to the emergency department, where he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saved his life. It was a surprising event that we didn't expect to happen when we were there, sharing pictures and stories of people in recovery,” Bender said. “But it was a powerful reminder that what we're doing really matters, and that this can happen anywhere at any time, and that all of us can be responsible for saving a life if we have naloxone at our fingertips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bender, the lesson is simple: “Having naloxone with you, even if you don't use substances yourself, gives you the opportunity to support someone else who might need that help. There should be no stigma about taking naloxone whenever you have the opportunity, so that you can carry it and save a life if you need to, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How naloxone works and why community access matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is simple to use and does not require medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You do not need to be a medical professional to use this,” Bender said. “Many of the people that we've talked to in the community this week, when we were sharing our 'Stories in Black and White' exhibit, said that they've saved several of their friends and family's lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using naloxone is very straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Naloxone comes in an easy-to-open package. If you just tear off the packaging, there's no cover for the nasal spray. I just took the nasal spray and took it to the person's nose when they're lying down, and put it in one of their nostrils and squeezed,” she explained. “We wait for two to three minutes to see if that's taken effect, if there's any response, if the heart's beating, and check for signs of stability, and if there are none, then you take another dose and put it in the other nostril and spray.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Denver Health created a video demonstrating how to administer naloxone. You can watch it in the video player below&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="HtmlModule"&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDQ4cbItN3s?si=wujx880sqRuAoyTo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bender, expired naloxone can still work and should not be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Expired naloxone can still work and should be used. We should not be throwing away expired naloxone that can still save someone's life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking down barriers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2025.00263" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety&lt;/a&gt; highlights ongoing disparities in naloxone access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study looked at the different steps it takes to go from someone becoming aware that naloxone is a thing, that it can help, to them having it on their person when it would be necessary,” said Dr. Joshua Black, senior statistical research scientist. “The main takeaway is that the disparity persists. Disparities have to be addressed all along that pathway in various ways that we can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black said cultural context is key to outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We cited some other research in our study showing that with Hispanic groups, just taking something that was written for English and translating it to Spanish isn't enough, because the way that things are said needs to be culturally meaningful to that group,” he said. “Engaging with individuals who are part of the community, who are peers, would enable whatever is developed to resonate more effectively with that community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, stigma remains a major obstacle, not only in seeking help but in carrying naloxone. Black argues for new distribution strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So moving out of a healthcare out of a retail setting and having harm reduction present where people are, rather than having them come to where the medicine is, would be another way to get over the stigma," Black said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A message of preparedness and hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Bender and Denver Health, the work goes well beyond emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's important to just be prepared and to really know how to use it and be prepared to use it,” Bender said. “In a crisis, it can feel a little jarring, and so it's good to have some repetitive practice… all those steps over and over, just to have it fresh in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of peer support is also clear, especially for those experiencing these situations for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This just goes to show the value of people who have lived expertise and the role that they can play in helping folks that may not have experience with that know what to do in that situation,” Bender said. “We know these things are working, and we just need to expand access."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextModule"&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 332 to 478 calories, while the lunches span 379 to 596 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_127-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is found in every cell in our body. Because of this, it’s essential for countless bodily functions like bone and muscle health, digestion and energy production. While most people get enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-protein-11790921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, certain factors like activity level, age or health goals may amp up your needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_128-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_129-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the flip side, diets that are too high in protein can sometimes lack fiber, which may lead to digestive troubles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Striking the right balance of both protein and fiber is key to keeping your body healthy and running smoothly. Fiber brings its own powerful set of benefits. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to healthier weight loss and long-term weight control, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, reduced odds of certain cancers, more regular bowel movements and even a longer life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_130-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_131-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together, protein and fiber help you feel full and satisfied after meals, support digestion and keep your energy steady throughout the day. Talk about a winning combo for health and well-being!

Five states reported local cases of animal and human bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease begins with "absent or mild and non-specific symptoms" like fevers, headaches, enlarged glands, muscle pain, and chest pain as the parasites flow through the bloodstream, per the&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; World Health Organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, early symptoms could include "purplish swelling of the lids of one eye" or a skin lesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms get much more intense the longer the parasites remain in the body, largely collecting in the heart and digestive muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One to three decades after infection, up to a third of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 1 in 10 suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations," the website read. "In later years these patients may experience the damage to the nervous system and muscles of the heart and digestive system, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, progressive heart failure, and sudden death, among other clinical manifestations and complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is treatable, but is much more effective in the early stages of infection. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" target="_blank" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the disease may become untreatable if it becomes chronic, at which point the only option is treating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 18:44:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgJBVV95cUxQTE9vaWt6NE9CekVVOE4xLXdzSk85OHhoWFlvU0ZSZlNtZGNpQ0VubHplWm5uenNSTVltUmJSV3dvRVFVQ0ZCSElzWkZCdzlmT0FsQkZrNzlQRDFvS3FwMHZPSWFGeEpUMXA0RnNaMDFNX2tRaHV2a013NW5ydVc5VDZoc3N1Vm5hWFExZzdvVm1lUUFPNWFzOS1KQXRWLVUxenpERW4xV2hOVWJJaURoNmE1eXptbWRTN0pCbUdPbVljaExRb3VPRFUyMjFtemdfZzBDaDBudEVGdGVfN1lUV0tEbmpPVG9EMmthdnJRSjBONkhoWVR2NXpSM3ZsTlRlemZ0T2tDWmdITldmcUJkV0hNS195VjBZUUlNMjV6Y3Z0SUk4ZXM0YmVONTcwVE90OG8xSXpiTjI4THNYZkxESzg0cnRfSDAwRFBaVTJR</guid></item><item><title>如果您使用人工智能进行治疗，以下是专家推荐的5件事-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/06/ai-chatbots-therapy-tips/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JOLKNZK2FFHTJHJUGLV4KGUPPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many people are turning to generative artificial intelligence for answers to work or school questions.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-protein snacks like strained (Greek-style) yogurt help you stay full between meals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein supports metabolism by preserving muscle and boosting calorie burn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose yogurt low in sugar and saturated fat, and add fiber-rich fruit or nuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is everywhere these days. From bars to shakes to cereal, it seems every product is fortified with it. But not all protein-rich snacks are created equal. Some offer solid nutrition, while others come with extra ingredients that can work against your health goals—especially if weight loss is one of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what’s the best pick? We asked dietitians to share the No. 1 high-protein snack for weight loss. Their answer: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-it-so-effective"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes It So Effective &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one 6-ounce container of plain, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-ingredient-for-high-protein-vegetarian-meals-8649419" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonfat strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; packs 18 grams of high-quality protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This substantial amount of protein promotes feelings of fullness, reducing the likelihood of overeating later in the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Protein works in several ways to help you lose weight. First, it increases satiety, or how full you feel when you eat. But that’s only the beginning. Protein requires lots of energy to digest and absorb. So, your body burns more calories to process protein-rich foods than carbohydrates or fats. Last but not least, protein also helps maintain calorie-burning muscle for a faster metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there’s more. Strained (Greek-style) yogurt also contains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053111/can-probiotics-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, live bacteria that support your gut and have also been linked to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it boasts a robust nutrient profile (hello, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strained (Greek-style) yogurt is great for weight loss on its own. However, for an even more satisfying snack, dietitians recommend pairing it with fresh fruit and a healthy fat, like chopped nuts, seeds or a drizzle of nut butter. Try mixing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261071/yogurt-with-blueberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;yogurt with blueberries&lt;/a&gt; as an excellent base. Or, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252990/homemade-plain-greek-yogurt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;make your own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-shopping-tips"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Shopping Tips &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s certainly no shortage of options when it comes to strained (Greek-style) yogurt. However, nutrients can vary from brand to brand. Here’s what to look for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High in protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose brands that pack 16 grams or more of high-quality protein, says &lt;a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Rodriguez, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low or no added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Rodriguez recommends opting for a plain variety. However, if you’re an “on the fence” yogurt connoisseur, there are many brands with very low added sugar that may suit your taste. Stick to those with no more than 5 g of added sugar or less. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;These are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good-for-your-gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. For the best bang, look for &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;. Research reveals they may specifically help with weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll find them listed on the ingredient list. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little saturated fat: &lt;/strong&gt;Like protein, all fats aren’t created equally. For optimal heart health, the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting saturated fat to a maximum of 10% of total calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rodriguez suggests choosing a brand that contains no more than 0.5 g of saturated fat per serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-weight-loss-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Weight Loss Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Snacks that support weight loss should mimic the same composition as meals that support weight loss,” says Rodriguez. “They should be anchored with high-quality protein and rounded out with a naturally fibrous food and heart-healthy (plant-based) fat.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few other rules of thumb that can make your high-protein weight-loss snack work even harder for you:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; fills you up, so it may help you eat less.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, add some fiber-rich berries, pears or any of these other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-8639024" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; to your yogurt or smoothie. They’re also a great way to add natural sweetness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean on healthy fats: &lt;/strong&gt;Fat is digested slowly, so it keeps you fuller for longer. Think &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-healthy-fats-for-weight-loss-8417296" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; from mix-ins like nuts, seeds, nut butters and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8057914/avocado-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be choosy about allergy-friendly alternatives: &lt;/strong&gt;If dairy allergies are an issue, there are protein-rich plant-based strained (Greek-style) yogurt alternatives. Look for brands with at least 10 g of protein per serving. Just be cautious of the fat content, specifically saturated fat, which hangs out in coconut yogurt. Instead, opt for soy or oat-based yogurts fortified with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt;, like pea or soy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Try These High-Protein Snacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When weight loss is a goal, high-protein snacks can help you stay full and satisfied, especially strained (Greek-style) yogurt. It’s the top dietitian-approved high-protein snack to help you lose weight. Need help sifting through the plethora of options on store shelves? Look for one that’s low in saturated fat and added sugars. Or choose plain, unsweetened strained (Greek-style) yogurt and add your own healthy mix-ins like high-fiber fruits and a healthy fat, like chopped nuts.

The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth, as in Crews's case, but for some people, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood, when a child's growth is not as expected for their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both her parents and two siblings are of average height, and like around 80 percent of children with achondroplasia, Crews inherited the condition due to a mutation in the FGFR3 gene that occurred at the time of conception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up with achondroplasia was extremely difficult, Crews says, and she remembers her mother constantly fearing for her life as the condition can cause sudden death syndrome due to brainstem compression and dangerous breathing problems like sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her childhood was marred by frequent trips to hospitals for treatments and to meet with various specialists as dwarfism can cause complications, including bowed legs, spinal curvature, ear infections and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews also remembers feeling like a 'show dog' because of her small stature, and people would frequently come up to her to pat her head and give her 'fake' compliments to make her feel better, which she said left her feeling confused and angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was when she turned 16 and realized she would never grow any taller that Crews decided to undergo 'taboo' limb lengthening surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Chandler Crews underwent three limb-lengthening procedures. Left, at her mature adult height of 3'10' and, right, at the end of her treatments, standing just over 4'11″ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening is controversial in the dwarfism community because it's a painful, expensive, and risky procedure with a high complication rate, and some believe it promotes the idea that short stature is a defect to be 'fixed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on her website, Crews said: 'I felt like I was never in my own body. I felt like my energy was wasting time in the body it wasn't meant to be in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to wait for the world to change to fit my needs; I wanted to take charge and change for myself and no one else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've noticed within the dwarfism community, some may feel that when someone else with dwarfism changes or alters their own body, that it's an insult to everyone with that 'body type.' But it's not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just like everyone else in the world, our bodies are our own, and no one, even if you have the same diagnosis as them, should have any say in what you do or don't do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2010, when she was 16 years old, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the thigh or shin bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod) to slowly pull the bone segments apart over several weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bones are extended by around 1 millimeter per day, and during the 'distraction phase,' new bone forms in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the desired length is reached, the device is removed, and the new bone is left to fuse back together before the individual can regain full mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no precise, readily available national figures on the total number of limb lengthening surgeries performed annually in the US, but the procedure is performed for both dwarfism-related and cosmetic reasons, with cosmetic height-lengthening procedures increasing in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crews estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are fewer than 50,000 people with achondroplasia in the US. The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her spine health, she was able to have them mostly paid for by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bow legs, also known as genu varum, is a condition where the knees curve outward, causing a gap between them when the feet are together. Left untreated, the long-term consequences of bowed legs in adults can include chronic joint pain, progressive arthritis, instability, and restricted mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews described the limb lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The initial post-surgery recovery from her first surgery consisted of two to three hours of personal training sessions five days a week and daily exercises and stretches, which she did in her own time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Crews' bones were in the right position for the fixators to be removed from her first leg lengthening surgery, it was April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'After removal, I had one month of no weight-bearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was cleared to fully weight-bear, I did have to re-learn how to walk, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used a walker for about two weeks, then two quad canes for about a week, then down to one. By June, I was walking unassisted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In August 2010, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures. Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crews described her first leg lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After starting the process to get her legs lengthened, Crews also went about getting her arms lengthened so they would be in proportion with the rest of her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says people with dwarfism who opt to do leg lengthening usually opt to get their arms done too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting this procedure done, Crews points out, is important for a range of activities, from being able to drive a car to reaching into the refrigerator comfortably.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For her arm lengthening, Crews had fixators implanted in January 2012 when she was 17 years old and then removed the following August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said of the procedure: 'This time, I only had fixators on my humerus [the bone of the upper arm], which meant I was mobile [able to walk].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because you don't bear weight in your arms, the consolidation or fusing phase can be slower as weight-bearing tends to help bone consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As for the physical therapy, I did personal training two to three times a week. After removing my fixators, I had about a month of no heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The arm lengthening procedure saw Crews gain four inches in her arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews went in for a second and then third leg lengthening in May 2013 when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. The average height for a woman varies globally, but in the US, it is 5'3.5".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'In full transparency, I also wanted to be more able-bodied. It was not just about being taller but also more proportionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When it came to height (lengthening legs), I didn't want to rely on stepstools and other forms of assistance constantly. Yes, it was my 'norm,' but it never felt like independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having longer arms, I can now reach the top of my head (wash it easier, high ponytails, safely use hairstyling tools, etc.), sit a safer distance away from the steering wheel when driving, not have to alter sleeves, deal with feminine hygiene – changing tampons, wiping front-to-back, not needing to use a bidet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 4'11' I'm still really short, but I'm what I call (for myself) a "comfortable short."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crew estimates her procedures cost close to $2million.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is having a moment. Walk the aisles at a grocery store and you'll see row upon row of protein chips, protein muffins, protein cereal, even protein candy bars. Entire industries are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/well/youbar-protein-bar-lab.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;emerging&lt;/a&gt; around the creation and processing of these novelty products. Processed protein is big business, and Americans are buying it: In a recent &lt;a href="https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, over 70 percent of Americans said they tried to increase their protein intake this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But American diets aren’t actually short on protein. They're short on &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/Pdf/0910/Table_1_Nin_Gen_09.Pdf"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and vitamins and minerals that come not from any one macronutrient but from a variety of natural, whole foods—things with leaves and skins and seeds—instead of the ultra-processed foods that make up the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/well/eat/americans-are-eating-slightly-less-ultraprocessed-food-cdc-data-shows.html"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of the average American’s diet. Indeed, the disconnect between Americans’ desires and their ideal diets is such that the latest version of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-us-dietary-guidelines-come-before-august-kennedy-says-2025-05-14/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August, is &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-report-2025-11697882"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to emphasize the importance of protein—but from plant-based sources, over meat and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? A number of factors have contributed to the reign of protein as a health-food virtue-signal: the rise of Ozempic and doctors’ calls for GLP-1 drug users to eat more of it to keep up muscle tone, the influence of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and its skepticism of ultra-processed products over whole foods, and above all, consumers’ desire to marry health (or the appearance of it) with convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last factor is the reason why, despite what Kennedy’s dietary guidelines may advise, the rise of protein consciousness seems unlikely to move the needle on the nutrition-related health crises—overweight and obesity, heart disease, diabetes—that plague the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;majority of Americans&lt;/a&gt;. Protein alone can't make America healthy again, but it's an enticing shortcut that more consumers are taking with every processed protein product—and most of them are very, very processed—that hits the shelves. To be able to recognize all this junk in health-food clothing, one first has to understand Americans’ love affair with fast food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall seemed to be the inflection point for protein. In August, Kennedy yoked his MAHA movement to the Trump presidential campaign, giving health-consciousness—and skepticism of anything considered “unhealthy”—an energized platform beyond social media and the doctor’s office. The new class of weight-loss drugs—that is, Ozempic and its fellows—had also been approved by the FDA. By September the market was ripe for a new kind of convenience food, and that's when Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, &lt;a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/vital-pursuit-nationwide-glp-1"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new line of high-protein frozen meals targeted at weight-loss drug users. Grouped under the brand name Vital Pursuit, the meals are marketed as the perfect convenience food for newly health-conscious consumers: The cauliflower crust pepperoni pizza packs 22 grams of protein for under 400 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pizza tastes like a cardboard prototype of a pizza. Measuring just over six inches in diameter, made with that trendy cauliflower crust and topped with reduced-fat mozzarella cheese, it’s “air fryer ready . . . for added convenience.” The pie I unwrapped from its plastic boasted a grand total of four pepperoni, a shockingly orange sauce, and a nifty kind of topping formulation that popped off the crust in a single disk when accidentally knocked against the baking sheet. It is convenient, yes, but it does not look healthy. Nor does it taste that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did taste, however, much like every frozen pizza I’d eaten in my childhood: a monoflavor vaguely reminiscent of tomato, cheese, and flour—and strongly reminiscent of Friday nights, when my family and I ate frozen pizzas and watched Disney movies. This rush of nostalgia made me realize something that Nestlé knows well: When it comes to food, the important thing is how one feels about it. And if consumers now want to feel healthy while indulging in ultra-processed foods—well, just add protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a wolf in sheep’s clothing that Americans should recognize by now. While the term “junk food” has been around for a long time, figuring out what exactly is wrong with it is a recent, and quite popular, endeavor. Dieting took off in the late 1800s and ultra-processed foods began to appear early in the next century, but American obesity rates started rising at a steep rate in the 1970s as fast food and convenience meals—and the advertising of them—really took off. The theories about the reasons behind this nationwide weight gain are many, and many have a grain of truth: too few fruits and vegetables, sedentary lifestyles, poverty, food deserts. As the problem continues to worsen, people point fingers in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thread that unites all of these complex causes is the idea that Americans &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to lose weight—through diets, programs, drugs, apps, and more—and then they confront reality in the form of a fast-food sign. The idea that our diets are a problem really gripped the nation with the 2001 publication of Eric Schlosser’s hit book &lt;em&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/em&gt;, which argued that quintessential American restaurants aggressively marketed food that they knew was unhealthy—especially to children, to get them hooked for life. The investigative reporter Michael Moss expanded this idea to all processed food in a popular 2013 exposé, claiming that companies formulate their products to hit the “&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130401012639/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=4"&gt;bliss point&lt;/a&gt;”—that is, the irresistible combination of salt, sugar, and fat that keeps customers coming back for more, presumably forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before MAHA, then, Americans were hearing the claim that junk food was intrinsically addictive because of what’s in it. But as fast food companies responded to the backlash by &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sodium-still-high-in-fast-food-and-processed-foods-201305166267"&gt;promising to lower&lt;/a&gt; fat and salt content over the next few years, some researchers noticed something odd: Americans’ weight wasn’t decreasing, and neither was their consumption of fast and fatty foods—in fact, the opposite was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some researchers couldn’t help but wonder whether it wasn’t so much the ingredients of foods, but the way these ingredients were treated by food manufacturers. Chris van Tulleken’s 2023 book &lt;em&gt;Ultraprocessed People &lt;/em&gt;argued that the processing itself—the stripping or “refining” of flours, the “isolating” of proteins and “hydrolyzing” of fats—makes what was once food into something that the body can’t digest. He, along with many other medical professionals, claimed that eating ultra-processed food leads to diseases like those linked to obesity: Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome. And the food industry essentially regulates itself thanks to loopholes such as the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation, which essentially allows companies to self-determine whether a new ingredient is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to protein. By these criteria, Vital Pursuit pepperoni cauliflower crust protein pizza—and many of its fellow protein-packed processed foods—is simply a newer member of an older food category, one that is simultaneously “health food” and junk. Nestlé’s strategy seems based on the bet that consumers won’t see the contradiction here—and if they do, habit and nostalgia will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nestlé isn’t the only company that is trying to enter the protein-conscious era, nor is it the first. The protein-pumping trend appeared in nutrition and workout circles for years before weight loss drugs and MAHA took it fully mainstream. Core Power protein shakes, owned by Fairlife and distributed by Coca-Cola, launched in 2012 and in recent years has &lt;a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2023/05/06/fairlife-refuses-to-inflate-prices/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20very%20popular,at%20retailers%20across%20the%20country"&gt;inspired a mania&lt;/a&gt; reminiscent of the COVID toilet paper hoarding days. Predictably, Fairlife’s viral fame led to empty Costco shelves—and Fairlife is &lt;a href="https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/stories/coca-colas-fairlife-breaks-ground-on-major-production-facility-in-ny,1187#:~:text=This%20expansion%20follows%20the%20construction,growing%20demand%20for%20fairlife%20products."&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; new facilities to ramp up production, while members of weight loss drug support groups on social media continue to tout them as a “healthy” meal replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Nestlé pizzas, though, the list of ingredients on a Core Power shake includes plenty of evidence of processing. The natural sugar and fat in the milk is replaced with plant-based additives that imitate the texture and flavor of a sugary milkshake, in a way that makes the nutrition label look “healthier.” Core Power shakes use the thickening agent carrageenan to give that impression of milky creaminess, the emulsifier cellulose gel to replace fat, and cellulose gum for texture and consistency. The shakes’ sweetness comes from a mix of the “natural” plant-based sweeteners Stevia and monkfruit, along with the artificial sweeteners acesulfame potassium and sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the type of protein itself in these “healthy” products. Fairlife protein shakes use ultra-filtered milk, which is processed to increase protein content and reduce lactose, the natural sugar in dairy products. But some “healthy” products use even more highly processed, and questionable, sources of protein. One popular type of protein bar (among the infinite profusion of options) for those on weight loss drugs, according to an informal survey of posts in a Facebook support group, is made by Barebells. It’s a Swedish company that launched in 2016—and is notably not owned by a mega-food corporation—that offers the full range of imitation dessert flavors from cookie dough to caramel chocolate to key lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barebells uses a “milk protein blend” that includes calcium caseinate and whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, whey protein isolate. Behind all these terms is, again, lots of processing: Whey protein can be packaged into any flavor of protein bar one can dream of. Soy often appears on nutrition labels as an “isolate,” which is blasted with chemicals to “purify” it for easy use in all sorts of protein boosters, from pizza to those muscled-up pseudo-Pop-Tarts in checkout aisles from GNC to CVS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, a food company adding protein to a nutritionally empty product is better than nothing. But despite what the protein craze suggests, pumped-up protein does not put consumers on the fast-track to health. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;nutritionists&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly warning that overloading on protein can backfire: The body can only make use of a certain amount of protein for energy before the body starts storing it as fat, and overdoses of certain amino acids, which combine to form proteins, can &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/protein-food-industry-trend-nutrition-8a2cf27b?st=v91RFw"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to cardiovascular disease. And for weight-loss drug users, the drugs’ appetite-suppressing effects actually mean that consuming a variety of foods matters even more in order to get necessary nutrients with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching nutrients to cut calorie, carb, and fat counts doesn’t seem to magically create healthy food, despite food companies’ claims to the contrary. But when criticisms arise, the ultra-processed food industry’s go-to tactic consists of “reformulation”: changing recipes by using different materials such as starches or flavorings to provide the “same great taste!” W.K. Kellogg Co. followed this strategy after the U.K.’s High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) regulations went into effect in 2022, placing limits on how and where foods high in these common markers of junk food could be marketed. In response, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Article/2023/06/07/kellogg-s-expands-non-hfss-coco-pops-range#"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; an additional, “non-HFSS” version of its most popular offering among children, Coco Pops, with marginally lower sugar content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode shows that regulation can certainly be done. But it can also blur the already gray line between what’s healthy and what’s not. After all, the non-HFSS Coco Pops are by law a healthy choice now—something even the most ambitious cereal marketer would have had a hard time convincing even the most persuadable mother about before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with Kennedy asking food companies to make a “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-applauds-dairy-industry-voluntary-commitment-food-dyes.html"&gt;voluntary, protective pledge&lt;/a&gt;” to remove additives such as food dyes from their products, this dynamic could well play out in the United States, in ways that could blur the lines of healthy food even more—and reinforce old habits. After all, no matter how many people are on Ozempic, Americans aren’t going to stop eating nachos during the Super Bowl. Food marketers know well the power of nostalgia in determining what consumers will crave: The Coco Pops you ate for breakfast or the Doritos you ate while watching football as a kid might be what you crave now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the magic of modern food processing is that both cereal and chips can be adapted, at least on their face, to nutritional requirements. This ambiguity favors large food companies, which have far greater resources to make over their established brands than an organic farmer does. And that’s not even counting the time it takes for scientists and regulators to catch up. Travis Masterson, who directs the Health, Ingestive Behavior, and Technology lab at Penn State, described watching Nestlé and other food companies respond to the rise of the new weight loss drugs from inside the scientific community: “Those companies are doing massive amounts of market research on their consumers all the time,” he said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“If as scientists we're starting to look at the changes in diet, they're light years ahead of us on that because they can do things faster and easier than we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Kennedy may be behind the times in the fight to Make America Healthy Again through &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf"&gt;cutting ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. In the age of Ozempic and MAHA, the centrality of ultra-processed food to Americans’ diet seems less under threat than undergoing a new stage of evolution—a protein-packed one. We say we want to eat better, but what we really want is to feel better about eating. And food companies, unbridled by any powerful regulation, are primed to give us what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

Dalgleish’s beliefs have been repeatedly debunked among the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last month, Malhotra told the Daily Beast that RFK Jr. and Trump—having already made the COVID mRNA vaccine available only to the medically vulnerable and over-65s—were planning to pull it off the market altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra says there are people within the Trump administration, as well as among Trump’s family, who agree with RFK Jr. that there are so-called “injuries” caused by the vaccine. Kennedy and the Trump associates do not have any medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Days after the Daily Beast revealed plans to pull the vaccine, a wave of CDC departures occurred over Kennedy’s vaccine policy. Trump then publicly called on drug companies to prove that their COVID jabs worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Daily Beast approached Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the HHS, and Dalgliesh for comment. Dalgliesh said: “[While] we do not know that Charles and Kate’s unexpected cancers were caused by the vaccines, as they both presented with benign conditions… it is highly likely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “This individual is not a member of the Administration, and does not represent the Administration’s thinking or planning. The Daily Beast should expend its obviously limited capabilities on trying to accurately cover the people who actually can speak on behalf of the Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 12:56:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPbWFrOUpMLVRRWXRUeTBlVmdzd3F6M3k1dkpNQjZoSks3ZnR0b2ZGOEhNaWNkWWdvaG1id3dBYXBuQlFrMUNKTGE4aWpZSlRidFRlRWdzSmRyQ3kwd3lUNlUzeWNLSDhTS3RDejduVXdtVU5kUkxORWN5WmxWNE1tVDZEcHo</guid></item><item><title>卡通：医疗急救-科斯日报</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/6/2341863/-Cartoon-Medical-emergency</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__details"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Jonny Terrell was a healthy, happy baby — but a month before his first birthday, he came down with an infection. Days later, he was vomiting. Over the next few weeks, mom Emily Robichau took him to the doctor for ear infections, stomachaches, rashes, vomiting, diarrhea and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The list was so long I couldn't remember it all," Robichau recalled. She had three older children and knew that kids got sick. But she had never seen anything like the constant stream of ailments her 11-month-old was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after Jonny's first birthday, in August 2024, his stomach swelled, "like watching a balloon fully inflate," Robichau said. The next day was his one-year checkup. Jonny's pediatrician took one look at him and sent them to Massachusetts General Hospital for Children. When Robichau and Jonny arrived, the toddler underwent CT and MRI scans that found a mass "about the size of a grapefruit" in his liver. A biopsy of the mass found that he had a rare and aggressive cancer called malignant rhabdoid tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she and her fiancé, Michael Terrell, began "looking at urns" as they learned more about the condition.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctors were telling me the statistics and how bad they were, and to hope for the best, but kind of prepare for the worst," Robichau recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is malignant rhabdoid tumor? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumor is a rare tumor, most often seen in infants and toddlers, said Dr. Michael Ortiz, a pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the clinical director of the rare tumors program at MSK Kids, the center's pediatric arm. Ortiz was not involved in Jonny's care. Just 20 to 25 patients are diagnosed with the illness each year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/malignant-rhabdoid-tumor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Boston Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumors can "show up anywhere" in the body's soft tissues, but "have a predilection for the brain and kidney," Ortiz said. The tumors also have a "high propensity to metastasize," or spread, throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumors are "one of the worst prognostic tumors we have in pediatrics," Ortiz said. Only about one in 10 children with the diagnosis will be cured, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating malignant rhabdoid tumor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Jonny, his case was a rare example where the tumor had not spread, said Dr. Lauren Boal, a pediatric oncologist and hematologist at Massachusetts General. She and Dr. Danielle Cameron, a pediatric surgeon with a focus on tumors like this, developed a complex treatment plan for Jonny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease really doesn't have an absolute regimen. You have to carve out an individualized plan," Boal said. For Jonny, that meant a course of six chemotherapy agents. He responded well, though he suffered unpleasant side effects from the powerful medications, Boal said, and needed a feeding tube to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, Robichau and Jonny lived in housing across the street from the hospital. It was stressful to live apart from the rest of the family, but Jonny's rigid treatment plan and its side effects made it necessary to stay close. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We all experienced the same trauma in different ways," Robichau said. "I feel like I just went on autopilot. It was lonely, it was quiet. It just had us overwhelmed, anxious, scared, financially struggling, big time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once chemotherapy shrank the tumor to about half its original size, Cameron surgically removed the mass. The operation was followed by radiation treatment. Despite the difficult circumstances, Jonny was an "amazing" patient, Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have vivid memories of him just going around the unit in his little red wagon and playing, constantly laughing," Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't really take anything for granted"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now just over 2 years old, Jonny is "in remission but undergoing careful surveillance," Cameron said. He will undergo frequent scans to ensure the tumor does not return, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Often the higher and highest risk time to have a relapse of this very difficult disease is in the first year or two after you complete your chemotherapy," Boal said. "We are watching him very closely, but very hopeful that he will not have a recurrence of this." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortiz said that children who survive malignant rhabdoid tumor often see later-in-life side effects, including an increased risk for developing a second form of cancer. Jonny will also recieve IV antibiotics monthly for the next few months to keep infections from taking advantage of his compromised immune system, caused by the chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she worries for Jonny's future, but is just trying to enjoy the current moment. He had his chemotherapy port removed, and the family recently began getting rid of the medical supplies they had acquired during Jonny's treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We still live minute by minute, day by day, week by week, as much as we can soak up every moment," she said. "After that kind of experience, we don't really take anything for granted anymore." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An emotional birthday&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Robichau and Terrell, the end of August was an emotional time time. Less than a year ago, she had been told to expect the worst. But this summer, the family was able to focus on planning Jonny's second birthday party. The event overlapped with the couple's twins' birthday, and meant they could turn what had been a traumatic day into a celebratory one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It all happened around this time," Robichau said. "We had the party on the twins' birthday, because that was the day he left (for the hospital). So we want to change that a little bit." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after the party, Jonny saw Boal at Mass General Hospital to ensure the cancer was still in remission. His scans were clear, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CBS News spoke to Robichau, Jonny could be heard chattering in the background. Terrell said he was "running around like nothing happened." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's becoming more and more real," Robichau said. "It's been a long, long year. We're just transitioning to our new normal." &lt;/p&gt;

Now, though, some people infected with COVID in China &lt;a href="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are reporting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;are reporting&lt;/a&gt; a very sore throat that’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; trends data, people throughout the U.S. are now, too, worried about this scary-sounding symptom and are searching for things like “new covid variant painful symptom” and “covid razor throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how worried do you need to be about a super-painful sore throat during a COVID infection? Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b9f0c5e4b09c6f4cf68f07" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said. Doctors recommend getting the COVID shot to prevent severe disease, particularly if you’re 65 or older or have an underlying medical condition. The eligibility of who can get this year’s vaccine and the availability of the shot is currently murky, so check your state health department’s current requirements and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

They’re trying to get vaccinated ahead of a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe we can’t get” the vaccine, D’Amico said in an interview. “I’ve been inoculated a number of times and never had to get a prescription. And it’s just very frustrating that this is where we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not alone in his exasperation. Under the leadership of the vaccine skeptic Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal agencies have effectively made it more difficult to get vaccinated against COVID-19 this year. The Food and Drug Administration has only “approved” COVID-19 vaccines for those age 65 and up, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means across the country, people younger than 65 interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine must now either consult with a healthcare provider or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying health condition. It’s a potential hurdle that can make getting the vaccine more difficult and, some health experts worry, prompt even more Americans to eschew getting vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As D’Amico can attest, though, being part of a group for whom the COVID vaccine is “approved” doesn’t necessarily guarantee easy access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me to go to my primary [healthcare provider] now and get a prescription, it’s just kind of ridiculous,” D’Amico said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least some people younger than 65 are encountering pharmacy staff asking probing questions about their medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That happened Friday at a CVS in Orange County, according to 34-year-old Alex Benson, who takes medication that can suppress his immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides just protecting himself, he wanted to get vaccinated as he has family members who are at high risk should they get COVID — his mother is immunocompromised, and his mother-in-law had open-heart surgery on Thursday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson said an employee asked why he thought he was eligible for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They asked me for either a prescription or they wanted to know ... why I felt I needed the vaccination,” Benson said. At one point, a staffer offered to call his doctor to get an authorization for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson said he was alarmed by the questions, and started to “feel kind of some desperation to plead my case to the pharmacist.” Another CVS staffer later came over and said further answers weren’t necessary and simply attesting he was eligible was good enough. He eventually got the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he felt the experience was dismaying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think easy access should be the policy,” Benson said. “I tend not to get too political, but it seems just rather juxtaposed to me that an anti-regulation administration is using regulation in this way. They’re supposed to be removing barriers to healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine chaos comes as COVID-19 is either increasing or starting to hit its late summer peak. According to data released Friday, there are now 14 states with “very high” levels of coronavirus detected in their wastewater — California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Connecticut, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said data continue to show an increase in coronavirus cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over this past week, we’ve seen an increase in the number of outpatient COVID cases, and even a smattering of inpatient cases,” Hudson said. “It appears that we may be nearing the top of the wave, but it may be another two weeks or so until we truly know if we’re there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus lab tests are confirming infection also continues to rise statewide and in the Los Angeles area. For the week ending Aug. 30, California’s COVID test positivity rate was 12.83%, up from 7.05% for the week ending Aug. 2. In L.A. County, the positive test rate was 14.83%, up from 9.33%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data, however, suggest some areas may have reached their summer COVID peak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, the COVID positive test rate was 13.1%. That’s below the prior week’s rate of 18%, but still higher than the rate for the week that ended Aug. 2, which was 10.8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, the test positivity rate has been hovering around 9% for the last week of reliable data available. It’s up from 7% a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, wastewater data in L.A. County show coronavirus levels declined slightly from the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s too early to know if this decrease in wastewater viral concentrations is the first sign that COVID-19 activity is peaking or is regular variation typical of this data source,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID hospital admissions in California are increasing — with the latest rate of 3.93 admissions per 100,000 residents, up from 2.38. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they remain relatively low statewide and in L.A. County. The number of L.A. County residents seeking care for COVID-related illness, or who have been hospitalized, “is quite a bit lower than during summer surges in 2023 and 2024,” the public health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relatively mild summer wave, however, could mean that the annual fall-and-winter COVID wave might be stronger. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/covid-rising-in-california-how-bad-will-this-summer-be"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the state Department of Public Health said that scientists anticipate California would see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current confusion over federal COVID vaccine policy has been exacerbated by the chaos at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where Kennedy earlier this year fired everyone on the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and orchestrated the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez just 29 days after she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Kennedy’s handpicked replacements on the ACIP have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. And the new interim CDC director — Jim O’Neill, a Kennedy deputy — is a &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/jim-oneill-cdc-kennedy-trump-vaccines-58fd24f678bf46ea6ec96a2b09f85ff4" target="_blank"&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt; of health regulations and has no training in medicine or healthcare, the AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC hasn’t issued its own recommendations on who should get vaccinated, and that inaction has resulted in residents of a number of states needing to get prescriptions from a healthcare provider for at least the next couple of weeks. In some cases, that’s true even for seniors, as D’Amico found out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, CVS said people need a prescription to get a COVID-19 vaccine, sometimes depending on their age, in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS couldn’t even offer the COVID-19 at its pharmacies in Nevada as of Friday; they were only available at the company’s MinuteClinic sites, according to spokesperson Amy Thibault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS said it expects to offer COVID-19 vaccines without prescriptions at its pharmacies in New Mexico, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania “soon,” due to recent regulatory changes in each state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, all patients in all states need to attest to being eligible for the vaccine in order to schedule an appointment online,” Thibault said. If an adult says they have no underlying health conditions, but do have a prescription from a healthcare provider for “off-label” use of the vaccine, they can get the shot, Thibault confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Hawaii joined California, Washington and Oregon in launching the West Coast Health Alliance: an interstate compact meant to provide science-based immunization guidance as an alternative to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these states will provide evidence-based immunization guidance rooted in safety, efficacy, and transparency — ensuring residents receive credible information free from political interference,” according to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/04/hawaii-to-join-west-coast-health-alliance-with-california-oregon-and-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement suggested that the Trump administration was essentially “dismantling” the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The absence of consistent, science-based federal leadership poses a direct threat to our nation’s health security,” the statement said. “To protect the health of our communities, the West Coast Health Alliance will continue to ensure that our public health strategies are based on best available science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear, however, whether the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance  would make it easier for people to get COVID-19 vaccines at the nation’s largest pharmacy retailers, where many people get their shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical groups, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, are also offering their own recommendations to advise individuals and families on what vaccines they should get. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPQW9xbUFxREZPS2MxS0RoVnlSTjZ0ZkZfWUJ0TF9xREk4LWpGQkhGZGZ6WkNFaEZEejVObWVrYWxXZXhyUjBZaVVCN01XN3VpYjh4N09EMk53M2t5V2JPY004SjNIemFHc3MzVFo1NUVfNjVFSHM5OGdFQVJHSjE1Tm1GekwxeVlnSXd2emo5dl81SXhKeTZTT3Z6X3BzQ1l5RHgzVmdMY0prU0k0Tm1kZWd3UEFNNUdiRHhUQTl2c2JOcGJvMU90eVdQazllS0U</guid></item><item><title>拉里·埃里森（ Larry Ellison ）花费数十亿美元重塑牛津大学及其遗产--《华尔街日报》</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/business/larry-ellison-is-spending-billions-to-reshape-oxford-and-his-own-legacy-b5fc3262</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNV1J4Mmoxd2ttYVBvOE9LWjJibEZvWU5Sdk1NUm5FZzY1T0pZdS11RHRiMG5kZFdySF83Ul9fYXFRQTdsUUJCbXJQUERVLXBFdzdmVU9qTHRjcnItejlqRDZDbzYzeVV2UmxBX0lYaUZtdFozNTNMWWJRTW0zQ29hbmNqUWw3Sm45T0FHbnBNcmpuSFV4NTVjX201M24zcDh1OTZKOUp5dzJFd2oyZWc</guid></item><item><title>什么是最健康的空气炸锅食品？注册营养师称重- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/what-healthiest-air-fryer-foods-registered-dietitians-weigh-in/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Air fryers have become known as a healthier alternative to other cooking methods because, according to Melissa Jaeger, head of nutrition at nutrition tracking app &lt;a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_self"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;, "Air fryer cooking delivers the crispy texture we know and love from fried foods, but with far less oil and fat than traditional deep frying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;If you're interested in using your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-air-fryer/" target="_self"&gt;air fryer&lt;/a&gt; for healthy recipes but don't know where to start, we contacted registered dietitians to uncover the healthiest air fryer foods. Plus, they offer helpful, easy recipes for busy nights and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/8-essential-air-fryer-tips-for-newbies/" target="_self"&gt;air fryer tips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Salmon &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topped with lemon and herbs, salmon can make for a tasty air fryer meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;PJjaruwan / Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my opinion, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/10-minutes-and-no-mess-i-cant-believe-how-easy-this-method-for-cooking-salmon-is/" target="_self"&gt;salmon is hands-down&lt;/a&gt; the best healthy air fryer food," says &lt;a href="https://www.jmcallisterrd.com/" target="_self"&gt;Jessica McAllister&lt;/a&gt;, a military and tactical performance registered dietitian. "It's packed with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/visual-protein-guide-understanding-your-daily-protein-needs/" target="_self"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-omega-3-supplements-for-a-healthy-heart/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; and valuable micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/are-you-getting-enough-sun-heres-what-to-know-about-vitamin-d-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, B12 and selenium." Since it's a lean protein, salmon can promote muscle repair and energy, while its omega-3s reduce inflammation and support brain and heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAllister also likes salmon for meal-prepping lunches and dinners because it reheats well. To change things up, you can pair the protein with different spices or sauces for each meal. &lt;a href="https://yvettehill.com/" target="_self"&gt;Yvette Hill&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle medicine dietitian-nutritionist, endorses garlic powder, thyme, pepper and a squeeze of lemon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, McAllister warns that you should monitor the cook time of your salmon when it's in the air fryer. Her recipe of choice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brush salmon fillets lightly with olive oil or add a simple spice blend for flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 7 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness. Don't overcrowd the basket so the air can circulate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeping the skin on the salmon can be another way to consume more healthy fat," Hill adds. "The skin of the salmon contains a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids." It will also make the salmon extra crispy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reheat your salmon, set the air fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Veggie chips &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get creative and try a variety of vegetables when air-frying your veggie chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jenny Dettrick/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian Amy Chow of &lt;a href="https://bcdietitians.ca/" target="_self"&gt;BC Dietitians&lt;/a&gt; recommends making veggie chips in the air fryer because they're easy and quick to make, can be added to a meal or eaten as a snack and are crispy and flavorful enough for both adults and kids to enjoy. She suggests sliced sweet potatoes, carrots, zucchini or kale as chips, or cauliflower or broccoli florets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Make sure to cover broccoli with foil as it can burn easily in the air fryer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get all the fiber, vitamins and antioxidants from the vegetables without the extra calories or saturated fat from deep-frying," Chow says. "For kids especially, it's a way to make vegetables fun and familiar, like chips or fries, but with more nutrition." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sweet potato chips, Chow provides these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrub the sweet potato skin under cold running water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the skin on, thinly and evenly slice the potatoes into 1/16-inch thick pieces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toss the slices with a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt. You can also add spices such as chili powder or cumin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrange the slices in a single layer with no overlap in your air fryer. Cook at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 8 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let them cool to crisp up before eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A light coating of olive oil or avocado oil can help with browning, flavor and texture, whereas too much can make the food soggy and greasy," Chow adds. "Using parchment paper or a liner can help absorb some of the excess oil, prevent sticking and maintain the integrity of the air fryer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Air fried chicken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's fried chicken, but healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Cavan Images/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a healthier, quicker alternative to traditional fried chicken, Hill advocates for air frying your chicken. "This alternative is healthier because you don't have to coat or bread the chicken, and you don't have to deep-fry it in oil," she says. "The air fryer will also reduce fat in the chicken, allowing the excess to drip into the collecting tray beneath." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill's quick recipe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry-rub chicken wings with your spice blend of choice and add a small amount of olive oil. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without overcrowding the basket, air fry the wings for 16 to 22 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, flipping them halfway through cooking for extra crispiness. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Whole veggies you'd normally roast or steam &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower is just one example of a veggie you can cook in your air fryer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If slicing veggies for chips is too much after a long day, Jaeger proposes simplifying things even more by using the air fryer to cook whole vegetables you'd normally roast or steam in the oven or on the stovetop. Think Brussels sprouts, cauliflower or broccoli. Lightly toss them in oil and your favorite seasoning blend, and then pop them in the air fryer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since many people fall short of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;daily fiber needs&lt;/a&gt; and don't eat enough vegetables, air frying can be a simple way to make veggies more enjoyable," Jaeger explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriella Nowicki, a registered dietitian-nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://rbitzer.com/team/gabriella-nowicki/" target="_self"&gt;Rebecca Bitzer and Associates&lt;/a&gt;, adds that vegetables that contain a moderate amount of starch typically roast well in an air fryer. This includes potatoes, carrots, squash, plantains and beets. "A small amount of oil combined with a light dusting of cornstarch is often sufficient to achieve that crispy exterior," Nowicki says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cooking time, Nowicki warns that dense starchy vegetables like potatoes or squash may require more time in the air fryer than lighter veggies like broccoli or green beans. "Play around with temperature and time to find the perfect crispiness for you," she advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Sweet potato fries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single layer is key when making sweet potato fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Corin Cesaric/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Air frying can help retain more nutrients in sweet potatoes versus other methods of cooking them, such as boiling," says Hill. "Boiling can cause loss of water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin C."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make your sweet potato fries, according to Hill:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash and dry the potatoes before cutting them into 1/4-inch think pieces, lengthwise. You can keep the skin on to make them crispier. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add olive oil, rosemary and a pinch of salt. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrange them in a single layer in your basket. Air fry at 390 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is air frying considered healthier than frying?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The primary concern with traditional frying lies in the cooking method itself," Nowicki says. "Most fried foods are first coated in batter or breading, which increases the carbohydrate and calorie content before the food even touches the oil. Once submerged in hot oil, the breading absorbs significant amounts of fat, further raising the overall calorie density of the dish."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of oil you're using and the high temperature are also factors to consider. Nowicki states that many commercial frying oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can promote inflammation when consumed in excess. Heating that oil over and over again also generates &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590157525003888#s0255" target="_self"&gt;potentially toxic oxidation byproducts&lt;/a&gt; and, in some cases, trans fats, which are linked to increased cardiovascular health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Air frying takes the excess breading and oil out of the equation and therefore, is healthier," Nowicki says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 top air-frying tips from experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't overcrowd your basket: &lt;/strong&gt;"Air fryers are designed for the best cooking results when the basket isn't overcrowded or foods are cooked in a single layer," Jaeger explains. "Consider batch cooking to keep meal items in a single layer or shaking the basket at various times while cooking to ensure foods stuck in the middle layer don't result in a soggy mess."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use only a light coating of oil:&lt;/strong&gt; To prevent sticking and achieve a crispy exterior, Nowicki suggests using a light coating of oil like avocado oil or canola oil for temperatures over 425 degrees Fahrenheit. "This will reduce oxidation," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shake the basket: &lt;/strong&gt;Both Jaeger and Nowicki recommend shaking your air fryer's basket halfway through the cooking process to ensure that everything cooks and crisps evenly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 07:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOQU1uVFBONVhqd25PbzZhVGpndjJHZ1RidldIb2lNcmpmVkNjaE5ScjdGd2tOOWFQUkNCU2ZCRmNqbFRtQjRhd2MwTWdnWVM1eFBlMVRQYnQtQVgwV2xraUJsaFdSRTZOZTdualpkSnRVS1M0SWNMd2tUUTZKUXJIdFFuWERDUTh2Q0JGMWNsR1FZalBLWUJuRzRvSElvLUN2YmxR</guid></item><item><title>每天吃同样的早餐有益健康吗？营养师称重- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/is-it-healthy-to-eat-the-same-breakfast-every-day-11802140</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to choosing meals, breakfast tends to be the one we repeat the most.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This makes sense, since mornings can be hectic, and having a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7922416/dietitian-make-ahead-breakfasts-for-busy-weeks/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;go-to breakfast option&lt;/a&gt; makes busy mornings a little easier. But is it actually healthy to eat the same breakfast every day? Here’s what dietitians say about being a breakfast repeater. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Reduces Decision Fatigue  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sticking to the same breakfast each day can reduce decision fatigue,” says &lt;a href="https://www.healthbysapna.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. With breakfast already planned, you can conserve the energy you’d normally spend on deciding what to eat for breakfast for more important stuff. Plus, some people actually look forward to having the same daily breakfast. “It offers a sense of routine, which can be comforting—especially for those who enjoy structure in their mornings,” she adds. Another win? Making the same thing for breakfast can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-grocery-budget-tips-11688884" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;simplify your grocery list&lt;/a&gt;, cutting down on even more decision-making.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You Stick to Something That Works for You &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the saying goes, “If it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” This can apply to your favorite breakfast too. “When my clients find a breakfast that works for them, I recommend they stick to it as many days a week as possible,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Everyone is different, and so once you find that breakfast that is satisfying, balanced and provides long-lasting energy, it makes sense to stick to it or at least some variation of it.” For some, that might mean &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-popular-smoothie-recipes-to-start-your-morning-11723706" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;whipping up a daily smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. For others, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/273189/summer-skillet-vegetable-egg-scramble/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;veggie-filled egg scramble&lt;/a&gt; is their top breakfast pick. “This takes the guesswork out of your first meal, which can profoundly impact your day in a positive way,” explains Mitri.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Starts Your Day Off Right &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if you’re having the same thing every day, a well-balanced breakfast can set the tone for making healthier choices the rest of the day. “If it’s a healthy breakfast (e.g., rolled oats and fruit, or eggs with whole-grain toast), you’ve gotten your day off to a good start,” says &lt;a href="https://www.soundbitesnutrition.com/about-lisa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. The key is making sure that your staple breakfast provides an optimal balance of protein, carbohydrates and healthy fats for sustained energy that will power you through the whole morning. Having a balanced breakfast can also give you a head start on meeting the daily recommendations for essential nutrients like folate, vitamin C and calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cons-of-eating-the-same-breakfast-every-day"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Cons of Eating the Same Breakfast Every Day &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Get Boring &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While eating the same breakfast every day may work for some people, others may get bored eating in this way,” says Mitri. She adds that this breakfast monotony could potentially derail your health goals: “Boredom may lead to dissatisfaction with your meals or cravings later on because you’re yearning for more variety.” If you find yourself in a breakfast rut, it may be time to switch things up. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Miss Out on Important Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Missing out on a variety of nutrients is another drawback to being a breakfast repeater. “Eating the same breakfast every day limits the number of nutrients in that meal. Because of this, you may risk missing out on other essential nutrients that you would otherwise get if you had more of a variety of breakfast options in your rotation,” says Mitri. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut health depends on meal variety too. “Your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome thrives on dietary diversity&lt;/a&gt;, so too much repetition might not be ideal—though this can be balanced out by varying your other meals,” explains Peruvemba. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-final-verdict"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good news—dietitians agree that sticking to a go-to breakfast isn’t inherently a bad thing. To make the most of your breakfast, consider these tips: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Savory Rather Than Sweet. &lt;/strong&gt;When deciding on your staple breakfast, Andrews suggests opting for savory options like eggs or frittata versus sweet ones like muffins or waffles. “This may help curb your sweet tooth for the rest of the day and give you more energy in the morning,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Some Protein. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to keeping you full, eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-recipes-with-at-least-20-grams-of-protein-11690743" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich breakfast&lt;/a&gt; has other perks. “Protein at breakfast was found to keep blood sugar levels lower at lunch and dinner, according to a small study in healthy adults,” says Andrews.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There’s also evidence that eating a protein-rich breakfast may support heart health, such as better blood pressure regulation and HDL (“good”) cholesterol, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Forget About Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;Picking a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-foods-to-eat-for-breakfast-8697701" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber breakfast&lt;/a&gt; to repeat helps you get closer to the daily fiber goal of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men—a goal most people fall short of.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Include foods that are high in both protein and fiber to help regulate blood sugar and your appetite. A veggie omelet with whole-grain toast and fresh or frozen fruit is an ‘eggscellent’ way to start your day,” says Andrews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Variety the Rest of the Day&lt;/strong&gt;. If you like to eat the same thing in the morning, make sure that you are covering all of your nutrition bases by eating more variety at lunch, dinner and snacks. “Balance out the routine by including a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods in your other meals throughout the day,” says Peruvemba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switch Up Some Ingredients.&lt;/strong&gt; ”If you like the same breakfast every day, you can still stick to the same general ‘formula,’ while rotating some of the ingredients,” says Mitri. “For example, if [you eat] overnight oats every morning, you can mix the ingredients up every few days, such as the type of fruit you add in, other toppings like nuts or seeds, or rotate different nut butters like almond, peanut or sunflower. Doing this allows you to enjoy the same overall meal while maintaining variety in nutrient content and flavor.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s a favorite smoothie, overnight oats or scrambled eggs and toast, many of us have at least one go-to breakfast that we make again and again. Dietitians agree that if it works for you, there’s no need to change things up—especially if it’s a breakfast that offers plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-fiber-and-high-protein-meal-plan-8646974" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;filling fiber and protein&lt;/a&gt;. The one caveat is that you’ll want to plan a bit of variety in the rest of your meals so that you aren’t missing out on any key nutrients. To prevent boredom, you can also add interest to your staple breakfast by switching out toppings or mix-ins rather than picking something entirely new. If deciding what to eat each morning feels exhausting, make one final decision: stick to the same breakfast.&lt;br&gt;

Importantly, eating breakfast later with aging was linked to a higher risk of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status,” lead author &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/14405948/Hassan-Dashti" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a senior couple eating breakfast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity,” senior author Dr. Altug Didikoglu, MSc, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey, said in the statement. “Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,’ especially for older individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/eating-breakfast-later-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-11804603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 04:25:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE02TXVESzlxQVYwRU4xOWwzWTYwdG1zZGNNNW9qSnNfcHBtcTVDZjJNdk1RMk53RTFOYUdwNnZ4R0RFeUl2MVlSQ2pPeFNPZWo4aWRkLUdIcmR4R25hZDlDeDJyOWctZHhPWE5SN2ZEZFpZU09KVTNSbg</guid></item></channel></rss>
