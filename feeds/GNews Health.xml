The asparagus plant produces &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003194221300352X?via=ihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a compound called the asparagusic acid&lt;/a&gt; and, when it's digested by your body, it releases sulphur compounds too. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/533914" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;It's these chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, such as methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide, that make your sweat and your pee smell a certain way. Sulphur compounds are very volatile, so they easily disperse in the air. That's why they're so easy to smell from the toilet bowl. This smell usually lasts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12264" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;more than five hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Not everybody produces this smell, although studies about this &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;keep &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;coming up with different findings&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1950s, research seemed to suggest that fewer than 50% of people produce the tell-tale asparagus pee odour, while in 2010, researchers found more than 90% of test participants did. So it’s not clear cut. And not everybody can perceive the stink: the ability to smell one's pungent &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/36/1/9/442551?login=false" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;asparagus-smelling pee seems to be down to genetics&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, when it comes to fruit and vegetables more widely, eating more of them can lead to a more attractive scent. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513816301933" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;A 2017 study in Australia&lt;/a&gt; found that men who had consumed more fruit and vegetables were significantly associated with smelling better – more fruity, floral and sweet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study also notes, interestingly, when people have to rate people's faces, slightly yellower skin rich in carotenoid – a molecule from carrots, pumpkins, tomatoes and papayas and others – is also found to be more attractive. But the same study suggests that people consuming diets with a little bit of fat, meat, egg, and tofu intake were also associated with more pleasant-smelling sweat. Carb-heavy diets produced the least sexy of scents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Meat and fish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meat and fish can also produce a distinct body odour as animal proteins are broken down by the body into amino acids and fats, which are then excreted through sweat – where they interact with skin bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNakprX2xSVmdrUVR3Z21GWnRiRnFhS2Q0YW90Q3IzVW03NUk1U3lfQkdFanVSNG5mZTA4SHRLVDlHcm1RMkNVcXhDcEJBbHJsYm9lZi1BRDF6Mk93TDJza0cwU20ycGtmVWQtQnZxYnpBVUdlbFlmZkpXanpBcDRjYTkwa0lDekhYcFZYUHRzazcxSXc</guid></item><item><title>我是一名传染病医生。以下是当我在飞机上坐在怀疑接种疫苗的人旁边时发生的事情。- Yahoo News UK</title><link>https://uk.news.yahoo.com/im-infectious-disease-doctor-heres-023104848.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s hard to believe that infectious diseases have become a political litmus test, but they are now very much part of the “with us or against us” mental sorting more and more people seem to be doing these days.

I’m not a military strategist, but I can’t imagine that indiscriminately infecting outdoor enthusiasts with a non-deadly, treatable disease that requires transmission via a slow-feeding arthropod would be an ideal bioterrorism plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But why is it spreading so fast now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Climate change, expanding tick habitats and food sources, and a lack of winters that kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He laughed. “So in your ‘profesh’ opinion, Lyme disease as a bioterrorism weapon is a bunch of horseshit?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes. That I do agree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We moved on to the next obvious infectious disease topic: COVID-19. I gave him space. He wasn’t sparring with a lack of respect, nor was I. We opened up about experiencing the pandemic in completely different ways. He described how hard it was being forced to get vaccinated, feeling coerced to keep his job but fearing the vaccine’s purported harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I shared my experience working in the hospital. I told him how I had witnessed numerous people die alone, and how the vaccine was a true savior. He believed it was only old people who had died. I told him I had seen enough young, healthy people become debilitated that I would never make that bet, not in that pandemic or the next one. In fact, by September 2023, &lt;a href="https://data.cdc.gov/National-Center-for-Health-Statistics/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku/data_preview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I tried to hear his concerns. I admitted that my passion for science and what I had experienced as a physician may have made me unfairly dismissive of people whose primary concerns were being stuck at home unable to pay rent or educate their children. I acknowledged that there’s always a small chance that some people might experience an adverse reaction to any medical intervention, be it a vaccine or over-the-counter drug, and I can understand why that makes some people hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I also reiterated the rigor of the scientific process involved in developing treatments, reviewing safety data, and ultimately making clinical recommendations. I told him that mRNA vaccines are neither new — &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/decades-making-mrna-covid-19-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:they’ve been in development for decades;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;they’ve been in development for decades&lt;/a&gt; — nor a government-led conspiracy to genetically manipulate the population. The reference to “genetic material” may lead to misconceptions, but mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus, where our DNA resides. Our cells do not even possess the molecular machinery capable of turning mRNA into DNA. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/how-they-work.html#:~:text=How%20mRNA%20COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fact&lt;/a&gt;, not just my “profesh” opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It felt real, the effort to hear and speak to each other. And I learned things from him, too. In response to my insistence that his infection-related conspiracy theories were nothing but that, he admitted, “Yeah, you’re probably right.” Then he added, with a smile on his face, “But conspiracies are a lot more fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracies are a lot more fun&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe vaccine or disease origin conspiracies are fun — if you’re young and healthy, if you’re bored, if you’re motivated to access a community that promises you “inside information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for the population as a whole, they are unbelievably dangerous. Conspiracy theories are why a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year&lt;/a&gt;, why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/us/gunman-cdc-shooting-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting&lt;/a&gt;.

The experience left me with genuine hope that we could maintain trust in each other and reminded me that scientists and physicians cannot give up on having these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With COVID, vaccines, Lyme disease, any of it — I’m not your enemy,” I told my seatmate as we were getting ready to disembark. “And I know you’re not the enemy, either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“True,” he agreed. “But they always want to make someone your enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. That is what conspiracy theories require. That is why we have to talk to each other. See me as a person. And I will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I am not your enemy.

And the topic seems to be everywhere.

observed, the study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125014835?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Environmental Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;, found that long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide — a pollutant released during the combustion of oil and gas and during mining activity — increases the risk of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At an ALS clinic in New Brunswick, Canada, doctors noticed a spike in cases. In response, lead author Daniel Saucier launched a study comparing 304 individuals with the disease to 1,207 healthy individuals, all of the same age and sex. The research used records of environmental pollutants connected to the participants' areas of residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Saucier, who holds a master's degree in diagnostic methods for ALS, told ABC that "it looked like air pollution was potentially related to the increased cases of ALS in New Brunswick, with sulfur dioxide appearing to be the one that had a significant association of ALS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study found that people exposed to sulfur dioxide over long periods had a 23% higher risk of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Saucier, while burning dirty fuels releases sulfur dioxide, so does "anything that has to do with mining activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All study areas met Canada's &lt;a href="https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clean air guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;clean air guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, yet the research identified a significant health association between sulfur dioxide exposure and ALS risk. The authors concluded that preventive strategies will be needed to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is air pollution concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide are released during the extraction and use of coal, oil, and gas. While these fuels remain central to global energy production, their by-products pose serious risks to workers, communities, and the environment, especially in industrial zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond sulfur dioxide, many other industrial carbon pollutants contribute to rising global temperatures. A warmer planet intensifies natural disasters, sea-level rise, and other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about air pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With new technologies emerging that reduce or eliminate the need to mine and burn dirty fuels, many workplace and public safety concerns can be avoided. For example, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/install-solar-panels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:solar panels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt; generate electricity without releasing harmful pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, rising health concerns from exposure to pollution drive a growing demand for cleaner energy. Advocating for solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear energy shows policymakers that the public truly cares about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cleaner energy is also becoming increasingly popular and more affordable. A LUT University study concluded that a complete transition is &lt;a href="https://www.lut.fi/en/news/researchers-agree-world-can-reach-100-renewable-energy-system-2050" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:feasible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;feasible&lt;/a&gt; and could occur before 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the world relies more on renewable energy sources, health risks will decrease as heat-trapping pollutants are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smaller steps, such as reducing your environmental footprint, are also a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Switching from gas-guzzling cars to electric vehicles, turning off lights and appliances when not in use, and eating more plant-based meals are all helpful lifestyle changes that can reduce pollution and the demand for dirty fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec0rX1mps1JFgqJm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

But it's proving difficult for authorities to get a grip on the drug being sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In April, the government-backed Safe Internet League reported the growing trend involving young people to the authorities - prompting several major online marketplaces to remove Molecule from sale. But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling "unregistered dietary supplements" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as "sports nutrition" instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine. But it admitted it was difficult to find and remove listings that didn't explicitly mention sibutramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you do manage to get your hands on Molecule, it's hard to know exactly what you're getting - and it's unclear where the pills are being manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The BBC found some sellers with production certificates from factories in Guangzhou and Henan, in China. Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;&lt;i id="details-of-support-with-eating-disorders-in-the-uk-are-available-at" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Details of support with eating disorders in the UK are available at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2DRkg4JC7SLT3B7hlrn6DKN/information-and-support-eating-disorders" class="sc-f9178328-0 kgTYQp"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;BBC Action Line&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders. For those in or near relapse, an easily available appetite suppressant can be seriously dangerous, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Anna Enina, a Russian influencer with millions of followers who herself has admitted using unlicensed weight-loss pills in the past, publicly warned her subscribers: "As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder... the consequences will be dire.

Also known as Xerostomia, this is an oral health condition that reduces saliva flow, leading to various symptoms including bad breath, rapid tooth decay and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How common is Dry Mouth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to dentists, the condition is more common than you think. Dry Mouth affects about one in five people, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10902-dry-mouth-xerostomia" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. However, Dr Kourosh Maddahi, a dentist at Dion Health in California shared with NBC Select, that the condition is underdiagnosed as people often mistake it with dehydration. And the longer it remains undiagnosed the more damage it creates for your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Home remedies to get rid of bad breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 report by the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/xerostomia#:~:text=Severity%20of%20dry%20mouth%20symptoms,22%25%20of%20the%20global%20population." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; stated that dry mouth affects about 10 to 26 per cent of men and 10 to 33 per cent of women.

Most treatments for dry mouth consist of over-the-counter products such as mouthwashes, gels, chewing gums and lozenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes longer lifestyle changes such as avoiding certain food items and drinks are also required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding dry mouth or xerostomia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple words, dry mouth is a condition that makes the mouth feel dry due to an inadequate amount of saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent causes of the condition are the use of certain medications. As per a 2018 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29071719/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, urologic medications, antidepressants and psycholeptics were associated with dry mouth in adults. Additionally, chemotherapy or head and neck cancer radiotherapy can also cause the condition as they directly cause toxicity to salivary glands and oral tissues. And, tobacco and cannabis use can also accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry mouth can be damaging to oral health because of the changes it causes to the amount and consistency of saliva in the mouth. Saliva is a natural antibiotic in the mouth and protects it from bacteria, acts as a lubricant, and cleans plaque and other particles from teeth.

							&lt;p&gt;We all want to stay sharp as we move through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a lot about mental fitness before, but this one struck me personally. A new international study found that people who regularly engage in creative practices have brains that look &lt;em&gt;seven years younger&lt;/em&gt; than their actual age. Seven years. That’s not small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, used neuroimaging data to study brain “age gaps.” They discovered that adults who frequently &lt;a href="https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-circuits-consciousness-and-cognition/news/news-detailseite/article/creative-minds-younger-brains-new-study-shows-creative-experiences-delay-brain-aging.html?.com"&gt;take part in creative activities&lt;/a&gt; such as music, writing, dance, or crafts tend to show younger neural profiles than their peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means creativity isn’t just about expression; it’s a kind of brain exercise. Below are eight creative skills that may literally keep your brain younger, backed by psychology and science, with a few observations from my own experience thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one creative activity that shows up again and again in brain-aging research, it’s music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you play an instrument, you’re not just moving your hands; you’re processing pitch, rhythm, timing, and emotion. You’re reading or remembering notes, coordinating muscle movement, and listening closely for feedback. That’s multiple brain regions working together in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; paper found that musicians tend to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1100848?.com"&gt;maintain stronger white-matter integrity&lt;/a&gt; and higher neural efficiency in older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started revisiting my old music-blogger roots and picked up a ukulele last year. I won’t be winning any Grammys, but the process of learning new chords and strumming patterns feels like mental yoga. It forces focus and flexibility in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even 10 to 15 minutes of practice a few times a week can make a difference. The goal isn’t mastery; it’s engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Visual arts (painting, drawing, digital art)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If music isn’t your thing, pick up a pencil. Or a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual arts such as painting, drawing, sculpting, or even digital illustration light up brain regions tied to spatial awareness, visual memory, and creative planning. Studies show that people who regularly engage in artistic expression have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-025-00063-3?.com"&gt;better cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt; and stronger emotional regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a trip to Costa Rica a few years ago, I took a one-day outdoor sketching class. I was awful at it. But here’s what surprised me: focusing on the interplay of light and shadow, seeing how colors shift at different times of day, it changed how I noticed the world afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity rewires perception. That’s what keeps the brain young; it keeps it curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Dance and movement arts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever noticed how dancers seem ageless? There’s science behind that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancing doesn’t just engage the body; it stimulates the cerebellum, hippocampus, and motor cortex, all areas tied to coordination and memory. Tango dancers, in particular, have shown&lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/creative-hobbies-could-help-keep-your-brain-young-180987476/?.com"&gt; slower cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; compared to non-dancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dance blends rhythm, movement, emotion, and improvisation. It’s one of the most “whole-brain” creative practices out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not naturally coordinated, but a few summers ago, I joined a friend for a salsa class in Los Angeles. Between laughing at my two left feet and trying to follow the beat, I realized how alive I felt. My brain was firing on all cylinders, anticipating, reacting, adapting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to join a dance troupe. Even a weekly class, or moving freely to your favorite song in your living room, counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Photography and visual composition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography gets overlooked in the creative skill conversation, but it shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you compose a shot, you’re making a thousand micro-decisions: where to focus, what to include, what to leave out. You’re adjusting light, color, and angle. You’re engaging visual-spatial reasoning, memory, and intuition simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing street photography around Los Angeles lately. Carrying a camera changes the way I walk. I’m scanning for patterns, reflections, small stories in motion. It’s not just about taking a photo; it’s about learning to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;. That mental habit of curiosity keeps the brain active and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to it, start with your phone. Limit yourself to one theme, say, reflections or textures, and shoot three photos a day. It’s like mindfulness training with a creative edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Improvisational writing or storytelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is another powerful way to keep your brain elastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the key. It has to be creative writing, not just work emails or to-do lists. When you write stories, poems, or reflective essays, you’re engaging what psychologists call &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking?.com"&gt;divergent thinking&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to generate many ideas from one prompt. That’s one of the cognitive abilities most strongly linked to creative intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I travel, I sometimes write short micro-stories about the people I meet, a cab driver in Bangkok, a barista in Lisbon, a musician in Oaxaca. It’s not about publishing them; it’s about connecting dots and seeing meaning in small moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to try it? Open your notes app, pick a random object near you, and write a short story that begins with, “This object has a secret.” Don’t edit yourself. Just write for five minutes. Your prefrontal cortex will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Strategic games or creative gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear something up. Video games, board games, and puzzles can be good for your brain if they’re strategic or creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 review of over 20 studies found that people who regularly played complex games like chess, strategy video games, or world-building sims had &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-creative-hobbies-keep-your-brain-young-11836947?.com"&gt;improved cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt; and delayed signs of brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Strategy games demand decision-making, pattern recognition, and adaptation, all cognitive skills that tend to decline with age if left unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was traveling in Japan, a friend introduced me to Go. I didn’t know the rules, but once I started, I was hooked. The strategic depth is unreal. You think ten moves ahead, and it humbles you every time. That’s what the brain thrives on, challenge with feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, if you play thoughtful games regularly, it’s not wasting time. It’s brain training disguised as fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Crafting or building things (DIY)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer something tangible, crafting and DIY projects are gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These activities such as woodworking, sewing, gardening, or building furniture combine problem-solving with fine motor control. Research from the Mayo Clinic found that older adults who frequently engaged in hands-on creative activities had &lt;a href="https://time.com/3814104/adults-arts-and-crafts/?.com"&gt;a 30 percent lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing mild cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I built a small bookshelf for my vegan cookbook collection. It took twice as long as expected, and the paint job wasn’t perfect, but I noticed how mentally stimulating it was. I had to plan, measure, visualize, and adjust. Every mistake was a mini-lesson in spatial reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction you get when you finish something with your hands isn’t just emotional; it’s neurological. It tells your brain, “We can still learn new tricks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) Multimodal creative mixing (combining skills)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers call it &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00073?.com"&gt;cross-domain creativity&lt;/a&gt;, combining two or more creative modes, like music and art, or photography and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who engage in multimodal creative projects show higher integration between brain networks that don’t usually talk to each other. That cross-activation is believed to buffer against cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I once challenged myself to write a short instrumental track, photograph an image that matched its mood, and write a short essay connecting the two. It was clumsy, but it was fun. And the mental engagement was next-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point isn’t perfection; it’s exploration. Try mixing two creative hobbies you already enjoy. You’ll stretch different neural circuits at once, which is exactly what the science says keeps the brain youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to start if you feel “non-creative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the secret: creativity isn’t a talent; it’s a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can build it gradually by choosing small, doable actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play a short piece on an instrument you already have at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sketch one object from your day before bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one creative photo a day for a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal using prompts like “What did I notice today that I usually ignore?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a simple dance routine on YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build or repair something small with your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend two of the above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to engage curiosity, not to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, you’ll likely notice your attention feels sharper, your mood lighter, and your perspective wider. Those are all signs that your brain is adapting, and that’s exactly what keeps it youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who writes about psychology and decision-making, I find this body of research oddly reassuring. It means our hobbies aren’t distractions from real life; they’re part of maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older I get, the more I realize creativity isn’t about making art; it’s about staying awake to the world. It’s how we keep seeing beauty in small things, keep questioning, keep inventing. And it just so happens that those same habits might help our brains stay seven years younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whatever creative spark you’ve been ignoring, pick it up. Nurture it. Let it grow messy and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your future self and your brain will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger adults are developing a severe gut disorder at increasing rates, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis among Americans younger than 50, researchers from UCLA and Vanderbilt University recently reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the proportion of patients younger than 50 admitted to the hospital with severe diverticulitis increased by more than half, rising from just under 19% in 2005 to more than 28% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a significant shift in who is being hospitalized for severe diverticulitis," said lead researcher Shineui Kim, a fourth-year medical student at the &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/David_Geffen/" target="_blank" title="David Geffen" class="tpstyle"&gt;David Geffen&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine at UCLA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This condition was traditionally thought of as a disease of older adults, but our data shows that younger Americans are increasingly affected, and often with more complicated presentations," Kim said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverticulitis involves small pouches that form at weak spots along the wall of the colon. In severe cases, these pouches can become infected or torn, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers analyzed records of more than 5.2 million hospitalizations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these patients, about 16% were "early-onset" cases occurring in people younger than 50. The number of these cases that involved severe diverticulitis rose by 52% during the study period.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, treatment strategies also have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of younger patients requiring surgical removal of part of the colon to treat their diverticulitis dropped from nearly 35% to around 20%, showing that doctors are successfully using more conservative approaches to treat serious cases, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that younger diverticulitis patients tended to die less often and have shorter hospital stays and lower hospitalization costs compared to older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they also were more likely to require complicated procedures, with 29% higher odds of needing to remove part of the colon and 58% higher odds of requiring abscess drainage, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions," Kim said. "This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear why more younger adults are developing diverticulitis, but researchers noted the trend dovetails with an increased risk of colon cancer among this age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Little is known about why we're seeing this increase in younger patients," Kim said. "We urgently need additional research to determine what's driving these trends whether it's dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can lower their risk of diverticulitis by increasing the amount of fiber in their diet. Only surgery can remove pouches that have already developed in the colon, according to Harvard Medical School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study appears in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While we may wish it didn't, the good news is that we're much more informed about the illness once considered mysterious, including its ever-changing symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Each year and season, the COVID variants change," says &lt;a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/experts/profile/sharon-nachman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sharon Nachman, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sharon Nachman, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital. "As a result, often the symptoms change as well.

"The most common symptoms are fatigue and fever," says &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/michael-richardson/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Michael Richardson, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Michael Richardson, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He reports that other top COVID-19 symptoms in November 2025 include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shortness of breath (in severe cases)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scratchy &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-common-covid-19-symptoms-102500122.html" data-ylk='slk:"razorblade" throats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;' class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;"razorblade" throats&lt;/a&gt; were common during the summer of 2025. Some physicians &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-common-covid-19-symptoms-102500122.html" data-ylk="slk:are noticing less;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;are noticing less&lt;/a&gt; of this symptom, but others say it's alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We are hearing specifically about severe knifelike sore throat with far less cough as the primary symptom," says Dr. Nachman, who practices on Long Island in New York. "That is not to say that we don’t also expect fever, body aches and cough to occur, but rather we are seeing more throat complaints than in prior seasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thankfully, some other dangerous symptoms and side effects of COVID-19 aren't as prevalent in the fall of 2025. "While we are still seeing some COVID pneumonia, it is much less common than in prior years," says &lt;a href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Linda Yancey, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Linda Yancey, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist with Memorial Hermann Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also, doctors continue to see far less of two other symptoms once considered COVID-19 hallmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Early strains of COVID used to make people lose their sense of taste or smell, but that symptom is significantly less common today," says &lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-michael-dosik/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Michael Dosik, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Michael Dosik, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care physician with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:labfinder.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;labfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;experience a loss of taste and smell, it's a telltale sign you probably have COVID-19. However, there's only one way to tell for sure whether you have COVID-19, the flu or RSV (or none of the above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The best way to distinguish between them is by testing," Dr. Richardson clarifies. "All of them share similar symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, as COVID-19 has evolved, so have we. "Tests come back within minutes, helping to guide treatment plans and to discuss with families the possibility of [preventative strategies] for the household members," Dr. Nachman shares. "This is especially true for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-warn-look-flu-symptoms-145000937.html" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, where we have several easily available medications that people in close contact with flu can take to successfully prevent their own illness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/covid-had-startling-impact-brains-212500799.html" data-ylk="slk:COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Do We Really Need Another COVID Booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a common question, especially amid new federal guidelines—and at times, conflicting state policies. However, doctors remain firm that getting a COVID-19 booster is safe, effective and an excellent defense against severe illness from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"All adults would benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doctors-begging-patients-65-extra-202500816.html" data-ylk="slk:COVID booster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;COVID booster&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Richardson says. "Like the flu shot, the COVID booster changes and is targeted to the current strain of the illness. Getting the booster will protect you from serious side effects if you do encounter COVID."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He urges people to speak with their family physician if they have questions about the COVID-19 booster. Dr. Nachman also suggests having a close discussion with your medical provider, who knows your medical history, including your age and underlying conditions (like diabetes and lung disease), you have that might put you at a greater risk for severe illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In general, it's important to recognize that these vaccines will help prevent hospitalization and emergency room visits, but not every trace of illnesses," Dr. Nachman says. "So, yes, it will be important to get these vaccines."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When should you get your COVID-19 booster? If you're reading this in November 2025, there's no time like the present!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Now is a good time to get a COVID booster," Dr. Yancey urges. "Though most cases are mild, you can spare yourself a week of fever and cough, and you will be protecting your at-risk friends and family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/immune-system/articles/immunologists-people-over-50-adopt-182500882.html" data-ylk="slk:Immunologists Are Begging People Over 50 To Start Doing This 1 Daily Habit ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Immunologists Are Begging People Over 50 To Start Doing This 1 Daily Habit ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What's the Best Way To Treat COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, make sure you actually have COVID-19. "It’s important to be cautious and get an at-home COVID test to see if you have an active infection and need to isolate," Dr. Richardson explains. "Then, depending on the results, you should isolate or wear a mask. If the test is negative, you should check again the next day if you are still having symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you're positive, tell hustle culture to take a seat. "The best thing to do when you have COVID or any viral illness is rest and stay hydrated," Dr. Dosik explains. "Your body is fighting a battle internally, and so you shouldn’t do anything to stress it externally. Using acetaminophen or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can be useful to reduce high fevers and for pain relief to get you through the worst of the illness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;FWIW, your colleagues and boss should thank you for calling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If ill, please try to stay home from work," Dr. Nachman advises. "It does not matter if you have RSV, the flu or COVID. You are highly contagious and likely to pass these viral illnesses to your co-workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-warn-look-flu-symptoms-145000937.html" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Protects You From COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The basics still apply. "No surprises here: The best way to not get sick is to vaccinate, don’t share straws or drink from others' cups, try to stay a few feet away from someone who is coughing and wash your hands," Dr. Nachman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She reiterates that the vaccine can help prevent ER visits and hospitalizations. Cringe all you want at the idea of social distancing—it remains a best practice if someone near you seems sick. Respiratory viruses can spread through the air. The precise distance these germs can travel depends on the illness, but you likely don't know what the person near you in the grocery store has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Some pathogens on things like door knobs or can easily pass when sharing drinks, so common sense always helps," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Yancey notes that wearing a mask in crowded public spaces can also reduce viral spread. Ideally, you aren't standing next to someone who is sick and contagious at the grocery store because they stayed home—and you're doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If you aren’t feeling well, stay home," Dr. Richardson urges. "This will help you feel better faster and will also help by not spreading the illness to others...Before going back into the world, make sure you have been fever-free for the last 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for all of those &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-live-100-one-vitamin-112500554.html" data-ylk="slk:vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and supplements that promise to boost immunity?

'No kid should have to go through that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper (left) and Luna Keown were both diagnosed with the rare genetic disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which leads to an insatiable appetite and uncontrolled weight gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unable to explain the weight gain despite diet and exercise, the clinic suggested Harper undergo genetic testing last year, which revealed she had Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare condition affecting just under 5,000 Americans that causes weight gain and constant, insatiable hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition usually manifests early in childhood and progresses over time and affects nearly every major organ, eventually leading to vision loss, kidney failure and developmental delays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed Harper's younger sister, Luna, also had BBS, though she hadn't yet displayed symptoms, and both of their parents were carriers for the mutated genes that cause the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: '[The doctor] was just mind-blown. She was like, "I've never heard of this before."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BBS is caused by mutations in one of at least 24 different genes, most commonly BBS1 and BBS10, which provide instructions for the formation of cilia, hairlike structures on cells that help them relay sensory information like light, sound, smell and taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations cause a dysfunction of the brain's melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, which controls hunger and satiety. If the receptor is mutated, it cannot communicate to the brain that the body is full, leading to uncontrolled eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Harper, most patients start gaining excess weight around three to five years old, which continues into adulthood, often despite dietary changes and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna also started to gain weight around age four, jumping from 30 to 80 pounds within a few months, more than double the weight of the average preschooler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After their diagnosis, the girls were put on topiramate (known as Topamax), an anticonvulsant used off-label for weight loss, and Vyvanse, a stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder, to help slow their ravenous hunger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also take setmelanotide, a daily injection under the brand name Imcivree that targets the dysfunctional MC4R pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a complete gamechanger,' Keown told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper, pictured here, weighed 108 pounds by the time she was seven years old, and she endured bullying so bad that her family was forced to pull her out of school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Luna (left) and Harper are pictured earlier this year with their mother Ciara (right) after losing weight with medication and lifestyle changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the help of the medications, as well as dietary swaps and exercise, Harper has lost 30 pounds so far and Luna has lost 10 in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since losing the weight, Harper has regained the confidence to return to school, where she most enjoys spending time with her friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'She's braver now, like she'll stand up for herself now, whereas in kindergarten, she wouldn't stand up for herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's not had any problems. She absolutely loves [school].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the girls have lost weight, BBS still affects multiple major organ systems, leaving them with a team of about 10 specialists between the two of them. Luna is in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, while BBS has attacked Harper's liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, kidney disease can lead to growth issues, cognitive problems, anemia and incontinence. If it progresses, a kidney transplant may be necessary. And children who suffer from liver diseases may experience fatigue, nausea, a swollen abdomen, jaundice and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of children in liver failure will eventually need a transplant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in and out of doctor's [offices],' Keown said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls both have accommodations at school for their condition, including extra time during tests due to dyslexia, which BBS raises the risk of, additional restroom breaks due to kidney issues and rest time from gym class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Keown family is now working to spread awareness of BBS and connect with other families across the US. Harper has even helped other children with the condition work up the courage for their daily Imcivree shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'It's just one step at a time. I was scared at first, but it's not a death sentence, so when [other] moms reach out, I try to express that to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've heard stories of remission, so I really just want the girls to go into that. I want them to be able to to be able to manage all of this on on their own.

They not only provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants but also help regulate cholesterol, blood pressure, and inflammation, all key factors linked to ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, multiple large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants have confirmed that regular consumption of these foods is strongly associated with a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature death. Here’s a detailed look at how each of these three food groups supports long-term health and what science says about their impact on longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top 7 foods to boost immunity by nutritionist Kavita Devgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 everyday foods that can help you live longer, according to science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Whole Grains: The foundation of a healthy heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they are&lt;/strong&gt;: Whole grains include foods like oats, brown rice, barley, millets, quinoa, and whole wheat. Unlike refined grains, they retain all parts of the grain, the bran, germ, and endosperm, which makes them richer in nutrients and fibre.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific findings&lt;/strong&gt;: Meta-analyses of cohort studies involving over a million people have shown that individuals who regularly consume whole grains have a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality. A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2716" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt;2016 review published in BMJ &lt;/a&gt;and later systematic analyses confirmed that consuming about 90 grams of whole grains per day could reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Whole grains are packed with dietary fibre, B vitamins, magnesium, and plant compounds that promote healthy digestion and metabolism. The fibre content helps control cholesterol and blood sugar levels, while antioxidants reduce inflammation in the arteries. Together, these mechanisms improve heart function and support long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: Replacing refined carbohydrates like white rice or white bread with brown rice, oats, or whole-wheat chapatis is a simple way to increase whole-grain intake. Even small, consistent changes over time can have a measurable effect on overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Regular nut consumption has also been linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and inflammation-related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Nuts are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that help reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) while maintaining HDL (good cholesterol). They also contain magnesium, selenium, and antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress, one of the key factors in ageing and heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: A handful of unsalted nuts as a snack or as a topping on salads, yoghurt, or breakfast cereals provides an easy daily boost. Studies show that even moderate intake a few times per week contributes to cardiovascular protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

An optimal mix of two fruits and three vegetables per day has been associated with the strongest protective effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Fruits and vegetables contain compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols that protect cells from oxidative damage. Their potassium and fibre content also support heart health by regulating blood pressure and improving digestion. Additionally, these foods help maintain a healthy weight by providing nutrients with minimal calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: Aim for at least five servings daily, preferably of different colours leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, berries, citrus, and seasonal produce. Fresh and lightly cooked options retain the most nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why these foods matter for longevity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus suggests that no single food guarantees a longer life. However, consistent dietary patterns that prioritise plant-based, minimally processed foods, such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets, have shown measurable benefits in lowering the risk of premature death. Whole grains, nuts, and fruits and vegetables are common elements across these diets. They provide nutrients that reduce inflammation, improve metabolic function, and support healthy ageing at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, replacing refined or processed foods with these nutrient-dense options has a cumulative positive effect. Over decades, even small dietary improvements can significantly impact longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical tips for everyday eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;: Choose oatmeal, whole-grain toast, or millet porridge instead of refined cereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack smart&lt;/strong&gt;: Replace chips or sweets with a small portion of nuts or seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill half your plate with plants&lt;/strong&gt;: Include a mix of cooked and raw vegetables in every meal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay consistent&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term habits matter more than short-term diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 15:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>法里达巴德肺病学家分享如何逆转空气污染和吸烟造成的肺损伤： “快步走或运动……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/faridabad-pulmonologist-shares-how-to-reverse-lung-damage-from-air-pollution-and-smoking-brisk-walking-or-exercise-101762008565947.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/faridabad-pulmonologist-shares-how-to-reverse-lung-damage-from-air-pollution-and-smoking-brisk-walking-or-exercise-101762008565947.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our lungs are among the most vital organs, silently working to keep us alive.

This causes swelling, reduces oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, and leads to breathlessness over time. It also affects blood vessels, contributing to heart attacks, strokes, and other systemic health problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even non-smokers aren’t safe. “Living in highly polluted areas can be equivalent to smoking 20–30 cigarettes a day,” Dr Chabbra warns. “Airborne toxins accelerate lung ageing, increase the risk of COPD, and may lead to lung cancer over time.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/g4986ec0bb32ef2c63c78da65caf7da186f0d0c094534ee07019fe42a82bc0f1fd3219e7c39ab040197bb748a29daedb051e31078c15e30b95ccda54611ba26d6_1280_1762009608515.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)" title="Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common causes of lung damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chabbra highlights key contributors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains thousands of harmful chemicals, causing DNA damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pollution: &lt;/strong&gt;Vehicle emissions, industrial smoke, and cooking fuels emit particles that penetrate lung tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Asbestos, silica, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase risk in industrial workers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing exposure to these major causes is essential for lung health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tips to help recover lung health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some damage may be permanent, Dr Chabbra explains that certain lifestyle changes can help restore lung function and prevent further damage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Quit smoking immediately – the first and most crucial step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Exercise regularly – brisk walking or light aerobic activity helps clear mucus and boost lung capacity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Improve indoor air quality – use HEPA air purifiers, proper ventilation, and avoid exposure during peak pollution hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Eat a nutritious, antioxidant-rich diet – fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, beetroot, garlic, and green tea help tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. Stay hydrated – adequate water intake helps thin mucus and flush toxins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Practice breathing exercises or yoga – techniques like Pranayama strengthen &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/noida-pulmonologist-shares-simple-tips-to-protect-your-eyes-and-lungs-from-post-diwali-air-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-101761381316121.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lungs"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt; and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/Screenshot_2025-11-01_204906_1762010366267.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Chabbra emphasises that vaccinations and regular health checks are vital for lung health.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. Vaccination – flu and pneumonia shots protect against infections that could further harm the lungs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. Regular health check-ups – especially for those over 40 or with a smoking history. Low-dose CT scans can detect early-stage lung cancer or other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In severe cases, a lung transplant may be the only option,” notes Dr Chabbra. “But early detection and proper care can significantly improve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preventing further damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution and smoking cause persistent damage,” Dr Chabbra emphasises. “The only way to protect your lungs is to quit smoking and minimise exposure to harmful pollutants.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds practical tips for everyday protection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a properly fitted N95 mask in high-pollution areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors and keep windows and doors closed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid biomass fuels like wood, coal, cow dung, or kerosene in poorly ventilated spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of diet, exercise and hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating antioxidant-rich foods, practising yoga, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated all support &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/pulmonologist-shares-5-tips-to-boost-lung-health-practice-deep-breathing-stay-physically-active-101757568840127.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lung health"&gt;lung health&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr Chabbra. “Hydration keeps mucus thin, making it easier to expel toxins and improving overall respiratory efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these steps consistently, lung health can improve, breathlessness can be reduced, and the risk of further complications can be minimised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astringency is a dry, puckering, rough, or sandpapery sensation in the mouth caused by plant-derived polyphenols. Polyphenols, including flavanols, are well known for risk reduction in cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Flavanols, found abundantly in cocoa, red wine, and berries, are associated with improved memory and cognition, as well as protection against neuronal damage. Despite these benefits, flavanols have poor bioavailability—the fraction that actually enters the bloodstream after ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has left an important knowledge gap: how can flavanols influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; and the nervous system when so little of them is absorbed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, a research team led by Dr. Yasuyuki Fujii and Professor Naomi Osakabe from Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan, investigated how flavanols affect the nervous system through sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2025.101195" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Current Research in Food Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tested the hypothesis that the astringent taste of flavanols may act as a direct signal to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Flavanols exhibit an astringent taste. We hypothesized that this taste serves as a stimulus, transmitting signals directly to the central nervous system (comprising the brain and spinal cord). As a result, it is thought that flavanol stimulation is transmitted via &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+nerves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory nerves&lt;/a&gt; to activate the brain, subsequently inducing physiological responses in the periphery through the sympathetic nervous system," explains Dr. Fujii.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted experiments in 10-week-old mice, administering flavanols orally at doses of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg body weight, while control mice received only distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral tests showed that flavanol-fed mice exhibited greater motor activity, exploratory behavior, and improved learning and memory compared to controls. Flavanols enhanced neurotransmitter activity across several brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and its precursor levodopa, norepinephrine and its metabolite normetanephrine were elevated in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline network immediately after the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chemicals regulate motivation, attention, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;, and arousal. Furthermore, enzymes critical for noradrenaline synthesis (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tyrosine+hydroxylase/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tyrosine hydroxylase&lt;/a&gt; and dopamine-β-hydroxylase) and transport (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) were upregulated, strengthening the signaling capacity of the noradrenergic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, biochemical analysis revealed higher urinary levels of catecholamines—hormones released during stress—as well as increased activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a brain region central to stress regulation. Flavanol administration also boosted the expression of c-Fos (a key transcription factor) and corticotropin-releasing hormone in the PVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these results demonstrate that flavanol intake can trigger wide-ranging physiological responses resembling those induced by exercise—functioning as a moderate stressor that activates the central nervous system and enhances attention, arousal, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stress responses elicited by flavanols in this study are similar to those elicited by physical exercise. Thus, moderate intake of flavanols, despite their poor bioavailability, can improve the health and quality of life," said Dr. Fujii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have potential implications in the field of sensory nutrition. In particular, next-generation foods can be developed based on the sensory properties, physiological effects, and palatability of foods.&lt;/p&gt;
