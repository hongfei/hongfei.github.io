The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health – it's a long laundry list," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. "And two metrics of climate change – the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures – are resulting in greater amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions "business as usual" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature – but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us," says Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Of course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice&lt;/a&gt; – so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, this is "one of the most comprehensive studies" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study.

They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. "That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe," Ziska says. "But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil." In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(04)00173-6" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;reactions with other minerals in the soil&lt;/a&gt; that make the arsenic more bioavailable and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01035.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;easier for the rice plants to absorb&lt;/a&gt; through their root systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own," Ziska says. It &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b02970" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;changes the microbiome of the soil&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. "This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active," Ziska says. "It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ziska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/document/&amp;amp;deid=363892" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment&lt;/a&gt; of inorganic arsenic's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;"cancer potency factor"&lt;/a&gt;, taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that "arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://publications.iarc.fr/120" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;risk of skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung and bladder cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For individuals, the risks are slight. For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the latest EPA review&lt;/a&gt; found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day – or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person – would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-88ce25f0-0 hKyLjB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-1 fWLEJY"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-88ce25f0-3 KoeIS"&gt;Inorganic arsenic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-2 fTeQYN"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-4 jYFeys"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the EPA calculates&lt;/a&gt; that – compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic – an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say.

In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown," Ziska says.

                Many over-the-counter pain medications are available, but are they all the same? And how much should you really take?

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When hit with a headache or fever, people often &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(22)00079-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;reach for over-the-counter painkillers&lt;/a&gt; like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as their first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Used correctly, these drugs can be safe and effective for pain relief. That means following the instructions on the label and the advice of a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's not how we take these medications in real life," says &lt;a href="https://www.trishapasricha.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trisha Pasricha&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Some people take too much pain medication too quickly, misdiagnose an ailment and take the wrong drug, or unknowingly take multiple pain relievers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pds.4391#:~:text=15%25%20of%20adult%20ibuprofen%20users,more%20than%201%20usage%20occasion" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2018, for example, found that 15% of over 1,300 survey participants exceeded daily NSAID dosages, and most participants didn't recognize that all the products they were taking were NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These behaviors can lead to serious side effects, from bloating and nausea all the way up to heart attack and stroke, Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent these risks, the health care professionals we spoke to for this story say it's important to get to know the painkillers in your medicine cabinet. Here are 10 things they wish you knew about these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers&lt;/strong&gt;, says University of California San Francisco (UCSF) clinical pharmacist &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/candy-tsourounis" target="_blank"&gt;Candy Tsourounis&lt;/a&gt;. Commonly known as Tylenol, it's thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than NSAIDs are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. NSAIDs are generally considered more effective than acetaminophen for pain relief&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says, especially for inflammatory pain like muscle aches. While acetaminophen is thought to work only on the central nervous system, NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (like Aleve) work throughout the body to reduce inflammation, pain and fever.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Taking too much acetaminophen at one time or too many doses close together can cause liver damage&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says. So stick to 3,000 milligrams of the drug at most per day, and don't mix it with alcohol, which is also hard on the liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. NSAIDs carry risks to the gut and the heart.&lt;/strong&gt; Common side effects include stomach pain, heartburn and bloating. You can also experience more serious damage like ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage if you take NSAIDs at too high a dose or even just for too long a time period, Pasricha says. And non-aspirin NSAIDs have the potential to raise your blood pressure. Every NSAID has a different max dose, so pay attention to your labels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you're not sure which painkiller to use or how much to take, talk to a pharmacist&lt;/strong&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blamoh-twegbe/" target="_blank"&gt;Blamoh Twegbe&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacy manager at UCSF outpatient pharmacy. "Please utilize us. That's what we're here for!" They can help you make an informed decision by asking about your type of pain and chronic conditions and by checking any potential drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. There's a limit to how much pain NSAIDs can treat&lt;/strong&gt;, Pasricha says. If you take more than the recommended dosage or more than one type of NSAID at once — for example, combining Motrin and Aleve — you're increasing your risk of side effects without getting any additional pain relief. If you feel your over-the-counter (OTC) drugs aren't working, talk to a doctor or pharmacist instead of ignoring the warning label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58991" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;
            
&lt;div class="credit-caption"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-wrap"&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption" aria-label="Image caption"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                If you're regularly taking the same over-the-counter pain medications, talk to your doctor about alternatives that can better address your symptoms.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. If you're habitually reaching for the same OTC pain medication, talk to your health care provider.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you're taking naproxen every day of your period every month because of muscle cramps. Pasricha says that pain might signal a larger underlying health&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;problem that could be better treated with prescription medication, lifestyle changes or both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Beware of accidentally overmedicating with a combination OTC drugs. &lt;/strong&gt;Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often included in a lot of other sick-day remedies, like migraine medication, allergy pills or all-in-one cold and flu medicines, Twegbe says. So when you're not feeling well, double-check your labels before assuming you need a dose of Tylenol on top of those cold-relief meds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59002" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Alternate between NSAIDs and acetaminophen to manage major pain and reduce side effects. &lt;/strong&gt;If you're suffering from the flu or nursing a new injury and need strong and steady pain relief, switching between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen every few hours can be a safe and effective way to help you cope until your symptoms subside, Twegbe says. Just make sure to follow recommended dosages and dosing times for each medication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Think beyond pills.&lt;/strong&gt;  Because over-the-counter pain relievers are so readily available, people often forget that pills aren't the only option when suffering from minor aches and pains, Pasricha says. Many NSAIDs and other analgesics are available in topical form, like creams or patches, and can offer similar relief without the potential side effects to your gut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also nonmedication remedies, like heating pads to ease back pain or exercising in water for arthritis. Talk to your doctor about your alternatives, Pasricha says. "They might even control your pain more reliably than just taking medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s framed as this mental health advice, but it feels like it all boils down to being a kind of the best version of yourself, and that feels inherently capitalist, inherently individualistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But don’t they want to see friends at a pub or a club?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s expensive,” Isabel says. “I mean, my gym subscription is £28, and I can drop that in a flash on a birthday pub event at a London pub, especially where the pints are like almost £7.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Helen also visits charity worker &lt;strong&gt;Niyi Akinseye&lt;/strong&gt; at a gym in central London, where he works out for four hours a day. He’s made friends at the gym, but wishes that their generation were more connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I often reflect that I see people in the gym more than I see my mum or any family member, but you don’t say hello to them. You just walk past them awkwardly. And I think that’s what I’ve really encouraged myself to break down, to do, to actually get to know the people you see every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“History is one of my passions outside of fitness. One of my favourite periods of time is, for example, the French Revolution. And a lot of those ideas were formed by young people going in pubs and discussing ideas. And I think there’s definitely something missed by people of our generation not meeting more and actually discussing the real issues that are going on in society right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Support the Guardian today: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77a2b0cf-6df3-48b9-93da-8c9c91e08ab6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This last one was a kind of fix-it job from the guy that did it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked like Quasimodo, because I had one eye here, one eye there. It was wicked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She later claimed that the botched procedure had scared her off getting anymore &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/cosmetic-surgery/index.html" id="mol-d8b57090-984c-11ee-9b8b-1fd3a653f350"&gt;cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt; done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon has also said another facelift in 2019 left her looking like Elvis doing his trademark snarl, as it involved lifting her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The year 1999 saw her lose over 100 pounds through a gastric band operation and she revealed she had spent $120,000 on a facelift, tummy tuck, eye lift, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox as well at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon also admitted in 2007 that she had spent approximately £300,000 - which at the time equated to about $530,000 US on cosmetic surgeries and enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TV host has had various tummy tucks, a breast reduction, vaginal cosmetic surgery and got a double mastectomy in 2012 after learning about her risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elsewhere, Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker has been candid about how she has treated her feet over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In another instance, fifty-nine year old Brooke Shields is another A-lister whose feet show regular signs of ageing whereas her face has maintained a breathtaking signature youthful glow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;However, in 2023, the star explained that while she got Botox in the past, she's decided to embrace her natural beauty as she ages because she's 'scared' of 'over doing it' and ending up 'not looking like herself'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Sarah has recently opened up about never getting plastic surgery - and jokingly lamented that she 'missed the boat' on getting a facelift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the actress's glowing skin and smooth facial features suggest that she has taken the time to take care of her visage, perhaps with cosmetics and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking about her routine in 2023, the actress, 60, revealed to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/roc-skincare-sarah-jessica-parker-look-forward-project-1235758696/"&gt;WWD &lt;/a&gt;that she uses a &lt;span&gt;serum, eye balm and SPF from Roc's Revive + Glow range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the star has in past spoken about how she hasn't been as kind to her feet, after becoming as known as her Sex and the City character, Carrie Bradshaw, for sporting a pair of &lt;font&gt;Manolo Blahnik heels. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;In 2013, she she admitted that her passion for high heels has caused permanent damage to her feet - and she'd had to go cold turkey as a result.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;'For ten or so years, I literally ran in heels,' she told e-tailer &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.net-a-porter.com/magazine#%21/185/10"&gt;Net-a-Porter&lt;/a&gt;'s digital fashion magazine.

One day I said, "Do you think I should put Botox in my face?" And [Dr. Rosenberg] looked at me and he goes, "I thought this day would never come," the mother-of-three recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I was like "Oh my God, I needed Botox"…there's a sweet spot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the mother-of-three insisted that her Botox use is 'super minimal' and that she only has it injected in a few areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm a minimalist…I do the crow's feet and I do the neck and that's it. I do it now three times a year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly is also a huge skincare advocate and often uses topical products to help minimise signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another instance, fifty-nine year old Brooke Shields is another A-lister whose feet show regular signs of ageing whereas her face has maintained a breathtaking signature youthful glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in 2023, the star explained that while she got &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/botox/index.html" id="mol-aec26860-7a51-11ee-8322-4f7f58a6d4aa"&gt;Botox&lt;/a&gt; in the past, she's decided to embrace her natural beauty as she ages because she's 'scared' of 'over doing it' and ending up 'not looking like herself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The actress and model opened up about why she's not interested in getting plastic surgery during a chat with &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.glamour.com/story/brooke-shields-glamour-women-of-the-year-2023"&gt;Glamour &lt;/a&gt;magazine for its US Woman of the Year issue, explaining that she 'doesn't want to chase youth,' but instead, 'chase the now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that while she's not against women going under the knife if they're doing it 'for the right reasons,' it's not for her personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while she's 'seen it give women such confidence,' she admitted that it did just the opposite for her when she received Botox injections in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am all for any of it if it truly is done for yourself, for the right reasons, and gives you a level of some kind of confidence that you need,' said the Blue Lagoon alum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Listen, I’ve seen it give women such confidence. But I think it’s easy to go down the slope of overdoing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m scared of not looking like myself. The times that I’ve had Botox, I end up with this Spock eye and I’m like, "I don’t look like myself."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Brooke is not a fan of injectables or surgery, she said she does love to 'try the newest' skin regimens, like Fraxel - a 'non-invasive' laser treatment 'for people who want to look younger without dramatic changes,' according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'll get Fraxels and peels, or whatever the newest thing is, I’ll try it. I just don’t want to not look like myself,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There’s more and more plastic surgery than ever. Because [people are] chasing youth. I don’t want to chase youth. I want to chase now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brooke has long been open about her fears over plastic surgery and has continuously insisted that she's never gone under the knife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2019, when asked by host Andy Cohen if she had gotten any surgical procedures during an episode of Watch What Happens Live, Brooke said, 'No, I have not done a thing to my face. I'm afraid of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Donatella Versace is among the other stars whose feet show a contrast to her glam face - and she has recently stunned her fans with a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14153065/donatella-versace-stuns-fans-beauty-transformation.html#"&gt;jaw-dropping transformation. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The iconic Italian fashion designer, 69, looked younger than ever while attending The Devil Wears Prada musical launch in London in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sister of the late Gianni Versace, the founder of the luxury fashion house Versace, showed off her taut visage while posing for the cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many fans even joked that she went to '&lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/lindsay-lohan/index.html" id="mol-078a9470-b1ee-11ef-b95f-091ef1b68d09" class=""&gt;Lindsay Lohan&lt;/a&gt;'s doctor' as they compared her to the Mean Girls actress, who also underwent a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14100135/Lindsay-Lohan-changing-appearance-youthful-transformation.html"&gt;major beauty transformation &lt;/a&gt;recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not the first time the businesswoman — known for her platinum blonde hair extensions and big lashes — sparked plastic surgery rumors with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-2822755/How-Donatella-Versace-transformed-human-waxwork-Botox-implants-laser-resurfacing.html"&gt;her dramatic makeovers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elsewhere, Victoria Beckham, 51, is a model and fashion powerhouse known for her beaming complexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the model has been open about how her feet have been affected after years of wearing six-inch stilettos have taken their painful toll on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2009, a source told the Mail: 'The Beckham household is all about feetat the moment: David is having painkilling injections for bone bruisingon his foot, while Victoria is in agony with her misshapen feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She is suffering from shooting pain from the bunions.Normally, she kicks off her shoes in the house, but she has been out somuch recently in high heels that she is really feeling it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Victoria had insisted she will not resort to flat shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I beyond hate ballerina flats,' she said in previous interviews.

That’s because high cholesterol can be caused by different things, including your genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"High cholesterol is very common, but most people don't know they have it because it doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why everyone should have a &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol/getting-a-cholesterol-test" rel="nofollow"&gt;cholesterol check.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart UK explains when you have too much cholesterol it damages your arteries. It says: "Fatty areas known as plaques can form, and these become harder with time, making the arteries stiffer and narrower. This process is called atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When the arteries become narrower, it’s harder for blood to flow through them. This puts a strain on your heart because it has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Eventually, the heart can become weak and can’t work as well as it should.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Blood clots can form over the fatty, hardened parts of the arteries (plaques). The blood clots can block the artery completely, cutting off the blood flow. Bits of the blood clots can break away and become lodged in an artery or vein in another part of the body, which can cause a heart attack or stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But experts at Heart UK say there are things you can do to both cut your cholesterol levels now if they are already high - or reduce the chance of getting them in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;It has drawn up a list of foods&lt;/a&gt; that can help cut high cholesterol - and set out exactly how much you should have of each every day to get the best benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It says: "There are several foods which are not just part of a healthy diet, they can actively help to lower your cholesterol too. Try to eat some of these every day as part of your healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The more you add them to what you eat, the more they can help lower your cholesterol, especially if you cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fa&lt;/a&gt; t as well." This is what they recommend: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foods rich in unsaturated fats&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with unsaturated fats is great way to lower your cholesterol, says the charity. Foods which contain &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;vegetable oils such as olive, sunflower, corn, rapeseed, nut and seed oils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;avocado, nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fat spreads made from vegetable oils, such as sunflower and olive oil&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim to eat two portions of fish per week, at least one of which should be oily.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The experts say: "Oily fish are a good source of healthy unsaturated fats, specifically a type called &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A portion is 140g, but you could have two or three smaller portions throughout the week. Tinned, frozen or fresh all count e.g. salmon, sardines, pilchards, trout, herring and mackerel."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it warns to avoid coconut and palm oil as, unlike other vegetable oils, they are high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The experts explain: "They contain vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals which help you to stay healthy, and most contain little or no fat and are low in calories, so they can help you to stay a healthy weight. And, if you are eating more fruit and veg, chances are you're eating less of the other more energy-packed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Fruit and vegetables are also high in fibre, and some types of fibre can help to lower your cholesterol. It blocks some cholesterol from being absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good choices include pulses such as beans, peas and lentils as they are particularly high in this kind of fibre. Others include sweet potato, aubergine, okra (ladies’ fingers), broccoli, apples, strawberries and prunes are also good options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can be fresh, tinned, frozen or dried. however if you opt for tinned choose those in juice or water, without added sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However some fruit and vegetables are not included when it comes to getting your five-a-day. Potatoes, yams, cassava and plantains count as a starchy food, like rice or pasta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;while unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are included but count only as one portion. The charity says: "More than one doesn’t count because the loose sugar and acid in them can damage your teeth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;You should aim for at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An adult portion is around 80g, or a handful. Make at least one of these beans, peas or lentils. Other options include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons of vegetables – such as sweet potato, broccoli or okra&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; 3 tablespoons of beans, peas or lentils – all options count, for example chickpeas, kidney beans, garden peas and red lentils &lt;br&gt; 2-3 cauliflower or broccoli florets &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; half a large vegetable – such as courgette, pepper or aubergine &lt;br&gt; half an avocado &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a medium sized vegetable – such as a turnip, parsnip, sweet potato, leek, tomato or carrot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a medium sized fruit – for example, an apple, orange or banana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 small fruits – such as plums or satsumas&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of berries or grapes – and other small fruits like strawberries and prunes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a good-sized slice of a larger fruit – such as a melon, mango or pineapple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a tablespoon of dried fruit&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a 150ml glass of fruit juice&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of salad&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foods with added sterols and stanols&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sterols and stanols are plant chemicals which are a similar size and shape to cholesterol. Heart UK explains how they work saying: "They are absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream and block some cholesterol from being absorbed, lowering the cholesterol in your blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We get a small amount of sterols from plant-based foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, but it’s not enough to lower cholesterol. So, food companies have developed foods with plant sterols or stanols added to them, such as mini yogurt drinks, fat spreads, milk and yogurts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These fortified foods lower your cholesterol gradually, over a few weeks, and how much depends on the amount you eat. Some experts believe they are the most effective single food for lowering cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While both sterols and stanols have been thoroughly researched, so they can be added to foods and are safe to eat some people cannot have them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are suitable for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;People with high cholesterol – there’s no real benefit if you don’t have high cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children with inherited high cholesterol such as familial hypercholesterolaemia – with support from a doctor or dietitian.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People taking statins – sterols and stanols will help to lower your cholesterol further because they work in a different way to the statin.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are not suitable for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children who do not have an inherited condition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They won’t have much effect if you are taking Ezetrol (Ezetimibe) because they both work in a similar way.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: one to three servings of fortified foods a day - you can get this by either:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;three servings of 2tsp fat spread&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;one 115g yoghurt&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;one fortified yoghurt mini-drink&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will give you 1.5 to 3g of stanols and sterols.&lt;/span&gt; Over three weeks, this could lower your cholesterol by up to 10%. There’s no extra benefit to having more than 3g a day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health UK advises: "To get the most from these foods, eat some every day and eat them with a meal rather than on their own. Look out for products labelled ‘fortified with stanols or sterols’. They can be branded, such as the Flora ProActiv and Benecol ranges, as well as supermarket own products."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;b&gt;Oats and barley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oats and barley are grains which are rich in a type of fibre called beta glucan. The experts say: "Eating 3g of beta-glucan a day as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle can help to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When you eat beta glucan, it forms a gel which binds to cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestines. This helps limit the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed from the gut into your blood. Your liver then has to take more cholesterol out of your blood to make more bile, which lowers your blood cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: three servings of the following oat-based products or barley per day to give you about 3g of beta glucans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of porridge – which is 30g of dry oats or a sachet of instant porridge&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of oat-based breakfast cereal flakes – around 30-35g&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;250 ml of Oat Drink containing beta-glucans (not all oat drinks contain beta-glucan so check to make sure)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 breakfast cereal oat type ‘biscuit’&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1-2 tbsp (13g) oatbran – try sprinkling it onto cereals or adding it to casseroles, stews, soups and smoothies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 oatcakes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;30g oats added to recipes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;75g cooked pearl barley – try adding it to stews, casseroles and soups&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "Many products now contain oats, which makes it easier to get your two to four servings. Foods which have a claim on the label saying they lower cholesterol will contain 1g or more of beta glucan."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nuts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nuts are a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; and are lower in &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, a mix which can help to keep your cholesterol in check. Heart UK says: "They contain fibre which can help block some cholesterol being absorbed into the blood stream from the gut, as well as protein, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, natural plant &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods#sterolsandstanols" rel="nofollow"&gt;sterols&lt;/a&gt; and other plant nutrients which help keep your body healthy. They’re also filling, so you’re less likely to snack on other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: 28-30g of nuts a day, which is around a handful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "All nuts count. Choose a variety and eat them instead of your normal snack or as part of a meal. Where possible, go for the kind with their skins still intact as they contain more nutrients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good options are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;almonds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;macadamias&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brazil nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cashew nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;hazelnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pistachios&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;walnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;peanuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pecans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Soya foods&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soya beans and the foods that are made from them are perfect for a heart-healthy diet, advises Heart UK. "They’re full of protein, vitamins and minerals, and they're low in saturated fat. Soya products are a good option for replacing foods which are high in saturated fat such as meat, full fat cream and dairy products, and snacks such as crisps."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: around two to three servings of soya a foods day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One serving is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a large glass (250ml) of soya milk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g plain soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g Greek-style soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g soya mince&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of soya nuts (35g) – also known as roasted edamame beans, you’ll find them in the nuts and snacks section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edamame beans, about 120g – you’ll find them in the frozen foods section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g tofu – silken or firm&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxT9IBhgFBVV95cUxQS25RclFYZVlTTW5GeGFMTHZtZlctcERyVzJwTUFwLTJMOHdSNGw2Z1JMRWROVGRQdW9ybHZxcEdmbkxpQ2R0NXRNcE9ibXJELUt3cUdVNHppcGhRdFRHRXhpamlkbnFQRUdRVUwyNEduaTF5SWZoeUoxTDBtcEFSeW5FZHRVQQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，通过每天吃六种食物来降低高胆固醇- Surrey Live | Heart expert says cut high cholesterol by eating six foods every day - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cholesterol is vital in our blood to stay healthy too much can lead to serious health problems - some potentially fatal. &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; figures show around 59% of people have raised cholesterol levels putting them at &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;higher risk of heart problems or having a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to cholesterol charity Heart UK too much cholesterol in your blood can be laid down in the walls of your arteries – the large blood vessels that carry blood around your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It advises: "Anyone can have high cholesterol, even if you are young, slim, eat well and exercise. That’s because high cholesterol can be caused by different things, including your genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"High cholesterol is very common, but most people don't know they have it because it doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why everyone should have a &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol/getting-a-cholesterol-test" rel="nofollow"&gt;cholesterol check.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart UK explains when you have too much cholesterol it damages your arteries. It says: "Fatty areas known as plaques can form, and these become harder with time, making the arteries stiffer and narrower. This process is called atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When the arteries become narrower, it’s harder for blood to flow through them. This puts a strain on your heart because it has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Eventually, the heart can become weak and can’t work as well as it should.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Blood clots can form over the fatty, hardened parts of the arteries (plaques). The blood clots can block the artery completely, cutting off the blood flow. Bits of the blood clots can break away and become lodged in an artery or vein in another part of the body, which can cause a heart attack or stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But experts at Heart UK say there are things you can do to both cut your cholesterol levels now if they are already high - or reduce the chance of getting them in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;It has drawn up a list of foods&lt;/a&gt; that can help cut high cholesterol - and set out exactly how much you should have of each every day to get the best benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It says: "There are several foods which are not just part of a healthy diet, they can actively help to lower your cholesterol too. Try to eat some of these every day as part of your healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The more you add them to what you eat, the more they can help lower your cholesterol, especially if you cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fa&lt;/a&gt; t as well."

Your liver then has to take more cholesterol out of your blood to make more bile, which lowers your blood cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: three servings of the following oat-based products or barley per day to give you about 3g of beta glucans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of porridge – which is 30g of dry oats or a sachet of instant porridge&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of oat-based breakfast cereal flakes – around 30-35g&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;250 ml of Oat Drink containing beta-glucans (not all oat drinks contain beta-glucan so check to make sure)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 breakfast cereal oat type ‘biscuit’&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1-2 tbsp (13g) oatbran – try sprinkling it onto cereals or adding it to casseroles, stews, soups and smoothies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 oatcakes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;30g oats added to recipes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;75g cooked pearl barley – try adding it to stews, casseroles and soups&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "Many products now contain oats, which makes it easier to get your two to four servings. Foods which have a claim on the label saying they lower cholesterol will contain 1g or more of beta glucan."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nuts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nuts are a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; and are lower in &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, a mix which can help to keep your cholesterol in check. Heart UK says: "They contain fibre which can help block some cholesterol being absorbed into the blood stream from the gut, as well as protein, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, natural plant &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods#sterolsandstanols" rel="nofollow"&gt;sterols&lt;/a&gt; and other plant nutrients which help keep your body healthy. They’re also filling, so you’re less likely to snack on other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: 28-30g of nuts a day, which is around a handful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "All nuts count. Choose a variety and eat them instead of your normal snack or as part of a meal. Where possible, go for the kind with their skins still intact as they contain more nutrients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good options are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;almonds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;macadamias&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brazil nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cashew nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;hazelnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pistachios&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;walnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;peanuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pecans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Soya foods&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soya beans and the foods that are made from them are perfect for a heart-healthy diet, advises Heart UK. "They’re full of protein, vitamins and minerals, and they're low in saturated fat. Soya products are a good option for replacing foods which are high in saturated fat such as meat, full fat cream and dairy products, and snacks such as crisps."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: around two to three servings of soya a foods day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One serving is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a large glass (250ml) of soya milk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g plain soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g Greek-style soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g soya mince&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of soya nuts (35g) – also known as roasted edamame beans, you’ll find them in the nuts and snacks section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edamame beans, about 120g – you’ll find them in the frozen foods section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g tofu – silken or firm&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxTw</guid></item><item><title>这种锻炼错误可能会伤害您的睡眠并使您感觉更糟- AOL.com | This workout mistake could hurt your sleep and make you feel worse - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE0xZ2FrQlVJdVgyYUZnRHNibWxlSFlWMHVUZjl1QVphckhLVmVIMjc1Z1pHT3hwai1wWGg1X0xaYThwZXUyOGctaXd5NmJWbXpJZ2NBRkFkTWhBOWxaRklwa2NtLXpQNHBMTC1JbHhleXBvMVI4UUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you prefer waking up early to start your day with a workout, or relieving the day’s stress by &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/03/28/top-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-to-stay-fit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hitting the gym;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hitting the gym&lt;/a&gt; after work?

                                &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU (Island News) – The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a new travel-related case of dengue virus on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total number of dengue cases in the state have been raised to seven in 2025 with one on Maui and six reported on Oahu. The affected person in the current case was reportedly exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials state that the case is unrelated to the dengue cases that were reported on April 10 and 11 of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who plans to travel to or has recently visited a place with dengue risk is vulnerable to infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are reminding travelers to take the standard precautions when visiting such areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a year-round risk and appears in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, Asia (including the Republic of the Philippines), the Middle East, Africa and several Pacific Islands, such as U.S. territories like America Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. Many popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, are also affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers returning from dengue-endemic areas should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks. If dengue symptoms develop within two weeks of return, travelers should seek medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries are reporting increased dengue cases, including Fiji, French Polynesia, Tonga, the Republic of the Philippines, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers should review up-to-date country-specific travel information for guidance on dengue risk and prevention measures at least four to six weeks before traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here for more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-article  subscriber-hide tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-article tnt-inline-relation-sibling tnt-inline-presentation-summary tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;article id="card-summary-5fabd24a-d2bb-4f16-a88e-8944c4731742" class="tnt-asset-type-article clearfix card summary has-image  letterbox-style-blur  tnt-section-news tnt-sub-section-local"&gt;

This study explored whether these popular beverages could lower the risk of head and neck cancer, a group of diseases that includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may give hope to millions of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-links-coffee-to-cancer-heart-disease-and-parkinsons-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and tea drinkers worldwide. The findings suggest that drinking coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, and even tea in certain amounts, may be linked to lower chances of developing certain types of head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Global Look at a Growing Cancer Concern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head and neck cancers are now the seventh most common type of cancer around the world. These cancers are becoming more frequent, especially in low- and middle-income countries. As more people are affected, scientists are working harder to understand how lifestyle choices might influence cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;New research suggests that daily coffee consumption may help lower the risk of head and neck cancers. (CREDIT: Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, studies on coffee and tea’s impact on these cancers have had mixed results. Some showed promise, while others found no clear link. To get a better picture, researchers from around the world came together to reanalyze a large amount of data. The team, led by the &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah&lt;/a&gt;, reviewed 14 different studies gathered by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group looked at information from nearly 25,000 people. Of these, 9,548 had head and neck cancer, and 15,783 did not. Participants answered detailed questions about how much coffee and tea they drank over time. This included whether the coffee was regular or decaffeinated and how often they consumed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What the Study Revealed About Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear trend: people who drank more than four cups of caffeinated coffee per day had lower odds of getting head and neck cancer. Specifically, these individuals had: 17% lower odds of developing any type of head and neck cancer, 30% lower odds of developing cancer of the mouth, and 22% lower odds of developing throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more striking, those who drank three to four cups daily had a 41% lower risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. This is a rare but serious type of cancer that starts at the bottom part of the throat, near the voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even decaffeinated coffee seemed to offer benefits. People who drank decaf had 25% lower odds of getting oral cavity cancer. This finding is important because it suggests that something other than &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/coffee-and-caffeine-consumption-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;—possibly antioxidants or other plant-based compounds in coffee—might be helping protect cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tea's Role in Cancer Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea also showed some promise, especially when it came to hypopharyngeal cancer. People who drank tea had 29% lower odds of getting this type of cancer. Those who drank one cup or less per day had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Study-specific odds ratios for &amp;gt;4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily versus non–coffee drinkers for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the relationship between tea and cancer risk wasn’t all positive. Drinking more than one cup of tea daily was linked with a 38% higher chance of developing laryngeal cancer, which affects the voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surprising result shows that the effects of tea might vary depending on how much is consumed and which part of the head or neck is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What These Findings Mean&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there has been prior research on coffee and tea consumption and reduced risk of cancer, this study highlighted their varying effects with different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, including the observation that even decaffeinated coffee had some positive impact,” said Yuan-Chin Amy Lee, the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like these kind of stories?

People drink them in many different ways—some with milk or &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/groundbreaking-sugar-treatment-could-cure-180700479.html" data-ylk="slk:sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, some plain, and in different amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These habits might influence how coffee or tea affects the body. “These findings support the need for more data and further studies around the impact that coffee and tea can have on reducing cancer risk,” Lee added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't prove that coffee or tea prevents cancer. But it does suggest that these beverages could play a role in lowering the risk for some people. The research also helps show how different types of head and neck cancer may respond differently to substances found in these drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Takeaways for Everyday Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who drinks coffee or tea, this study offers some good news. While more research is needed, moderate coffee drinking could be linked with lower chances of developing certain cancers of the head and neck. Even decaf coffee might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Characteristics of head and neck cancer cases and controls of select INHANCE consortium studies. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tea, a cup a day might help protect against some cancers, but more than that could raise the risk for others. This suggests a careful balance is needed. The kind of tea, how it’s made, and what’s added to it could all play a role in how it affects your &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/study-challenges-health-benefits-standing-160700589.html" data-ylk="slk:health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, no single food or drink can fully protect you from cancer. But understanding how common habits influence health is a key part of cancer prevention. These new findings may encourage more people to look at how everyday choices—like what you drink—could add up over time to support better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

TNBC is more invasive and has a higher risk of recurrence than other breast cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M4VVP3BD7BHKLBCWHN3Q2N4TPA"&gt;Generally speaking, linoleic acid is an essential nutrient needed to build cell membranes, protect skin, and support heart health. However, the study notes that since the 1950s, linoleic acid consumption has increased significantly as cooking oils have become commonplace in fried and ultra-processed foods. These findings are believed to be the first to raise concerns about the fatty acid’s potential link to disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C4XMK2O7IVBW3K7ZTU6JFBD434"&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said Dr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine, to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/lifestyle/cooking-oil-linked-to-aggressive-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/lifestyle/cooking-oil-linked-to-aggressive-breast-cancer/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;. He explained this study was significant as it “sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit from specific nutritional recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C6C3NTJKMJH6JNJAVPBQVF5KCY"&gt;However, he noted that this research shouldn’t make people fearful of linoleic acid. “The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals,” he said. He further stressed that “a balanced, whole food diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3DYYUZOYHNBBJFI6LK7H5CHMNY"&gt;As for what vegetable and seed oils are high in linoleic acid, sunflower oil, corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil all make the list. Linoleic acid is also found in nuts, seeds, meats and eggs but in much smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Syracuse.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员确认夏威夷今年第7例登革热病例-檀香山Star-Advertiser | Health officials confirm Hawaii’s 7th dengue case this year - Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxObFlQSVdPb1hsNk45MjQxSHZkS3V2dkFXYldfZklrdjdkZXlBX0FjeVZiTHdaLTM1di1aR0ZNVmhaR3hrQnh3WWJHcVNQeVNWekhoXzRjaFNraW9KeEJEMlh1ZXJhendIWjdTRDdEMkNRZUw2V0VpbnBWaWJSMDV0RDQ2RFVfZXVISW1iTTdfRUtONW1tdll1dUZEQTVMX2NETlNIR0kyTzkwTFBpeEZzaG5uMm9Rdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="post col-12 col-md-11 clearfix"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today confirmed another travel-related case of dengue on Oahu, bringing the total number in the state to seven so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case comes just about a week after the &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/11/breaking-news/hawaii-sees-another-dengue-case-bringing-total-to-6-this-year/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;fifth and sixth cases&lt;/a&gt; of dengue were reported on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the affected individual was exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common, and that this case is not related to cases reported on April 10 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams were deployed to the affected area on Oahu, which the Health Department did not disclose, to implement mosquito control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there have been six cases on Oahu and one on Maui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes, which can be transmitted from an infected person to a mosquito to a person. While Hawaii is home to Aedes mosquitoes, which can carry dengue, the disease is not endemic, or established in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and rash, which typically last two to seven days, state health officials said. While severe illness can occur, most people recover within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone planning to travel to an area with dengue risk is vulnerable, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a year-round risk in the tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America; popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico; Asia; the Middle East; Africa; and several Pacific Islands, including American Samoa, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/images/global-dengue.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;listed countries&lt;/a&gt; reporting higher-than-usual numbers of cases or higher-than-expected cases among returning U.S. travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC advises travelers to areas with risk of dengue to prevent mosquito bites by using an EPA-registered insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors, and sleeping in an air-conditioned room or a room with window screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop within two weeks after a trip, residents should seek medical advice from a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’ve ever questioned whether a few too many drinks could affect your brain, a new study has some pretty concerning news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/brazil/index.html" id="mol-aa338b10-1bc4-11f0-9efb-3fa3af9d5272"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; have found that drinking just eight or more alcoholic beverages a week can significantly increase your risk of developing brain lesions- damage that could mess with your memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These brain lesions, linked to a condition called 'hyaline arteriolosclerosis,' are caused when the tiny blood vessels in the brain narrow and harden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduces blood flow, which, over time, can lead to brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds like something out of a sci-fi thriller, but unfortunately, the reality is less dramatic and more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, published in the journal Neurology, focused on nearly 1,800 individuals from the UK’s Biobank health database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were grouped based on their alcohol consumption habits - non-drinkers, moderate drinkers (people who have seven or fewer drinks per week), former heavy drinkers, and those who continued to drink heavily until the end of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And what the researchers found was startling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having eight or more alcoholic drinks a week can increase your chances of developing brain lesions, a new study has found (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study, moderate drinkers actually had a 60 percent higher chance of developing brain lesions compared to those who abstained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it gets worse for former heavy drinkers - those who used to drink a lot but quit had an 89 percent higher risk of brain lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worst-case scenario? Heavy drinkers who still hadn't stopped had a 133 percent greater risk of developing these lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the dangers don’t stop there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also showed that heavy drinkers, even if they eventually stopped, had higher odds of developing tau tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau tangles is a neurological marker associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This finding suggests that the long-term effects of heavy drinking can leave lasting damage, even if you’ve stopped drinking altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps most shocking, the study indicated that lifelong heavy drinkers tend to die, on average, 13 years earlier than those who abstain from alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Long-term heavy drinking can have negative effects on your life span even if you stop (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s a reminder that those nights of excessive drinking could have consequences aside from a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team, led by vascular expert Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo, made it clear that while they didn’t establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the association between heavy drinking and brain damage is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And though the data was based on the health records of UK residents, the findings are widely applicable to anyone who drinks regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While moderate drinkers didn’t fare as badly as heavy drinkers, the findings are still a wake-up call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if you’re not getting blackout drunk every weekend, regularly exceeding eight drinks a week could put your brain at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study serves as a reminder that moderation isn’t just for calories and carbs - it’s crucial for maintaining long-term brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, maybe it’s time to swap out that second (or third) glass of wine for something a little more brain-friendly. Your cognitive function may depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that a person’s everyday odor—captured on a worn T-shirt—predicted how much they were liked after short face-to-face conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “diplomatic” scents, shaped by daily habits and environments, aligned with impressions formed during four-minute speed-friending chats. The study suggests that scent, though often unnoticed consciously, plays a key role in guiding social connections beyond romantic attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odor Predicts Liking:&lt;/strong&gt; T-shirt scent alone predicted how women evaluated others after a four-minute chat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scent Is Personal:&lt;/strong&gt; Preferences for scent were highly individual, not universally “good” or “bad.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressions Shape Scent Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; Positive live interactions altered later odor judgments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two women meeting for the first time can judge within minutes whether they have the potential to be friends — guided as much by smell as any other sense, new Cornell University research on friendship formation finds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Interactive Role of Odor Associations in Friendship Preferences,” published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, adds to our understanding of the complex picture of what goes on when meeting someone for the first time — and judging the potential for future interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108863"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a couple of friends." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/olfaction-friendship-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While social olfactory research often focuses on mate selection, the researchers turned their attention to platonic interactions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of heterosexual women, the researchers found that personal, idiosyncratic preferences based on a person’s everyday scent, captured on a T-shirt, predicted how much women liked their interaction partners after four-minute “speed-friending” chats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These face-to-face conversations, in turn, influenced how participants later judged the T-shirt scents alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People take a lot in when they’re meeting face to face. But scent — which people are registering at some level, though probably not consciously — forecasts whether you end up liking this person,” said Vivian Zayas, professor of psychology and co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While social olfactory research often focuses on mate selection, the researchers turned their attention to platonic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And instead of focusing on individuals’ “&lt;em&gt;natural” &lt;/em&gt;odor — isolated from products, pets, and other environmental factors — the study leaned into the idea that people actively shape their signature scent through the many choices they make every day, what’s known as their “&lt;em&gt;diplomatic” odor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smell-only evaluations paralleled in-person evaluations: If a participant judged someone as having high friend potential based on the smell of a T-shirt, their evaluation of that same person after a four-minute interaction was similarly high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, evaluations from the live interaction predicted changes in a second round of diplomatic odor judgments, suggesting that the quality of the in-person interaction influenced how participants perceived the person’s smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayas said the consistency of judgments across the rating opportunities is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody showed they had a consistent signature of what they liked,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And the consistency was not that, in the group, one person smelled really bad and one person smelled really good. No, it was idiosyncratic. I might like person A over B over C based on scent, and this pattern predicts who I end up liking in the chat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this olfaction and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#96f3f3faa4d6f5f9e4f8f3fafab8f3f2e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ellen Leventry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ellen Leventry – Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-94350-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The interactive role of odor associations in friendship preferences&lt;/a&gt;” by Vivian Zayas et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interactive role of odor associations in friendship preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who we choose to befriend is highly personal, driven by idiosyncratic preferences about other individuals, including sensory cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does a person’s unique sensory evaluation of others’ body odor affect friendship formation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female participants took part in a speed-friending event where they made judgments of friendship potential (FP) following a 4-minute live interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to and following the speed-friending event, participants judged the FP of these women based solely on &lt;em&gt;diplomatic&lt;/em&gt; odor (including daily perfume/hygiene products) presented on worn &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also judged FP based on facial appearance (a 100-ms presentation of portrait photographs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judgments based solely on diplomatic odor predicted FP judgments following in-person interactions, beyond the predictive ability of photograph-based judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, judgments based on the live interaction predicted changes in the second round of diplomatic odor judgments, suggesting that the quality of the live interaction modified olfactory perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results were driven more strongly by idiosyncratic preferences than by global perceiver or target effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings highlight the dynamic role of ecologically relevant social olfactory cues in informing friendship judgments, as well as the involvement of odor-based associative learning during the early stages of friendship formation.&lt;/p&gt;

But Shuey said even the same amount of alcohol could affect women differently than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We need more education around the harms of alcohol use and how the same amount can pose greater health risks for women than men," Shuey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study only looked at two snapshots in time and didn't follow the same people over time, so they can't say whether these results are due to faster declines in drinking among young men or increasing rates among women, but Shuey pointed to several possibilities, including cultural changes around alcohol use, the likelihood of drinking among the young professional workforce and targeted alcohol marketing toward women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Still, the overall picture is clear: The gender gap in risky alcohol use is narrowing and in the case of young women is flipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The findings underscore the need for better screening and intervention strategies, said Shuey. He noted that brief counseling interventions during routine medical visits can reduce alcohol consumption by up to 30% in a six to 12-month period. But many patients are never asked about their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Screening should be a standardized process in all clinical encounters for risky alcohol use," Shuey said. He noted that asking about alcohol is already recommended in federal medical guidance, but not enough doctors ask the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Beyond screening, doctors can connect people to treatment, whether that's therapy, mutual support groups, or medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for next steps, Shuey said he hopes this research prompts not just clinical action, but public awareness. "There needs to be more education around the harms related to alcohol use, the normalization and the kind of heightened risk that alcohol has specifically to females relative to males," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Jay-Sheree Allen Akambase is a family medicine and preventive medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;If you or someone close to you needs help for a substance use disorder, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or visit FindTreatment.gov, SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:35:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPVmUwQm03LXI5dE9Lanp6WFVDdXR5U01ldFZoUTNQQmllZkNyUi1GX0Y4UzdBTmtocXB3VGRuTEZVYlFFTTJ0aHJiWm5oM3NoMl9CV2tVQnYyTzNIMkpYU09PV2lBZHhSY3FteHdiVVYwZ21ZUzdRZWhHWWZ1N0RRLWt6QmtxNnNKRzdLaF9mOVd2TGF2aXdZ</guid></item><item><title>加拿大和墨西哥的麻疹疫情带来严峻的预后-《纽约时报》 | Measles Outbreaks in Canada and Mexico Bring Grim Prognosis - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1ubUtFcV9HT09maGc0d216WnJRQno1RnBpNGE2a3VoUjFFUDJkUGYtNElwcWZhcVZId1lMM0JlYlM1akM3Mm1KY1VDd2o2dlZ4OXc0SkNVa0dUWHRZQ21rTGJYZ1hPXzltc1BEYWxiTUhmZnV6NlNHdDZBRlQwaWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the United States struggles to contain a resurgence of measles that has swept through swaths of the Southwest, neighboring countries are responding to their own outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Canada has reported &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;more than 730 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year, making this one of the worst measles outbreaks in the country since it declared the virus “eliminated” in 1998.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin K refers to a group of vitamins that deal with blood clots, bones, and your heart and blood vessels (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In adults, getting enough K1 from vegetables has been linked to better physical function and fewer injuries from falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin K2 on the other hand, plays a special role in bone and heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It helps move calcium into bones and out of arteries, where it doesn’t belong,' Pallian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that vitamin K2 activates two key proteins in the body: osteocalcin (for bones) and matrix Gla protein (for blood vessels). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;K2 has been shown to help slow bone loss and reduce the fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also being studied for preventing the hardening of the arteries and a variety of heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you're not sure if your getting enough vitamin K, your diet and immune system could be an indicator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you have a low-fat diet, poor dietary intake, malabsorption cases (think celiac disease), or long-term use of antibiotics, board-certified internist Dr. Michael Aziz said that you can develop a vitamin K deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;You can get your daily serving of vitamin K1 by eating leafy greens like cabbage and spinach (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Low levels can lead to heavy menstrual bleeding, delayed blood clotting, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and calcification of the arteries and tissues,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The good news is it’s easy to get enough vitamin K - especially if you eat plenty of vegetables,' Pallian said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To ensure you're getting enough vitamin K1, she recommended eating leafy greens like kale, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, and lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also suggested herbs like mint and parsley, and seaweed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For vitamin K2, Pallian advised eating fermented foods like natto (a Japanese fermented soybean dish), aged cheeses like Jarlsberg or Emmental, sauerkraut, egg yolks, liver (pork or beef), and meats like chicken and bacon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The exact amount we need isn’t clearly defined yet, but most people outside of places like Japan (where natto is common) don’t get much K2,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s why some people may benefit from supplements, especially older adults or those at risk of bone or heart problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity electrical pulses have been medically used to destroy tumors while sparing healthy tissue. But lower-intensity pulses may have a different effect—they reshape the battlefield, making tumors more vulnerable to the body's own defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;According to Virginia Tech researchers at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, these lower-intensity pulses don't kill all the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; outright. Instead, they alter the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt;'s environment, increasing blood vessel density within a day of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; and boosting lymphatic vessel growth by day three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes may help guide &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; to the tumor, potentially improving the body's natural ability to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in mouse models of breast cancer were &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10439-024-03674-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in a recent issue of the &lt;i&gt;Annals of Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;. Researchers looked at a lower-intensity version of a treatment called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-frequency/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-frequency&lt;/a&gt; irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) that destroys tumors using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+pulses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical pulses&lt;/a&gt;. It also helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells by changing the environment around the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a previous version of this technique was known to increase blood vessel growth and immune cell activity in the parts of the tumor that weren't completely destroyed, scientists didn't fully understand how these electric pulse treatments affect the lymphatic system, which plays a key role in immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new study, researchers used a mouse model of breast cancer to examine changes in blood and lymph vessels in and around the tumor, as well as in nearby lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists found blood and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lymphatic+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lymphatic vessels&lt;/a&gt; benefited from a lower-intensity version of H-FIRE, called sub-ablative H-FIRE. The tumor itself wasn't immediately destroyed, but the study suggests that these vascular changes might make the cancer more vulnerable to the body's natural defenses and potentially enhance the effects of additional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"These findings illustrate that after treatment, the tumor's blood and lymphatic vessels change in ways that could help the immune system respond more effectively," said Jennifer Munson, the corresponding author of the study and director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Cancer Research Center in Roanoke. "One key change is an increase in signals that may direct immune cells toward the tumor through the lymphatic system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research may focus on how the remodeling of these vessels affects immune activity and whether combining this treatment with other therapies could improve cancer treatment, said Munson, a professor with the research institute and the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics in the College of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

But she wasn't prepared for what would come next: a diagnosis of stage 4 brain &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-522e5000-196a-11f0-9775-517d25900f2f" class="class"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with scans showing a tumor the size of a small orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news was life-altering - and, within a week, she was rushed into surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It all just happened so fast,' Hulse told the Daily Mail. 'I went to seek medical help on the Monday, and I was in for surgery by Friday where I was told I might incur severe memory loss and need to learn how to talk again. I only developed symptoms over the course of the week.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, tumors in the lower part of the brain (the temporal lobe) can trigger memory problems, as it's where memories and senses are processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse's cancer story and the chain of events leading to her diagnosis echoes that of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills/index.html" id="mol-c118fd50-e984-11ef-aae7-916fe6822554" class="class"&gt;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; star's &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/teddi-mellencamp/index.html" id="mol-c0f807d0-e984-11ef-aae7-916fe6822554" class="class"&gt;Teddi Mellencamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Hulse, Mellencamp's brain cancer had progressed to an advanced stage before being detected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Jennifer Hulse started having trouble remembering the name of her boyfriend, she knew there was something drastically wrong. She later discovered she had stage 4 brain cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After getting the life-changing news, Hulse said it was all a blur and she was rushed in for surgery the same week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The TV star also said she suffered from 'debilitating' headaches for a short time before doctors discovered &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14390875/teddi-mellencamp-surgery-tumors-brain.html"&gt;several malignant masses in her brain&lt;/a&gt; that they believed had been growing for around six months. And, like Hulse, the 43-year-old TV star had no family history of cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Mellencamp's case, the tumors were the result of skin cancer spreading throughout her body. She continues to fight the disease following numerous surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hulse, on the other hand, was diagnosed with glioblastoma - one of the most aggressive and fast-growing forms of brain cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, more than 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma. The survival rate is bleak, with only around 5 percent living longer than five years after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite that devastating diagnosis, Hulse responded well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were able to stabilize her condition, though glioblastoma is known for recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse's is the same type of cancer that claimed the lives of Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy, as well as President Joe Biden's son, Beau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment typically begins with surgery to remove the tumor (a craniotomy), followed by intensive radiation and chemotherapy to get rid of anything that's left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average survival time after diagnosis is just 12 to 18 months, with those in advanced stages often falling toward the lower end of that range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After undergoing surgery in February 2017, Hulse began a grueling course of radiation and chemotherapy, which lasted for several months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Miracously, Hulse said the surgeons were able to remove her tumor in one go and she did not experience any memory loss upon waking up after the operation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was told that I might not be able to speak, but, if anything, my memory felt much sharper,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was born in Colombia and grew up in Germany, and I could still speak Spanish and German no problem after the surgery, which I was relieved about.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse was diagnosed with glioblastoma, which is a highly aggressive and fast-growing form of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse said: 'My boyfriend, Lloyd, was a real rock for me and I will be eternally grateful to all of the doctors.' Lloyd is now her husband&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some of the side effects Hulse suffers from include exhaustion and she has lost the hair on the left side of her head from the chemotherapy treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As she had only been dating her boyfriend, Lloyd, for four months before getting her cancer diagnosis, she says that she half expected him to leave - she even gave him the option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, he stuck by her side and sold his house so they could move into together.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among the lingering side effects of her treatment, Hulse has lost the hair on the left side of her head as a side effect of the chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, she has found that extensions do a great job at covering the area where her hair is thinner.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiation therapy also left her with a rare and painful complication: exposed bone in her ear canal, a condition known as osteoradionecrosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the American Head and Neck Society, roughly 4 to 8 percent of people with head and neck cancers develop this condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To manage it, Hulse was prescribed antibiotics and has to regularly monitor her ear to make sure an infection doesn't develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the negatives, Hulse says one of the positive 'superpowers' she now has is that she can 'fall asleep in just two seconds!' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the physical toll, she says the experience has changed her profoundly - and for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer has made me a better person and more appreciative of every moment in life,' she told the Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've come to understand that it's not luck, but the grace of God, that allows me to be here. I thought I was humble before all of this, but I realize now that I wasn't humble enough.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma every year and only around five per cent of those with this type of brain tumor survive longer than five years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse's brain cancer was in its advanced stages like the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star's Teddi Mellencamp (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some cancer patients report experiencing 'cancer ghosting' - when friends or loved ones withdraw or cut off contact after a diagnosis - Hulse said she was fortunate to be surrounded by unwavering support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was something that really helped get me through everything,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I had an amazing support system between my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My boyfriend, Lloyd, was a real rock for me, and I will be eternally grateful to all of the doctors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse and Lloyd married four years after her cancer battle, and she says they both share the same upbeat attitude about life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight years on, she still undergoes MRI scans every four months to monitor for any signs of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also chosen not to have children as the hormonal changes that come with pregnancy could spur on the disease's reemergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her message to others is simple but powerful: 'Watch the words you say, and say thank you every day. My cancer diagnosis has taught me that life can change in a second.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQdlhrOXVWaHBSZ2VRQVFIdTlWLVkzM0FhdWhTWUZTeGYzWjJ6VzUzT3E2V3ZNYVN2YXlzcDZWZGxobEhRYmNHZk9lVmFUSWppM1Z2dWZMVTZEd1Nyd2M1UlAxR0hxbDhSTmp6cHA3eHBlWkFNaUtNRE1zNmNBVVM1Z3BXeVJZRTFFaE0xUXVMLUZBM2M</guid></item><item><title>随着特朗普关闭其主要测试实验室，美国州披露令人眼花缭乱的杀手性病增加了1500 ％ -每日邮报 | US state reveals eye-watering 1,500% increase in killer STD... as Trump shutters its main testing lab - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZ2haN1hsaDJKcFk3UDd0X1phS0k3TkRYREF2NURUR0lMczZLOU43WEQwZHRyNHBITzI1NEFjOGxva29SZ1Q3Z3VrVy1IejVXb3JsWEpaSTFhU3hRbkRoOTgxd0N2YksteXlZeTAwQ28wSXJtOTJ1d0UxbVVnMkF5ajNiWHhINzJLbEtIbm5NNHhBemxJRUlXWEQyVUFMbjZyb3JDMTdZRlpiQdIBrwFBVV95cUxQRmpKOUV4QjlLaXk1MnJIZlVpUEVIT0E2ZmRIdkV3Vmtsd3JzTF9sMTJXYnh0cjQ3OTI1aklldlhNenJITUpJX0FIeFMxSTNYSFlCYVRKNUY2SnpJMV9jekwtSDd1SEpfYnZjZXFCa1JqVERJNXVzTF9oaGktMUpveXNHNzZRRlRqZklGQzBzZXcxNmVtQ3UxWVNxRFVWNnBrdGd6UkhpZGJZandEZUdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wisconsin/index.html" id="mol-928f7fb0-1baf-11f0-a13f-c7d996f3ea5a" class=""&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; has reported a 1,450 percent increase in congenital syphilis cases since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state announced the figures just over two weeks since the country's leading STD lab was shuttered as part of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622345/usa-government-food-scientist-quits-upfs.html"&gt;President Trump's cuts. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs when a baby is born with syphilis, which is an STI passed to a baby during pregnancy. It can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622209/trumps-CDC-launch-covid-vaccine-shakeup.html"&gt;cause severe health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including stillbirth, premature birth, and birth defects such as deafness and cataracts in the infant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, there were 31 cases of congenital syphilis in Wisconsin, compared to just two in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, rates of other STIs were shown to be high across the state, with 31,576 reports of infections such syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in 2024. Of these, over half were reported in people 15 to 24 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While we can celebrate that overall levels are decreasing, STIs continue to impact Wisconsin residents across the state, and the increase of congenital syphilis is especially concerning,' said state health officer Paula Tran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fortunately, STIs are preventable. This requires us all to ensure that people have access to accurate, age-appropriate education about sexual health alongside quality health services that support timely testing and treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes just as two national laboratories that did testing for rare forms of hepatitis and drug-resistant sexually transmitted diseases were forced to close following government cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wisconsin has reported a 1,450 percent increase in congenital syphilis cases just over two weeks since the country's government STD lab was shuttered as part of President Trump's cuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The STD prevention lab, which was active for almost four decades, was the national lead for testing and tracing outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea, such as one that occurred in a 2023 outbreak in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lab also conducted testing for new drug-resistant strains of STDs and developed national testing guidelines for diseases including chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, it was considered the world's leading viral hepatitis lab, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), and set lab testing standards for all US labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scott Becker, APHL's CEO, said that the lab was involved in testing samples from a current outbreak of viral hepatitis in Florida, and lab samples taken from patients were in transit when the lab was shuttered at the beginning of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The APHL sent a letter asking the US Department of Health and Human Services to restore the two national STD labs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association (ASTDA) echoed similar sentiments, stating that the 'abrupt and unexplained cuts in the absence of a clear plan to address the resulting gaps will have significant negative consequences for the American people'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organization added: 'The STD laboratory conducted essential work including the development of novel STI diagnostic tools and provision of technical support for state and local public health laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The elimination of the laboratory is an enormous loss that will impact STI public health practice and research for years to come.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The STD labs were part of the mass cuts at the CDC. With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Disease Intervention and Response Branch of the lab included more than 40 field assignees, ASTDA said 'who strengthened the capacity of local and state health departments to conduct STI/HIV disease intervention services'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The STD labs were part of the mass cuts at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before the job cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They included more than 1,700 scientists working at laboratories - the people who determine or confirm what germ or other threat is behind a rash of unexplained illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These two [STD] labs are effectively closed. The services they do are no longer available to our nation,' said Becker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HHS did not respond directly to a question about the decision to close the labs issued by Reuters but said broadly that HHS was restructuring and would keep critical programs in a new operation structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The official did not say whether the two public health labs were considered critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Airing their frustrations at the cuts, officials from ASTDA concluded: 'The loss of capacity for disease intervention and response services comes at a particularly dangerous time for our field, as the congenital syphilis epidemic continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'ASTDA strongly recommends continued support for and investment in STI prevention and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The essential services provided by the STI Laboratory Reference and Research Branch and the Disease Intervention and Response Branch at CDC should be bolstered, not eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The loss of these groups will have lasting consequences for our communities and patients and the services that we can provide.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advocacy group is urging US citizens to contact their legislators, and 'advocate for the restoration of essential STI services at CDC and ongoing federal investment in STI research and public health practice'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:54:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZ2haN1hsaDJKcFk3UDd0X1phS0k3TkRYREF2NURUR0lMczZLOU43WEQwZHRyNHBITzI1NEFjOGxva29SZ1Q3Z3VrVy1IejVXb3JsWEpaSTFhU3hRbkRoOTgxd0N2YksteXlZeTAwQ28wSXJtOTJ1d0UxbVVnMkF5ajNiWHhINzJLbEtIbm5NNHhBemxJRUlXWEQyVUFMbjZyb3JDMTdZRlpiQdIBrwFBVV95cUxQRmpKOUV4QjlLaXk1MnJIZlVpUEVIT0E2ZmRIdkV3Vmtsd3JzTF9sMTJXYnh0cjQ3OTI1aklldlhNenJITUpJX0FIeFMxSTNYSFlCYVRKNUY2SnpJMV9jekwtSDd1SEpfYnZjZXFCa1JqVERJNXVzTF9oaGktMUpveXNHNzZRRlRqZklGQzBzZXcxNmVtQ3UxWVNxRFVWNnBrdGd6UkhpZGJZandEZUdR</guid></item><item><title>帮助我在没有节食的情况下减掉20磅的欧洲“怪癖” —一次转变改变了一切-纽约邮报 | The European ‘quirks’ that helped me lose 20 lbs. without dieting — one shift changed everything - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPS1FObVZWNVFvSXdDcDdYMldWRlBTUUVBWk9GNnNaaVFlQnROVjVPSmNrQUVHRlRxZTVzTWF0ZS1uSVZxVndKdHRhSmJjVXpCR01xZmFVRFI5d1c1cWRKTUxxSTBPaks5N0w3TkpBeFNoTUNhckFOb1d2eDMzU1RDdktQXzRkV25PTmNPMGg0TV9Ya3pYSXdqT0ltWEhISi0w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;An American content creator who relocated to Portugal was surprised to discover several simple lifestyle “quirks” that helped her lose 20 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.coachviva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Richa Prasad&lt;/a&gt;, 39, moved from Seattle to Portugal two years ago, she found that her consumption habits clashed with local traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’d walk around with a drink in hand, sometimes even having my lunch on the go. I felt it was productive to knock out two tasks at the same time, but I noticed people kept giving me weird looks. Turns out nobody in Europe walks and eats,” she recently explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u02Hlm0BG_c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;video posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad noted that even on workdays in Europe, meals are seated affairs that last one to three hours — not because people are eating more, but because they’re pacing themselves through conversation. She learned that the same ethos applies to drinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Content creator Richa Prasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit from a less severe approach to wellness. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ekaterina Pokrovsky – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In Seattle, nights out meant slamming drinks. In Europe, people nurse their drinks for hours,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This slow, steady, savor mindset extends beyond eating and drinking and into workflow as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Whenever I meet new people in Europe, nobody ever asks me, ‘What do you do?’ In the US, that’s the first thing people want to know…In Europe, work is just one part of life, like going to a cafe. There’s no urgency, no drama,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit in mind, body and spirit from a less severe approach to wellness.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;“It’s shifting our mindset from dramatic high-stakes sprints to steady, consistent marches, meaning you commit to no longer pendulum swinging between being on a diet or completely off the rails,” she said. “Meal prepping with military precision or bingeing on takeout when life gets busy, then doing hardcore workouts as punishment for the binge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad said that Europeans tend to eschew diets for consistency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They just exist in a steady rhythm, and that’s the shift that changed everything for me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In accordance with that steady rhythm, she noticed that Europeans who lose weight do so without measures like restrictive dieting, extreme fasting or keto eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad maintained that most Europeans eat according to the principle of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Prasad moved from Seattle to Portugal two years ago, she found that her consumption habits clashed with local traditions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Europeans eat real butter, full-fat cheese and croissants without guilt. They don’t eat with a restrictive mentality where, even as you’re digging into that croissant, every bite is taken with guilt, because guess what happens when you eat with guilt: you don’t enjoy it, you’re never satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we should all abandon ourselves to rich eating and a daily dose of butter and bread?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes and no,” she confessed. “Because if you love food, you should eat real food that nourishes your body.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;Ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) make up about 60% of the US diet&lt;/a&gt; compared to just 14% of European diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs have been linked to a host of adverse health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/09/health/these-processed-foods-could-lead-to-early-death-study-says/"&gt;A 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;span class="embed-youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Video" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u02Hlm0BG_c?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad recommended we emulate our European counterparts and aim to reduce our junk food intake from 60% to 14%.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Most junk and sweets we eat tend to be out of cravings, not hunger,” she said. “So if we reduce the number of times we give in to cravings, the amount of junk we eat will all go down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/health/american-adults-eat-extra-meal-each-day-in-junk-food-study/"&gt;A 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found American adults average four meals a day — with one consisting entirely of junk food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to reducing or eliminating junk food, Prasad suggested cutting back on snacking, as most Europeans observe meal times and refrain from grazing in between.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By and large, they don’t snack. They tend to eat at set meal times and engage in mini-intermittent fasting, lasting three to four hours between meals,” she revealed. “This, in turn, reduces the chances of giving in to cravings because you’re no longer making a decision every time an urge to eat strikes you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad said these set meals should prioritize the inclusion of “one palm-sized portion of lean protein, one fistful of vegetables and one cup of water first. After that, you can eat whatever you want without guilt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Prasad suggests setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Davide Angelini – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;She encouraged setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/16/health/being-distracted-during-a-meal-can-lead-to-overeating-study/"&gt;2024 study &lt;/a&gt;found that&lt;/span&gt; people who ate while distracted reported less enjoyment and satisfaction, a greater desire for further gratification and increased snacking afterward. Researchers call this phenomenon “hedonic compensation” — making up for the loss of pleasure by seeking extra gratification elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to mindful eating practices, Prasad wants Americans to incorporate more physical activity into their daily lives, but to avoid intense, hunger-spiking exercise that’s more about punishment than pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of parking close to your building entrance, park far away and walk. Instead of taking the elevator, take the stairs,” she urged. “Drive to a park close to you and go for a walk as many times a week as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also suggests experimenting with different sports until you find one you really enjoy — and then optimizing your engagement for enjoyment, not improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unsung appendage in the female body, which has long been considered useless, may actually be essential for ovary development and fertility, a new mouse study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This structure, called the rete ovarii, was first discovered in humans over a century ago, but until now, it was considered a so-called vestigial structure — not crucial in adult female anatomy, but a leftover from fetal development. Vestigial anatomical structures, or "vestiges," are generally thought to have once had a crucial function that was later lost in the course of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to a new study, published March 19 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96662#content" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96662#content" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eLife&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the rete ovarii (RO) may actually play an important role in ovarian function, and therefore, fertility. The work also showed that the structure has three distinct regions and may respond to hormonal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The female reproductive tract is often thought to consist of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, oviduct, and ovaries," the researchers wrote in their paper. "We suggest that the RO be added to this list and investigated as an additional component of female reproductive function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although their study is based in mice, the researchers think it likely applies to people because the structure is also present in a number of other mammal species, including cows, cats, sheep, pigs, dogs and monkeys. Additionally, humans and mice share similar early sex-organ development pathways, so the scientists assume that the structure and its developmental cues might be similar&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/useless-human-body-parts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/useless-human-body-parts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 body parts that are useless in humans (or maybe not)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RO is a horseshoe-shaped network of tubes nestled beneath the ovary, at the site where blood vessels and nerves enter the organ. However, despite the structure being highly conserved among mammals, when it was first found in humans in 1870, scientists &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deemed it to have no use&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-L27uBnbJFSWL2Yf3HTbxrZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-L27uBnbJFSWL2Yf3HTbxrZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When this structure was first discovered in the late 1800s it was assumed that it had no purpose because scientists couldn't see its function within the body," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/adam-taylor(833b737c-bf8e-4ef8-9eff-2b2864e24d6b).html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/adam-taylor(833b737c-bf8e-4ef8-9eff-2b2864e24d6b).html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adam Taylor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of anatomy at Lancaster University who was not involved with the recent study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, "scientists also didn't have the same imaging, microscopic and molecular techniques available today," Taylor added. "These enable us to detect changes in blood flow, size changes of internal structures during life or ability to detect the proteins produced by the rete ovarii and compare these to similar ones produced elsewhere in the body where the function is known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in the new paper, researchers have applied modern methods to grant new insight into the RO. Some of their experiments used living mice, so that the researchers could study how the RO develops in the womb. Other tissues analyzed in the study were collected from euthanized animals after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the RO contains three distinct regions that mature during fetal development and then are maintained in adulthood. These regions include the intraovarian rete (IOR), located within the ovary itself; the extraovarian rete (EOR), made of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106648" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106648" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;convoluted tubules that join up into a bulb at one end&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and the connecting rete (CR), a transitional zone between the IOR and EOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mass spectrometry — a technique used to identify and quantify molecules — the researchers discovered that, at birth, the EOR contains thousands of proteins within its tubes that its own cells appear to produce. One protein was insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), may be involved in ovary function. The protein may modulate the availability and activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are structurally similar to insulin and important for the development of the follicles that carry immature eggs and hormones in the ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, the researchers watched fluorescent dye move through the EOR, revealing that fluid within the EOR is propelled toward the ovary. This further suggests that the RO has a role in ovarian function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another analysis, they found that the cells of the RO expressed, or switched on, genes that code for a variety of hormone receptors, including receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play important roles in female reproduction and health, helping to orchestrate the menstrual cycle, among other jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears that the rete ovarii may have a role in ovarian homeostasis - maintaining the ovaries and their environment," Taylor suggested. "Similarly they appear to be able to detect fluid movement in and around the ovaries and their microenvironment. Finally and most interestingly is the potential endocrine [hormonal] role that the rete ovarii may have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study suggest that the EOR may "act as an antenna" to receive signals from the rest of the body, both via hormones and nerves, and then send that information on to the ovary via the proteins it secretes and transports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dilara-Anbarci'" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dilara-Anbarci'" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dilara Anbarci&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to further investigate the function and component structures of the rete ovarii, looking into how the EOR actually responds to hormones and whether the proteins it secretes change in response to changes in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research challenges the traditional view of the RO being considered redundant, proposing instead that it has a secret wealth of functions. Figuring out how the rete ovarii works could one day help scientists better understand and treat conditions of the female reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The endocrine system plays a key role in gynaecological health," Taylor said. "A greater understanding of any structures in this region has the potential to open up new therapeutic avenues and opportunities in treating various conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases are the world's leading cause of death, and high blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than 1 billion people globally, with most living in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Many people diagnosed with hypertension are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors—better known as ACE-1 inhibitors (ACEIs)—and/or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/angiotensin+receptor+blockers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;angiotensin receptor blockers&lt;/a&gt; (ARBs), which act on the renin-angiotensin (RAS) pathway. But hypertension remains uncontrolled in most people with the disease, indicating that other affordable treatments are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in an article published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-025-02109-y" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hypertension Research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Penn's School of Dental Medicine and Perelman School of Medicine have investigated the benefits of adding oral ACE2—previously shown to have positive effects in injectable form for RAS-associated metabolic diseases—to these commonly prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This enzyme [ACE2] also regulates hypertension and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;," says co-author Henry Daniell, W.D. Miller Professor in Penn's School of Dental Medicine. Yet, he says, no one had looked at the relationship between these drugs and ACE2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAS pathway regulates blood pressure by triggering the release of renin when blood pressure falls. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which ACE then converts into angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACE inhibitors and ARBs lower blood pressure by acting on different steps of this process: ACE inhibitors inhibit the formation of angiotensin II, while ARBs block its ability to bind to its receptors. ACE2 lowers angiotensin II levels by converting it to angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7), which promotes vasodilation and reduces blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In this study, Daniell and colleagues built on their &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39861664/" target="_blank"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; using a lettuce-based plant-encapsulated system to evaluate oral delivery of ACE2 in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pet+dogs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pet dogs&lt;/a&gt; with myxomatous mitral valve disease. Importantly, these dogs also had elevated systolic blood pressure that was being treated with ACEIs and/or ARBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These were pet dogs," says Daniell, "So the owners, understandably, did not want to change their current medications. So, we had to continue their treatments with ACEI or ARB and then give them ACE2 in addition to see whether it was beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found surprised them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first surprise," says Daniell, "was that in the dogs on ACE inhibitors, those drugs inhibited the enzyme [ACE2] that we were giving them." And the second surprise? ARBs increased the angiotensin II pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniell says there are two things you don't want to do when trying to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lower+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. "You don't want to inhibit ACE2, and you don't want to increase the angiotensin II pool. And here we saw both." However, the good news, he says, is that not all ACEI drugs inhibited ACE2 activities equally—lisinopril, widely prescribed in the United States, inhibited ACE2 much less than other ACEI drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings have clinical relevance, says Daniell, as many human patients are prescribed one or both of these medications, and ACE2 has been shown to have cardioprotective effects that might have therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;ACE2 inhibition has also been linked to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. "I was stunned because this inhibition [with ACE inhibitors] was just like what &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/methods/fulltext/S2329-0501(22)00095-X" target="_blank"&gt;we observed with the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;," says Daniell. "Given what we saw during the pandemic, there is no question that ACE2 is a key metabolic enzyme."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps for Daniell and his colleagues are to repeat this study with dogs on lisinopril. Daniell explains, "We did this study to see how beneficial ACE2 is, but we couldn't do that because its activity was killed by all ACE inhibitors except for lisinopril."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Daniell would like to use his plant encapsulation system to evaluate the benefits of ACE2 treatment in humans, as an IND for this delivery system was recently approved by the FDA. He notes that currently there is no biologic drug to improve cardiopulmonary diseases. This IND approval makes "ACE2 the first engineered human blood protein expressed in plant cells approved by the FDA for evaluation in human clinical trials."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The average cost of launching a new injectable biologic drug [like ACE2] is $2.5 billion," says Daniell. "My entire career has been focused on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01899-1" target="_blank"&gt;making drugs affordable&lt;/a&gt;—especially for common diseases like diabetes and hypertension."&lt;/p&gt;

The recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are traditionally then honored and implemented by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most members on the vaccine panel were not opposed to altering the recommendations, they voiced concerns around the difficulties of implementing the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;President Donald Trump's newly formed CDC is tipped to launch a Covid vaccine shakeup that could crush big pharma profits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The vaccine committee met on Tuesday to discuss the issue as well as decide the vaccine schedules for other diseases for the 2025 season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Denise Jamieson, a dean at the University of Iowa's medical school and one of the panel members, said the US has a history of not being able to implement such variable recommendations and that COVID is still a leading cause of death among both adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I guess I am surprised we're considering a risk-based recommendation,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jamie Loehr, a family medicine doctor in New York and part of the panel, said he is happy the committee is considering a risk-based recommendation but also worried about feasibility and the message it would send.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Covid is still a fairly dangerous disease and very, very common,' he highlighted. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are not talking about 10 cases of mpox. We are talking about thousands of hospitalizations and deaths.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are currently around 500 Covid deaths per week across the US now compared to 25,000 at the peak in late 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A majority of the CDC's working group favored the risk-based approach compared to the current near universal recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panel is set to vote on formal recommendations in its June meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted on recommendations for use of three vaccines also discussed during the two-day meeting, shots for respiratory syncytial virus, chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease, and meningococcal vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are currently around 500 Covid deaths per week across the US now compared to 25,000 at the peak in late 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The CDC currently recommends that individuals aged six months and older should be given an updated Covid-19 vaccine, regardless of previous inoculations for the disease. A graph shows the current vaccination coverage among adults in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panel also discussed the ongoing US measles outbreak that has infected over 700 people this year, mostly among unvaccinated residents in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today's long-delayed ACIP meeting harks what we think are early indications of a more relaxed CDC under (Kennedy's) purview of the HHS,' Citi analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC director typically signs off on the panel's recommendations before they are implemented, but the agency does not currently have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;President Donald Trump nominated Susan Monarez to lead the CDC after withdrawing the nomination of former Republican congressman and vaccine critic Dave Weldon, but she has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An HHS spokesperson said CDC Chief of Staff Matthew Buzzelli would weigh in instead on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid low public enthusiasm about the Covid vaccines. Just 23.2 percent of adults over the age of 18 got their booster this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC currently recommends that individuals aged six months and older should be given an updated &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-cbd92ec0-1ba4-11f0-8e2e-834760a08e8d"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine, regardless of previous inoculations for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;America's recommendation makes it an outlier on Covid vaccines.

By December 2021, it had surged to over $61 as its Covid jab rolled out across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderna, a biotech newcomer at the time, closed 2020 at around $104, up more than 430 percent that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The following summer, its shares skyrocketed to $416, fuelled by record profits and unprecedented demand for its mRNA shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as the pandemic waned and vaccine demand plummeted, both companies saw their share prices tumble dramatically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer stock has more than halved from its peak, now sitting around $26 — a low not seen in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderna’s fall has been even steeper, with shares shedding almost 90 percent of its value, dropping to just $42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:19:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPcUgzdFpJYmZmT2NlSjZVWHI5aUxpUGNYYkxZS3JJT2ZNNVpHWFR2YmJpck03dnVJYkw1X1h3bUkyNHRWTEdQb25vY2JjX3pIaVgtWmctSFJYeXRQWU9UeG5MVG9EUWdGZGJ1aVFZRDJmczUwN1FhWVNoNzVJcDQtd1c5cVpZTkJ1b0JmRHQwcFRqZ0ptbk44RE8xUkfSAaIBQVVfeXFMTl9zVTZvakJ0RFRGOHNMdUNvZ1BuaUN1eW1fSTFVZmY0R1JWWUE0dklvSVo4SVhmSVdvWWloMUNYV3FNRENiUG1PR3pkTDNkWVUwVHJycThMWU5mYmpocWZhdG9XeklZYzZTTDJwWjVOSGwzclJUQm5ITjI0bU5qSkUzMFhHSkYyRlJ2eERoRlNTYnN2bFM3SF9oN1owcXV6UGVn</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心实验室裁员后，成千上万的尿液和组织样本有腐烂的危险- WIRED | Thousands of Urine and Tissue Samples Are in Danger of Rotting After Staff Cuts at a CDC Laboratory - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9lSjZLNU16Tl9MZ01oNFBiamkyWEVEWXVFTWt6dUxQREduZjZMVVE3N3FiZFB4bTdUOXJPZmFtVmItT0tIZzdiOVM4bUdtQzYxNWJHbmFrdlh1RXhpXzVWbXlYaUU5cTVVTVdvWWp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cathy Tinney-Zara, a worker at NIOSH’s Pittsburg facility who spoke to WIRED in her capacity as the union representative, says that before they lost their jobs, the researchers at the Morgantown facility had been actively studying how Gulf War soldiers were affected by exposure to Mustard Gas, how pregnant workers have been affected by exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/states-banning-pfas-forever-chemicals-industry-fighting-back/"&gt;PFAS chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and how manufacturing workers contract lung fibrosis after inhaling nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Two Morgantown researchers—who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous to avoid professional repercussions—say that their laid off colleagues were also researching how agricultural workers are impacted by inhaling dust from hemp plants, and a possible link between exposure to chemical disinfectants and asthma. The lab was also about to begin developing a rapid toxicity test for chemicals that US troops may be exposed to while they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Mandler says he was researching why some people who manufacture, cut, and install stone countertops were starting to get silicosis—a potentially fatal lung scarring and inflammation disease that makes it difficult to breathe—after just a few years on the job. Generally, he says, workers tend to get the disease after spending decades in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I have listened to men younger than me sit across the table and talk about how they feel like they're drowning in their own lungs because of these exposures, and they can’t see their children grow up,” Mandler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;He adds that some of the NIOSH staffers who lost their jobs were testing how lung tissue reacts after being exposed to the dust from different brands of commercial synthetic quartz. The material, commonly used in countertops, is thought to cause more severe lung damage than exposure to pure natural quartz, Mandler says. He believes something in the manufacturing process may be to blame, but now that his research team at NIOSH has been dismantled, Mandler fears it will take longer for the scientific community to find the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Three Morgantown researchers who were affected by the job cuts tell WIRED that they have not received any information about who would be in charge of the facility’s biological samples after the reduction in force, how custody of them could be transferred, or what their ultimate fate may be. Since entire divisions at NIOSH were eliminated, one researcher says, they don’t even know who could take responsibility for the samples they oversaw at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Another researcher says that when the layoffs happened, the only instruction they received was “to destroy our purchase and travel cards, and maintenance was available to help us take personal items to our cars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researcher says that CDC guidelines direct employees to keep physical samples and accompanying personally-identifiable information under lock and key, and only certain authorized staff are permitted to access them. “My colleagues and I took this responsibility very seriously,” the researcher tells WIRED. “Many are worried about samples and what will become of them, sensitive and otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Even before the recent reduction in force, Mandler and two other laid off researchers say that a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/federal-spending-freeze-could-have-widespread-impact-on-environment-emergency-management/"&gt;federal spending freeze&lt;/a&gt; ordered by the Trump administration in January had reduced the Morgantown facility’s supply of liquid nitrogen to “critical” levels. It took several weeks to restart the shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 15:48:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9lSjZLNU16Tl9MZ01oNFBiamkyWEVEWXVFTWt6dUxQREduZjZMVVE3N3FiZFB4bTdUOXJPZmFtVmItT0tIZzdiOVM4bUdtQzYxNWJHbmFrdlh1RXhpXzVWbXlYaUU5cTVVTVdvWWp3</guid></item><item><title>抗Vaxxers正在嘲笑麻疹爆发-并声称是由生物武器引起的- WIRED | Anti-Vaxxers Are Grifting Off the Measles Outbreak—and Claim a Bioweapon Caused It - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE84MEJuWWp5d1ctVkQzZkFDOVNMaHZJS0thYTFFRV8wSFQwN0VXZGFNVXotTmZqRk9YOVFNOVliTnk3WHBWT3g5bzY3VzQzWENhYnFsQVpZblVacF9IYlVHVGhaZ0M3dFdzZTVtNnQ3eUVXM3AxSVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;CHD has also pushed the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article-abstract/52/4/302/1621727?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;debunked claim&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin C offers protections against contracting measles. The group’s website is currently promoting an ebook titled &lt;em&gt;The Measles Book: Thirty-Five Secrets the Government and the Media Aren’t Telling You about Measles and the Measles Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;. The foreword of the book is written by Kennedy, who is now the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;CHD, Kennedy, and the HHS did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On X, anti-vaccine influencers claimed without evidence that hospital employees had mistreated the first patient, leading to their death. One of those pushing this narrative was Syed Haider, a doctor who was part of the notorious Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which formed during the pandemic and pushes dubious and ineffective treatments. Haider has almost 170,000 followers. Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon with 50,000 X followers, also pushed this claim. Ealy’s 2022 report &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/"&gt;falsely claiming&lt;/a&gt; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had altered records to boost deaths linked to Covid-19 has been cited in the past by CHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Marissa Brooke Alesi, an influencer known as Red Pill Patriot, posted a video on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook claiming the child was hospitalized for pneumonia and RSV. “They then proceeded to give that child the MMR vaccination,” Alesi says, suggesting that the use of the MMR vaccine contributed to the child’s death. The video has been viewed over 3 million times on Instagram alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Haider, Ealy, and Alesi did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Pierre Kory, a doctor best known for his role as the founder of FLCC and a central figure promoting ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19, has also been pushing the narrative that measles was not the cause of the deaths of two children in Texas. In recent weeks, he has claimed without evidence that the measles crisis was, in fact, a targeted attack on the Mennonite community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In August of last year, the American Board of Internal Medicine &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/"}' href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revoked Kory’s certifications&lt;/a&gt;; just a month earlier, Kennedy &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1810444249701187706" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1810444249701187706"}' href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1810444249701187706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; Kory as a “brave dissident doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Do you want to know the real story on this case?” &lt;a data-offer-url="https://alexmorozovny.substack.com/p/real-story-of-the-measles-case-vibrating" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://alexmorozovny.substack.com/p/real-story-of-the-measles-case-vibrating"}' href="https://alexmorozovny.substack.com/p/real-story-of-the-measles-case-vibrating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kory told a physician and activist last month.&lt;/a&gt; “Several of us believe that they weaponized this measles virus—on purpose.

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that a pair of popular glucose-lowering medications may have protective effects against the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in patients with Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0353"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers studied Medicare claims data of older adults with Type 2 diabetes to assess the association among &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/diabetes-1-insulin-semaglutide-2971392/"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt;, or GLP-1RAs, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT2is, and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data showed a statistically significant association between a lower risk of Alzheimer’s and the use of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is compared with other glucose-lowering medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, the findings indicated that the two drugs may have neuroprotective effects for people without diabetes and may help slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serena Jingchuan Guo, an assistant professor of pharmaceutical outcomes and policy at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy and the study’s senior author, says these findings may point to new therapeutic uses for drugs commonly used to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting that these diabetes medications may offer additional benefits, such as protecting brain health,” Guo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on our research, there is promising potential for GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is to be considered for Alzheimer’s disease prevention in the future. As use of these drugs &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/weight-loss-drugs-glp-1-receptor-agonists-california-2990572-2/"&gt;continues to expand&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes increasingly important to understand their real-world benefits and risks across populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the study only included patients with Type 2 diabetes, Guo says next steps include evaluating the effects of the two drugs in broader populations by using recent, real-world data that captures their growing use in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future research should focus on identifying heterogeneous treatment effects—specifically, determining which patients are most likely to benefit and who may be at greater risk for safety concerns,” Guo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for the research came from the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, both part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

Bradyarrhythmias &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23349-bradyarrhythmia" target="_blank"&gt;are abnormally slow&lt;/a&gt; heart rates of typically below 60 beats per minute, compared with the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21854-ventricular-arrhythmia#:~:text=What%20can%20cause%20a%20ventricular,Medications." target="_blank"&gt;Ventricular arrhythmias occur&lt;/a&gt; when the lower chambers of the heart, or ventricles, beat too fast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone,” said senior study author Dr. Jill Pell, the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. “You don’t need to spend money going to a gym or buying equipment. You can just walk out of your front door and keep going.”&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000b3b6oa6fj9kec@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 60 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation, according &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00205-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;to a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;. Estimates of people with other arrhythmias are less conclusive, but in general, people with arrhythmias are at higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes and dying early, Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000c3b6owugpdl5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are medicines and procedures that can be offered to these people but it would be preferable to prevent heart rhythm abnormalities from occurring in the first place,” Pell added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000d3b6olxy30agl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been only one previous study on walking pace and heart rhythm abnormalities, and it focused on just one type of arrhythmia, Pell said. And past research has indicated that “walking pace is linked to other outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, so we wanted to see if the same was true of heart rhythm abnormalities,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000e3b6oyoy8apaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors studied health and activity data from adults who had been recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/about-us#:~:text=Since%202006%2C%20UK%20Biobank%20has,a%20large%2Dscale%20prospective%20study." target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank study&lt;/a&gt;, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom. Participants answered questionnaires that asked whether their walking pace was slow (less than 3 miles or 4.8 kilometers per hour), average (3 to 4 miles or 4.8 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) or brisk (more than 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers per hour).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000f3b6oi3ptkwha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a follow-up period of 13 years on average, 9% of participants developed arrhythmias.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000g3b6oze2lxyxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had data on self-reported walking pace from more than 420,000 people but we also had accelerometry data on (nearly) 82,000 of these,” Pell said, referring to data from watches that track movement speed. “The data from the watches showed that walking at an average pace (3-4 miles per hour) for only 5-15 minutes per day was sufficient to reduce your risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000h3b6obuc5o609@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The associations were strongest among people under 60, people without obesity, those with high blood pressure or two or more preexisting conditions, and women, the authors found. &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000i3b6opm18lpgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an interesting finding because, although women are less likely to get atrial fibrillation than men, when they do get it they are at a higher risk of going on to get heart attacks and strokes than men with atrial fibrillation,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000j3b6ogv0ogmya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cardiologist Dr. Martha Gulati found the study important and said it confirms earlier related research — by herself and others — that showed benefits of physical activity for atrial fibrillation and stronger associations among women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000k3b6o83zchkw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This shows that one of the primary prevention strategies to reduce cardiac arrhythmias is brisk walking,” added Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Gulati wasn’t involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9k6nfvk000t3b6o1aef1w7h@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-relationship-between-walking-and-heart-speeds" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Since the study is observational, it doesn’t prove a cause and effect, the authors said. Self-reported health data is also vulnerable to inaccurate recollections or biases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000m3b6own7otbck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In observational studies, there’s always a risk that people who walk slower do so because they already have disease, Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000n3b6o3qwxd9t9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We did everything possible to avoid this by making sure that no one had any type of heart or vascular disease at the beginning of the study,” she added. “However, we really need an intervention study now to confirm our findings: a study of people who walk slowly in which some are asked to increase their walking pace and some are not,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000o3b6ozao0b8z4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A-Fib is associated with multiple risk factors that are also linked with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, said Dr. Sean Heffron, director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000p3b6oe34x8uzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants who walked faster were more likely to be men, live in less deprived areas, have healthier lifestyles and weigh less. They also had better grip strength, smaller waists and lower levels of inflammation and metabolic risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000q3b6ok89f1ay0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And bradyarrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias are nonspecific and can have lots of other causes and certainly are far less clearly associated with lifestyle-type factors than is atrial fibrillation,” Heffron added. “I feel like lumping them all together was interesting.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000r3b6omfvwwhb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors found that over one-third of the beneficial effect of a faster pace “was due to the fact that walking faster reduces cholesterol, glucose and blood pressure and makes you less likely to put on weight,” Pell said, noting that those reductions lower your risk of heart rate abnormalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000s3b6ouksffdfo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though a brisk pace seems to be better than a slow pace, “the first step is literally a step,” Gulati said. “Walking slow is how we start, but the more you do it, the faster your pace will become.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The revised strategy focuses on controlling outbreaks, while expanding vaccination coverage and transitioning toward a longer-term, sustainable response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="72167074" paraeid="{a81afdd1-eb40-46ef-9b89-b72e653ce17d}{73}"&gt;Mpox is a viral illness that spreads between people, mainly through close contact. It causes painful skin and mucosal lesions, often accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be debilitating and disfiguring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="502691387" paraeid="{a81afdd1-eb40-46ef-9b89-b72e653ce17d}{91}"&gt;Historically a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected animals, mpox has increasingly shown a tendency to spread between people. In 2022, a variant of the virus, clade IIb, began spreading globally through sexual contact. Since late 2023, yet another viral strain, clade Ib, began spreading through sexual networks and within households and through close contact. This prompted Africa CDC to declare a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security and the WHO Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1120094972" paraeid="{a81afdd1-eb40-46ef-9b89-b72e653ce17d}{175}"&gt;By August 2024, the virus had begun spreading from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 4 neighbouring countries. Since then, 28 countries around the world have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib. Outside Africa, cases remain largely travel-related. However, within Africa, in addition to transmission in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, local transmission has now been documented in additional countries including the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="306758975" paraeid="{49ce37c9-468e-44ac-975a-f640c3aed20e}{22}"&gt;Since the declaration of the emergency, both regional and global support has increased, particularly for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. The Africa CDC and WHO Joint Continental Mpox Plan has guided these efforts, focusing on ten key pillars: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, clinical management, infection prevention and control, vaccination, research, logistics, and maintaining essential health services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="144589416" paraeid="{732df743-cf09-447c-9e89-c4d83caaaffc}{50}"&gt;Vaccination efforts are underway, with more than 650 000 doses administered in 6 countries, 90% of which have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overall, over a million doses have been delivered to 10 countries, with efforts ongoing to secure additional vaccine supplies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="401794116" paraeid="{732df743-cf09-447c-9e89-c4d83caaaffc}{76}"&gt;Diagnostic testing capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown significantly, driven by the expansion of laboratory infrastructure - from 2 laboratories in late 2023 to 23 laboratories in 12 provinces today. With new, near-point-of-care tests currently being rolled out in the country, capacity is expected to increase even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="16991028" paraeid="{732df743-cf09-447c-9e89-c4d83caaaffc}{132}"&gt;Despite this progress, major challenges remain. Ongoing conflict and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the incidence of mpox remains high, as well as humanitarian aid cuts, continue to limit the public health response and restrict access to essential services. Across countries and partners, over US$ 220 million is needed to fill funding gaps for the mpox response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2020588481" paraeid="{732df743-cf09-447c-9e89-c4d83caaaffc}{152}"&gt;The updated Continental Response Plan calls for intensified efforts to bring outbreaks under control, while also taking concrete actions to integrate mpox into routine health services.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1932654900" paraeid="{fe948e47-5947-4fe1-a653-44b1103cea55}{31}"&gt;Along with the Continental Response Plan for Africa, WHO has updated the global strategic plan to curb - and where feasible, to stop - human-to-human transmission of mpox. In the first two months of 2025, 60 countries reported mpox, with the majority of cases and deaths reported from the African continent.  The joint Continental Response Plan is aligned with the global strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1176912595" paraeid="{732df743-cf09-447c-9e89-c4d83caaaffc}{158}"&gt;Africa CDC and WHO continue to work closely with national governments, local communities, and partners to curb transmission, control the outbreak, and build longer-term resilience within public health systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Measles causes a respiratory illness with high fevers, tiredness, painful runny nose, cough and red eyes, followed by a characteristic rash. If not immune, 90% of people exposed to measles will get sick from the virus. Measles can be especially severe in young infants and those with a compromised immune system. A measles infection can lead to bacterial pneumonia, low oxygen levels that require hospital care and brain inflammation. Measles can be deadly in infants and for kids, one to three out of 1,000 will die if unvaccinated. Years after a measles infection, a fatal neurologic disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) can develop, and there is no cure. Measles during pregnancy can result in stillbirth. Additionally, pregnant people also can become severely ill or die from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Why do measles outbreaks occur?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus. It can linger in the air for hours after an infected person has been in a given space. One person can infect up to 18 unvaccinated persons who have been in the same location. Because this virus is so contagious, having strong population-based immunity to measles is critical to preventing outbreaks. The most recent large outbreak of measles is due to vaccination rates dropping below 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Is measles preventable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: In the U.S., the measles vaccine is included in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or MMR plus varicella (MMR-V) vaccine. Healthy children and adults who have received two doses of the vaccine, spaced by at least four weeks between doses, need not worry about contracting measles or passing this virus on to others. Children who have received at least one dose and are not yet due for their second dose are also protected. People who received one dose of the vaccine and are overdue for the second dose may be at increased risk. A second dose is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Vitamin A does not prevent measles, only the MMR vaccine can prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What are the best ways to protect myself from measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Vaccination is the most effective and complete way to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community from measles. Very young infants and those who are immunocompromised may be eligible for a measles antibody (immune globulin) injection, but the antibody is not widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe for all children and adults?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The MMR vaccine is safe and effective for healthy individuals 6 months of age or older. The vaccine is not safe for those with certain types of immune deficiency, including advanced HIV/AIDS and anyone who has had an organ transplant or is undergoing chemotherapy. Just like any vaccine, the MMR vaccine can cause temporary side effects (fever, localized pain/redness), and, rarely, can cause a measles-like rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Given the measles spread, should children be vaccinated earlier than scheduled?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The only time children will need an accelerated schedule is if they will become immunosuppressed (undergoing chemotherapy, starting immunosuppressant medications, expecting a bone marrow or organ transplant or anticipated use of high-dose steroids for conditions such as asthma), or if they’ll be traveling overseas for an extended period. Contact your pediatrician for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Can you still get measles despite being fully vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The MMR vaccine has an efficacy rate of 97%. If you are fully vaccinated, you are very unlikely to contract measles. If you do, you are very unlikely to become seriously ill from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: If I had two doses of MMR vaccine, do I need a booster?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Most people who received both doses will not need a booster. If you are unsure if you have received the MMR vaccine, your primary care provider can order a blood test to confirm protective immunity. People who received the MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1967 likely received an inactivated measles vaccine. They should receive at least one additional dose of the current vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: If an adult had measles as a child, is a booster needed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Anyone with a prior measles infection does not need to receive the MMR vaccine. A measles infection induces lifelong immunity (just like the vaccine). Because measles was so prevalent before the MMR vaccine was released, most people born before 1957 were infected during childhood, and therefore, are now considered immune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What if someone under 6 months of age comes in contact with measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: If the community has at least 95% immunity to measles, it is very unlikely that the youngest infants will be exposed to the virus because there is excellent “herd immunity.” Infants with an increased risk of exposure, such as those who live in or travel to an area with a known outbreak, can receive an antibody (immune globulin) injection to provide four to six months of immunity. This injection, available at some health departments, is not a substitute for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: How should I handle a measles exposure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: How you should respond to a measles exposure depends on the vaccine and health status of the exposed person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 kDvXdO font_openSans articleList"&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received two doses of MMR do not need to take any further measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received one dose of MMR and are due or overdue for a second dose should receive the second dose as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received no doses of MMR should be vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who are too young to receive the MMR vaccine, pregnant people or those who have a severely compromised immune system (with or without prior complete vaccination) should contact their primary care provider or local health departments as soon as possible to determine if treatment with measles immune globulin would be beneficial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;If you are concerned that you may have measles or have been exposed, please call ahead of time before seeking treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What is the current status of measles outbreaks in the U.S.?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Measles had been previously eliminated in the U.S.; however, there have been outbreaks over the past decade.

In a chocolate tasting study, participants from higher socio-economic backgrounds showed stronger alignment between their internal hunger signals and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds did not show the same physiological regulation, despite similar levels of consumption. This study suggests that bodily signals for hunger and satiety may function differently depending on socio-economic conditions, providing insight into health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagal Tone Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher vagal activity predicted eating behavior only in participants from wealthier backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaker Regulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal signals of hunger and fullness were less predictive in participants from lower socio-economic groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; These differences may contribute to dietary inequalities and long-term health disparities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Durham University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Food Quality and Preference&lt;/em&gt;, the research highlights how physiological signals, particularly those transmitted via the vagus nerve, interact with socio-economic factors to shape dietary behaviour. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 96 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds who participated in a chocolate tasting session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108855"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people eating." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled laboratory setting, each participant was presented with a plate containing 70 milk chocolate pieces and invited to sample and rate them at their leisure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured each student’s heart rate variability (HRV) as a proxy for the activity of the vagus nerve – a part of the nervous system that regulates appetite and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, Professor Mario Weick of Durham University’s Department of Psychology, explained: “The findings suggest that while the vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting signals between the gut and the brain, the extent to which these signals guide eating behaviour can vary with one’s socio-economic status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that internal signals may be more closely aligned with eating behaviour in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, those from lower socio-economic groups appear to show a weaker link between these physiological signals and their food consumption.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on longstanding theories regarding the impact of socio-economic factors on health and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, disparities in diet have been attributed to differences in food access and external factors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this study shifts the focus towards internal regulatory processes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that participants from more advantaged backgrounds consumed more or less chocolate depending on their vagal tone, which can signal both hunger and satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in individuals from less advantaged backgrounds, this physiological regulation was not as evident.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Milica Vasiljevic of Durham University, the study’s co-author added: “Our study does not support the idea that individuals from lower socio-economic groups eat more or are inherently more impulsive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, it highlights that the internal regulation of eating – how our bodies naturally signal when to eat and when to stop – may function differently depending on our socio-economic backgrounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could have important implications for understanding broader health inequalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is needed to explore whether similar patterns are observed across different populations and with other food categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work marks a significant step forward in disentangling the complex relationship between socio-economic status, physiological regulation, and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing attention to the role of internal bodily signals in shaping eating behaviour, the research offers new perspectives for developing public health strategies that address dietary inequalities and associated long-term health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neuroscience

consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic status (SES) correlates with patterns of food consumption, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines how SES modulates the relationship between vagal tone, a physiological marker of self-regulation, and chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different hypotheses about how SES may be linked to vagal regulation of chocolate consumption were put to a test in a laboratory study with a socio-economically diverse group of students (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vagal tone was assessed using an index of heart rate variability (HRV–HF) measured at rest (baseline) and during acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ chocolate consumption was measured using a bogus taste test. The results showed that socio-economic status interacted with vagal tone to influence chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings for both subjective and objective indicators of SES converged in showing that vagal tone predicted chocolate consumption among higher SES participants, with higher vagal tone associated with lower chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such relationship was found in lower SES participants, suggesting a dissociation between vagal regulation and eating behaviour in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of considering autonomic regulation in understanding socio-economic disparities in dietary behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5tSzJURDNna2hYaXVUYUhIbWFSQVQ5N2hEZDRuaHoxNTZJRVNTZ01mTDR6WXFITnRYWnJ4TktwdzVncnhkNnBibE5oZlZKUk9DY1lLWlBkVThUXzUzM3lwOXppYUg5a0RDRVc0MGNteUJ1bHB5</guid></item><item><title>推动这三只股票的血液测试革命-投资者商业日报 | The Blood Test Revolution Driving These Three Stocks - Investor's Business Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQNV85TU1MbHhTX0xsQTFsUVJlQTUtVjJGQ3JET3YwcEpDYjY0NG01enJWSE52T1JtZDZ6UkdJZWtCWmNrUFEyRTE4R2FsZUd6ckJVbmtvZkcwTnRlRUl0NktEOHQ3aklCUFFrM2ZHVDFxSWozbVM1SjdBbTRmYXpKbXd3TUNzSTRuYWE4Q1pZN3g5ZEJKM3lGUW40RHVCUktETW5jNlIwZGptY29QVGdMWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer rates are on the rise, particularly in young people. And when it comes to cancer, it's a no brainer that the earlier a patient undergoes treatment the better the chance they have of surviving. Guardant, Natera and Exact are blazing trails in the use of blood tests to detect cancer relapses months sooner than traditional technology. They do this by looking for tumor DNA in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a low level of tumor DNA in the blood is dangerous, says Richard Chen, chief medical officer for &lt;strong&gt;Personalis&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSNL" target="_blank"&gt;PSNL&lt;/a&gt;), a small biotech company that sells a minimal residual disease, or MRD, test called NeXT Personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It means that the cancer is there, it's festering and there's a good chance it's going to expand and recur for the patient," he told Investor's Business Daily. "Yes, I think it is a five-alarm fire in the sense that if you don't do anything about it and leave it alone, (immune system) surveillance is not necessarily going to take care of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/27/3002196/28124/en/Minimal-Residual-Disease-Testing-Market-Growth-Trends-2025-2031-Growing-Use-of-MRD-Testing-In-Cases-of-Solid-Tumors.html#:~:text=The%20minimal%20residual%20disease%20testing,crucial%20for%20cancer%2Daffected%20patients." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;massive and growing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/mrd-testing-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MRD test market&lt;/a&gt; could be worth between $4.45 billion and $6.7 billion in the early 2030s, according to market estimates. That's up from $2.2 billion in 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/minimal-residual-disease-testing-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt;. What's driving the opportunity? A sharp increase in the number of cancer diagnoses and, in turn, survivors. By 2040, the National Cancer Institute expects there will be 26 million &lt;a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cancer survivors in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Massive Market For Guardant Health, Rivals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer emerges from cellular mutations. MRD tests seek to find those mutations as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a patient is diagnosed with cancer, the most common route is to attack it with surgery. Guardant Health, Exact Sciences and Natera can run that sample through their systems and come up with a set of mutations — or biomarkers — consistent with that cancer, but not the patient's own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant sells Reveal, while Natera has its Signatera test. Exact is angling to launch its rival, Oncodetect, in the second quarter. These blood tests screen for a small handful of cancers today. But the companies are vying to prove their merit in a growing number of cancers. Notably, fellow biotech company &lt;strong&gt;Veracyte&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VCYT" target="_blank"&gt;VCYT&lt;/a&gt;) is planning to launch an MRD test for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-medicare-reveal-coverage-blood-test/?_gl=1*15xsk4r*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0NzQuMzAuMC4w"&gt;monitor for cancer recurrence&lt;/a&gt; through a variety of imaging tests. If a patient had breast cancer, they might undergo routine mammograms. Lung cancer patients will often receive semi-regular CT scans to look for new tumors. Other patients might undergo PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're in remission from your cancer, obviously the No. 1 concern that you have is your cancer is going to come back," Mike Brophy, chief financial officer of Natera, told IBD. "There's already a whole architecture of care for you to monitor that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cancer can be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The majority of breast cancer survivors who've had their cancer return, it's not going to return to the breast," Brophy said. "It's probably going to return to the liver or the lungs. And you're not going to catch that if you're doing radiology — an image of the breast."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Months Of Lead Time For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the cancer type, blood tests can detect a relapse an average of 15 months before imagining scans, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-guardant-health-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt; Chief Executive Helmy Eltoukhy told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant's Reveal detects minimal residual disease associated with early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancers. This group accounts for 40% of all cancer survivors, Eltoukhy estimates. Medicare pays for the cost of colon cancer monitoring. Guardant is working to receive reimbursement for breast and lung cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data released in late 2023, Guardant Reveal has detected a breast cancer relapse up to 28.6 months before it would show up with imaging, but with a median lead time of 7.9 months. The latter time also detected a relapse with high specificity, meaning it's more likely to rule out patients who don't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera's Brophy says Signatera can detect recurrent cancer around nine months before standard scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT from Personalis has a six- to 11-month lead time in early-stage lung cancer and can detect breast cancer relapse a median of 15 months ahead of traditional imaging. Chen, the company's CMO, describes NeXT as an ultrasensitive test. That means it's 10 to 100 times more sensitive, analytically, than the first generation of blood tests from companies like Guardant Health and Natera, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study called Alpha-Correct, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Exact Sciences&lt;/a&gt; followed colorectal cancer patients for five years. Oncodetect was able to detect cancer recurrence about 10.4 months earlier than imaging, Chief Science Officer Jorge Garces told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is critical," he said. "Weeks and months are critical in terms of being able to manage the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Escalating Or De-Escalating?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But relapse monitoring isn't the only use for MRD testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blood tests can also determine the success of a surgery and how to proceed from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a patient is recovering from surgery at home, companies like Guardant Health and Natera build their bespoke test. Then, after a month or so, patients get a blood draw. That blood carries the answer to the most common question for cancer patients following surgery: Did they get it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take colorectal cancer. Roughly two-thirds of patients undergo surgery and that's it. They're cured. The remaining third have micro metastases — meaning the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. But the tumors aren't visible yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Postsurgery, both the two-thirds of people who are cured by surgery and the one-third that need to follow up with chemo, they present the same way," &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/stock-market-ibd-50-stocks-3/?_gl=1*h8k09b*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NzIuOS4wLjA."&gt;Natera&lt;/a&gt;'s Brophy said. "It's hard to tell who is who, even though doctors and patients know full well a ton of people are going to get the chemo and don't need it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a better-safe-than-sorry mentality. But these blood tests could change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera has published data comparing patients who received chemotherapy after having their tumor surgically removed. Those who tested positive for circulating tumor DNA had a statistically significant benefit from chemo. Those who tested negative experienced no benefits from chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is expensive and often causes painful side effects, Brophy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, you have this ability to triage these patients after surgery to see who really needs chemotherapy and who doesn't," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MRD Testing Takes On Pseudo-Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third use case is in monitoring patients who are actively receiving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients don't automatically undergo surgery. In breast cancer, for example, somewhere around half of patients first receive progressive rounds of chemotherapy in the hopes of shrinking the tumor. This will eventually allow them to receive a lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy — removing a lump is generally preferable to removing the entire breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to imaging, cancer often responds to aggressive treatment by appearing bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon is called pseudo-progression. The tumor isn't getting bigger because the cancer is worsening, says Personalis' Chen. It's enlarging because immune cells are going into the tumor to fight it. This is often the case when patients receive immuno-oncology drugs that help uncover camouflaged cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The blood-based tests don't have that issue," Susan Tousi, chief executive of DELFI Diagnostics, said in an interview. DELFI makes blood tests that screen people for cancer, a space closely tied to MRD testing. "I think there are some benefits that allow for earlier detection and more robust detection of treatment response."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges Ahead For Guardant, Natera, Exact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/biotech-stocks-rhythm-pharmaceuticals-rytm-ibd-50/?_gl=1*9cw1r1*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NjMuMTguMC4w"&gt;challenges facing Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt;, Exact Sciences and Natera, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it already hasn't been easy for the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant stock had an impressive run from October to January, surging almost 105%. Since then, shares have pulled back somewhat. They're still nowhere near their record high above 181 in early 2021. But Guardant stock has climbed more than 32% this year, as of the close on Wednesday, outperforming Investor's Business Daily's Medical-Services industry group, which has risen a more moderate 2.6%. The group ranks ninth out of 197 groups IBD tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health shares rank No. 21 on the &lt;a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/"&gt;IBD 50&lt;/a&gt; list of elite growth stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera belongs to the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group. Veracyte ranks first, leading Natera as the second top seed. Natera shares mostly fell from late 2021 to early 2022. But shares more than quadrupled through January of this year. On a year-to-date basis, Natera shares have fallen more than 5%. The industry group, which ranks a poor No. 167, has tumbled a more precipitous 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exact Sciences stock has mostly fallen over the last few years, peaking in January 2021 above 159. Today, shares of the MRD testing company trade around 42. Exact shares dropped dramatically last November after the company missed third-quarter sales expectations and enacted an "alarming" &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1jph11e*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjQzNjYyMDQxOS4xNzQwNjc3MTgxLjE3NDA2NzcxODE.*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MTE5MzUyMS45NS4xLjE3NDExOTYzNzEuNDcuMC4w"&gt;guidance cut&lt;/a&gt;. This January, shares took a hit on competitive concerns facing its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-cologuard-guardant-health-natera/"&gt;stool-based colorectal cancer test&lt;/a&gt;, Cologuard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that all three companies work in tangential testing markets. Guardant is well known for its Shield test, which uses blood to screen for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic people. Exact sells Cologuard and a multicancer early detect test called CancerGuard. Natera has numerous tests for cancer, women's health and organ health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, none of these companies are profitable — which isn't exactly a rarity for companies in the biopharma space. But it's also not preferable for savvy investors. According to FactSet, analysts don't expect Exact Sciences to notch its first profits until 2026. Natera is expected to follow in 2027. But analysts don't expect earnings, on a strict, as-reported basis, for Guardant until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting New Cancer Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health estimates 12 million cancer survivors are more than five years out from their surgery. About 3 million of them don't have tissue samples available on which to build a personalized blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Natera just announced its new tissue-free MRD test. This test would scan for common mutations found in specific cancer types. So, it's not bespoke to a patient's individual cancer. The idea is to help patients who had surgery long ago, or those who can't undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less exact than Signatera, Natera's Brophy said. The tissue-free blood test catches about 86% of the cancers that Signatera finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other challenges include tumors that don't spill as much DNA into the bloodstream. Lung cancer has been a difficult target. These tumors are known as low-shedders. There are also cancers that have fewer mutations. Personalis' Chen says this is where the ultrasensitive approach pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT screens for up to 1,800 mutations associated with cancer, compared with first-generation blood tests which look for 16 to 50 mutations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Eltoukhy, Guardant Health's CEO, says the technology is only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As the technology gets more sensitive, you get better at all of them," he said. "You'll get really, really good at the high-shedding ones and, then, better at the low-shedding ones. You'll still have that differential, but you'll get better at all of them over time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Growing Market For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a huge market for blood tests to monitor for cancer relapse, says Eltoukhy. Though there are tools in place to monitor cancer survivors, it can be tricky to navigate the Byzantine health care system for which tool to use and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are some diseases where they may scan every six months, every three months in the first year, first two years. Others where it may be annual. It's been a sort of mishmash of different available tools, whatever seems to work best for that specific cancer type," he said. "But the follow-on hasn't been, I would say, as set in stone and standardized as maybe treatment guidelines are for metastatic patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should take into account the newness of the technology, combined with the growing rates of cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's huge and growing," Personalis' Chen said of the MRD testing market. "I think we're only scratching the surface. It's still early days for MRD. It's a new technology. People are still getting used to what it can do."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001m3b73hsbgavyo@published"&gt;My daughters, ages 2 and 3, generally get along. They have similar interests, and both have a sense of humor. However when it comes to sharing, whether it’s me, a prized toy, or a spot at the sink to wash their hands, it often quickly turns into the 2-year-old hitting or pulling hair in an attempt to get her way. As you can imagine, this causes the 3-year-old to start screaming, then her sister starts screaming, then the 3-year-old starts crying, then they both are crying … you get the picture. The 3-year-old will hit back if I don’t get in there fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001n3b73vumldnrq@published"&gt;My question is: how do I intervene in a way that improves and supports their relationship? I always immediately pull the 2-year-old off of her sister and give the usual talk about how &lt;em&gt;hands are not for hitting and we don’t hit people&lt;/em&gt;, and of course check to make sure everyone is ok. I keep seeing parenting advice about not intervening every time your kids fight because it doesn’t give them an opportunity to learn how to problem solve. However, what do you do when almost every fight involves someone getting hurt?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001q3b73d74n5awu@published"&gt;You’re doing the right thing by intervening immediately when it comes to violence. Problem solving is one thing, but I’m not familiar with any parenting advice that suggests letting them slug it out. Personally, I stop behavior in kids if it would be considered illegal for adults to do. We’re not allowed to go around hitting people. They shouldn’t be either. That goes for verbal assault too! Of course, good luck explaining to a two-year-old that an adult would get arrested for doing what they’re doing. Still, it doesn’t hurt to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001r3b73gntkgqlz@published"&gt;My layperson-armchair-psychology take is that the two year old is hitting because they are younger and don’t feel like they have a non-violent way to assert themselves. She’s probably smaller and not as good with words yet. Work with her on other ways to assert herself without resorting to fisticuffs. The moment you intervene, ask her if she can think of another way to get what she wants without hitting. See if you can get her to explain what her intentions were. For example, “I hit because I wanted to play with the slinky.” Also try to get her sister involved in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam3001s3b73951rvsj5@published"&gt;Identify upcoming situations in which they’ll have to share as early as you can and prepare them for it. Before they even get to the sink, talk to them about how they’re going to use their &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; to determine who gets to use it first and how they’re going to tell the other one when they’re finished. When there’s something big they’ll both want, you can even practice ahead of time with each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

However, we are in our early 70s now and are beginning to tire of it.  At this point, my son and daughter have seven kids between them ranging in age from eight to eighteen months. It’s no longer as easy as when it was just them and their spouses and two or three kids along with my sister and her husband and son.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20t002k3b73lbd9iwjq@published"&gt;When I raised the topic with my daughter, she became angry. She accused me of “cancelling Easter at the last moment and ruining things for the kids” and said she and her brother were counting on us to make Easter happen for them like we always have because our backyard is the “best and safest” choice for the egg hunt. A conversation with my son went similarly sideways and I ended up caving and agreeing to host Easter this year.  Do my husband and I have an obligation to continue this tradition until our grandkids have outgrown it?&lt;/p&gt;

Your son and daughter overreacted to the idea of not having Easter at your house.&lt;/p&gt;

If possible, try to decelerate your involvement instead. Maybe this year you just do less. Let them use the yard, but have your son and daughter do all the work. They are young! Ask them to help prepare your house ahead of time and ask them to bring all the food and drinks. You can focus on your grandkids when they’re over, and then on cleaning up the house after they leave (or you can even ask your kids to hire a cleaner to do it for you).&lt;/p&gt;

If you label yourself unable to host and generally exhausted, you might not see your grandkids as much as you’d like. And, while you might get tired from hosting a bunch of grandchildren, remember that they’ll be forming lasting memories of you. Don’t take that away from them just because their parents are being ungrateful or lazy. Put more of the burden on the parents.&lt;/p&gt;

They have a big yard with lots of great egg-hiding places. My kids are old enough now to find egg hunts a little dull and my in-laws are in their late 70s, but we still keep the tradition alive and invite friends with younger kids over too. These days my wife and I pitch in and try to do everything we can ahead of time, planning for a few weeks up to the day. We potluck it so that my in-laws don’t have to cook if they don’t want to. We help set up and help tear down. We know that it’s something the kids have done their entire lives and will remember fondly when they’re grown up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20u002q3b73dnmlbwtx@published"&gt;From a broader perspective, your kids’ overreaction to Easter does not bode well for the future. You need to prepare them for the idea of taking care of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; instead of the other way around. Talk to them seriously about how as you age you’ll be able to handle less and less, but that your aging doesn’t mean you don’t want to see them—just that you’ll need more help. Look at Easter as an opportunity to practice coming to a compromise that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For six years, Ziska and a large team of research colleagues in China and the US grew rice in controlled fields, subjecting it to varying levels of carbon dioxide and temperature. They found that when both increased, in line with projections by climate scientists, the amount of arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice grains also went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is found naturally in some foods, including fish and shellfish, and in waters and soils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic arsenic is found in industrial materials and gets into water—including water used to submerge rice paddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice is easily inundated with weeds and other crops, but it has one advantage: It grows well in water. So farmers germinate the seeds, and when the seedlings are ready, plant them in wet soil. They then flood their fields, which suppresses weeds, but allows the rice to flourish. Rice readily absorbs the water and everything in it—including arsenic, either naturally occurring or not. Most of the world’s rice is grown this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research demonstrates that climate change will ramp up those levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What happens in rice, because of complex biogeochemical processes in the soil, when temperatures and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; go up, inorganic arsenic also does,” Ziska said. “And it’s this inorganic arsenic that poses the greatest health risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Research has found that in parts of the world with high consumption of rice, inorganic arsenic increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 people, measuring three biomarkers over a 17-year period and comparing results between those who developed dementia and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age was associated with higher levels of all three biomarkers, while differences were also seen between men and women and before and after menopause. These findings highlight the potential of tailoring blood-based dementia diagnostics based on individual factors like sex and hormonal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Older individuals had significantly higher levels of dementia-related biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Women showed higher glial protein levels; men had more neurofilament proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menopause Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-menopausal women had higher glial protein levels, possibly due to hormone effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found important clues about the roles age, sex, hormonal changes and genetics play in how certain biomarkers for dementia are expressed in the blood, according to a study published on April 16, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood tests that detect biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are emerging and as these tests are further developed, they are becoming important tools for understanding and diagnosing these conditions,” said study author Hannah Stocker, PhD, MPH, of Heidelberg University in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108847"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers also found that female participants had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, while male participants had higher levels of neurofilament light chain proteins. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide valuable insights into how age, sex, genetics and hormonal changes during menopause are linked to three biomarkers believed to influence a person’s risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from a larger 17-year study, comparing 513 people who developed dementia during the study to 513 people who remained free of dementia during that time. The participants had an average age of 64 at the start of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers took blood samples from participants three times during the study to measure levels of three biomarkers: neurofilament light chain proteins, glial acidic proteins and phosphorylated tau 181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain proteins are found in the blood when nerve cells are injured or die. Glial acidic proteins are released when cells work to repair injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylated tau 181 is linked to the buildup of amyloid proteins in the body, which occurs in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared levels of the biomarkers in people with and without dementia in the following ways: over time as people aged; in male and female participants; in people with and without a gene linked to Alzheimer’s; and in female participants before and after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, and APOEe4, a genetic biomarker that indicates a strong risk of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers found that an older age was tied to higher levels of all three markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For neurofilament light chain proteins, people age 75 had an average of 25 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) compared to people age 50 with an average of 10 pg/ml. For glial acidic proteins, people age 75 had an average of 140 pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 45 pg/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For phosphorylated tau 181, people age 75 had an average of two to three pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 0.5 to 1.5 pg/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that female participants had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, while male participants had higher levels of neurofilament light chain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they found people who had the APOEe4 gene had higher levels of tau and glial acidic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the study found that female participants who had not yet gone through menopause had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, which Stocker noted may be due to having higher levels of sex hormones. Stocker said previous studies have found a link between sex hormones and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaining a better understanding of these biomarkers will help improve our ability to test for dementia in the future with simple blood tests,” said Stocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research underscores the need to further explore these biomarkers, including during menopause, in the development of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that participants were of European descent, so the results may not be the same for other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the German Alzheimer Forschung Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#026c616d6c7063664263636c2c616d6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:30:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5Vb3pCLWpFd2FvOEhFRUJuRk9XcVFpZEROYlM0amVQNmc1OFN5aHNkUzhLZ1RWMHl2aExrRWNqVjlFM0k5Zk9SQU5YYzI2TFFQaHRJZHB2SmdIc1hwcEhVcHZBQnIyYWY0d0xZRWhOQ3BGUVJrMFg5dUd3</guid></item><item><title>大豆是否应该被禁止进入美国自助餐厅？法国食品安全局的回应敲响了风险的警钟和警告！ -银河日报 | Should Soybeans Be Banned from American Cafeterias?

&lt;p&gt;France’s national food safety authority has issued a stark recommendation that could impact menus across the country’s &lt;strong&gt;public institutions&lt;/strong&gt;. The Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail&lt;strong&gt; (Anses)&lt;/strong&gt; has raised concerns over the risks of excessive soy consumption, particularly in the context of mass catering services like &lt;strong&gt;school cafeterias&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hospitals&lt;/strong&gt;, and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Soy Is Under Renewed Scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy-based products&lt;/strong&gt; like soy&lt;em&gt; milk&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; tofu&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;miso&lt;/em&gt; have become increasingly visible in Western diets. Long a staple in Asian cuisine, soy is especially popular among vegetarian and vegan consumers due to its high content of &lt;strong&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite its popularity, soy is a controversial food. Its composition includes phytoestrogens, specifically &lt;strong&gt;isoflavones&lt;/strong&gt;, which are naturally occurring compounds known to have estrogen-like hormonal activity. According to Anses, high levels of isoflavones can have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/nasas-worst-fear-martian-dust-is-way-deadlier-than-you-think/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85206" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;toxic effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The agency has now formally recommended that soy products no longer be served in public catering facilities, regardless of age group. This measure, Anses states in its &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/content/eviter-les-isoflavones-dans-les-menus-des-restaurations-collectives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;March 24, 2025 publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, aims to avoid overconsumption of foods rich in isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Would Be Affected by the Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation would apply to a wide range of institutions. The list includes&lt;em&gt; day-care centers, preschools, primary and secondary schools,&lt;/em&gt; colleges, universities, hospitals, nursing homes, vacation centers, and &lt;strong&gt;prisons&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts cited in the report highlight that high soy intake may extend the length of &lt;strong&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/strong&gt; in women and reduce testosterone levels in men, with potential negative effects on &lt;strong&gt;fertility&lt;/strong&gt;. In children, the concern is focused on the possibility of hormonal disruption during development due to prolonged exposure to isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Anses points out that isoflavones, although naturally found in many plants, are especially concentrated in soy—which remains the primary known source of these compounds in the human diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Soy Already Has Limited Use in Collective Catering&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the gravity of Anses’ warning, soy is not currently a major player in collective catering. The publication &lt;strong&gt;60 Millions de Consommateurs&lt;/strong&gt; recently reported that the Syndicat national de la restauration collective has responded to Anses, stating that crèches no longer use soy-based products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In school cafeterias, soy is already used in a very limited capacity. It is only included as part of the &lt;strong&gt;vegetarian menu experiment&lt;/strong&gt; outlined by the Conseil national de la restauration collective, which allows one soy-based meal for every five vegetarian meals served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This limited frequency already reflects an effort to manage soy intake across age groups, but Anses is now recommending more decisive action to ensure population-wide protection from &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/5-signs-youre-eating-too-much-sugar/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71991" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hormonal risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Reduce Soy Exposure Without Cutting Plant Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anses emphasizes that it is entirely possible to reduce exposure to isoflavones while maintaining a &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/diet-changes-reduce-heart-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7330" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy, plant-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;. One strategy is to diversify plant protein sources—for example, by replacing soy with &lt;strong&gt;legumes&lt;/strong&gt; such as lentils or beans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency also notes the importance of distinguishing between different soy-based products, as isoflavone levels vary widely. Some soy snacks, like &lt;strong&gt;soy-based crackers&lt;/strong&gt;, can contain 100 times more isoflavones than other products like soy sauce, which is typically fermented and used in small quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These insights suggest that consumers and institutions alike can reduce risk not only by lowering overall soy intake, but also by choosing products more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, based on longitudinal data from nearly 5,000 women, suggest that early menopause may be an independent risk factor for dementia, even after accounting for depression and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with later menopause performed better on memory and orientation tests than men, while hormone replacement therapy showed no significant cognitive effect. The study adds to growing evidence that sex-specific factors influence dementia risk and may help inform future prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Menopause Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Women entering menopause before age 40 showed worse cognitive outcomes than those after 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No HRT Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Hormone replacement therapy did not improve cognitive function in this study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Women with later menopause outperformed men in cognitive tasks, highlighting unique risk profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tohoku University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team of researchers from the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science found that women who entered menopause before the age of 40 had worse cognitive outcomes than women who entered menopause after the age of 50. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may be useful for clinicians, when assessing their patient’s risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108843"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/early-menopause-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results imply that women who experience early menopause may constitute a sex-specific high-risk group for cognitive decline.

However, direct evidence regarding the impact of earlier menopause on the age-related trajectories of depressive symptoms and cognitive function is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, classifying age at menopause into three categories: &amp;lt;40, 40-49, and ≥50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 4,726 women and 4,286 men who were assessed in measures of cognitive functioning such as orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and verbal fluency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested the association between sex and age at menopause, and cognitive functioning two years later after adjusting baseline modifiable risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When looking for associations, we want to rule out as many other modifiable risk factors for dementia as possible,” explains lead author Miharu Nakanishi (Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since early menopause increases the risk of depression, which then increases the risk of dementia, we had to control for this factor to determine if early menopause in of itself was a direct risk factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After controlling for baseline outcome measures and other covariates (such as other modifiable dementia risk factors), menopause at &amp;lt;40 years, compared with ≥50 years, was significantly associated with worse 2-year follow-up orientation, as well as immediate and delayed recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function in women who entered menopause at ≥50 years old was actually better than the comparison group of men. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (a treatment to minimize menopausal symptoms) was not associated with cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results imply that women who experience early menopause may constitute a sex-specific high-risk group for cognitive decline. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between levels of female hormones and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding this relationship in-depth could potentially help us design treatments that delay the onset of dementia in at-risk patients,” says Nakanishi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this menopause and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#601015020c09033f12050c0114090f0e13200712104e140f080f0b154e01034e0a10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Public Relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tohoku.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tohoku University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Public Relations – Tohoku University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Menopause at an Early Age Can Exacerbate Cognitive Decline&lt;/a&gt;” by Miharu Nakanishi et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menopause at an Early Age Can Exacerbate Cognitive Decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70063-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is scarce regarding the role of menopause in age-related cognitive function trajectories associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a new type of visual prosthesis system in which nanoparticles, used in combination with a small laser device worn in a pair of glasses or goggles, might one day help people with retinal disorders to see again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification,” said Jiarui Nie, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health who led the research while completing her Ph.D. at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie performed the work while working in the lab of Jonghwan Lee, an associate professor in Brown’s School of Engineering and a faculty affiliate at Brown’s Carney Institute for Brain Science, who oversaw the work and served as the study’s senior author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions damage light-sensitive cells in the retina called photoreceptors — the “rods” and “cones” that convert light into tiny electric pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pulses stimulate other types of cells further up the visual chain called bipolar and ganglion cells, which process the photoreceptor signals and send them along to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach uses nanoparticles injected directly into the retina to bypass damaged photoreceptors. When infrared light is focused on the nanoparticles, they generate a tiny amount of heat that activates bipolar and ganglion cells in much the same way that photoreceptor pulses do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because disorders like macular degeneration affect mostly photoreceptors while leaving bipolar and ganglion cells intact, the strategy has the potential to restore lost vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the research team tested the nanoparticle approach in mouse retinas and in living mice with retinal disorders. After injecting a liquid nanoparticle solution, the researchers used patterned near-infrared laser light to project shapes onto the retinas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a calcium signal to detect cellular activity, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles were exciting bipolar and ganglion cells in patterns matched the shapes projected by the laser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments showed that neither the nanoparticle solution nor the laser stimulation caused detectable adverse side effects, as indicated by metabolic markers for inflammation and toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using probes, the researchers confirmed that laser stimulation of the nanoparticles caused increased activity in the visual cortices of the mice — an indication that previously absent visual signals were being transmitted and processed by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, the researchers say, is a sign that vision had been at least partially restored, a good sign for potentially translating a similar technology to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For human use, the researchers envision a system that combines the nanoparticles with a laser system mounted in a pair of glasses or goggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameras in the goggles would gather image data from the outside world and use it to drive the patterning of an infrared laser. The laser pulses would then stimulate the nanoparticles in people’s retinas, enabling them to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is similar to one that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use a few years ago. The older approach combined a camera system with a small electrode array that was surgically implanted in the eye. The nanoparticle approach has several key advantages, according to Nie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, it’s far less invasive. As opposed to surgery, “an intravitreal injection is one of the simplest procedures in ophthalmology,” Nie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are functional advantages as well. The resolution of the previous approach was limited by the size of the electrode array — about 60 square pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the nanoparticle solution covers the whole retina, the new approach could potentially cover someone’s full field of vision. And because the nanoparticles respond to near-infrared light as opposed to visual light, the system doesn’t necessarily interfere with any residual vision a person may retain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done before the approach can be tried in a clinical setting, Nie said, but this early research suggests that it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity,” Nie said of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system.

                                        Three people in a county in Oregon are believed to have acquired Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disease with a 100% fatality rate, two of whom have since died. Symptoms are similar to those of Alzheimer's disease but CJD progresses faster, with death usually occurring within a year. The disease can only be confirmed after death by examining brain tissue and the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, a process that can take months, per the &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Health officials in Oregon's Hood River County say one case was confirmed by autopsy, while the two others are presumptive.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        CJD impacts just 1 to 2 people per million each year, so it's "statistically unusual" to see three cases in a county of 24,000, per &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/100-percent-fatal-brain-disease-strikes-3-people-in-oregon"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;. "At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases," health officials say. They add CJD can only be spread from person to person through organ or tissue transplants or unusual exposure to contaminated tissue. There are several types of CJD, which is caused by prions, or abnormally folded proteins, that damage brain tissue.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        About 85% of cases are sporadic, with normal proteins spontaneously morphing into prions for unknown reasons, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. In most other cases, CJD is traced to inherited mutations of the PRNP gene, which provides instructions for making the prion protein. Less than 1% of cases are acquired, with prions entering the body from external sources, such as in eating beef from cows infected with mad cow disease. Officials in Hood River say infected cattle are unlikely to be the cause, per the &lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;. The department is investigating alongside the Oregon Health Authority and CDC.

Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are all carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin first learned that lead was added to toothpaste about 12 years ago while working with families that had children with high levels of the metal in their blood. The common denominator among them was a brand of toothpaste, Earthpaste, that contained lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year she detected high levels in some toothpaste using an XRF lead detection tool. The levels were high enough to raise concern, and she crowdfunded with readers to send popular brands to an independent laboratory for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those found to contain the toxins were Crest, Sensodyne, Tom’s of Maine, Dr Bronner’s, Davids, Dr Jen and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So far, none of the companies Lead Safe Mama checked have said they will work to get lead out of their product, Rubin said. Several sent her cease-and-desist letters, which she said she ignored, but also &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/just-ingredients-sends-lead-safe-mama-llc-a-cease-desist-letter-february-2025-read-the-full-letter-here-please-comment-with-your-reaction-below/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on her blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some companies have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DGAjitsOemW/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;defended themselves&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DFb9gnEOD2P/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that lead &lt;a href="https://wellnesse.com/pages/wellnesse-toothpaste-rebuttal?srsltid=AfmBOopmOTTRa-FH1kxDxHwiCuLqulrWwyXbXUF0uK7bSxIdDZb4aPOz" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is found&lt;/a&gt; in trace levels throughout the environment and is impossible to avoid. Others &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/responses-from-toothpaste-companies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have said&lt;/a&gt; the levels Rubin found are not concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The federal Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, which is stalled in Congress, called for lead limits in kids’ food or personal care products like toothpaste of five parts per billion (ppb). California’s limit on lead in baby food is two ppb, but it does not include toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most toothpastes exceeded those thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA’s current lead limit for children is 10,000 ppb, and 20,000 ppb for adults. None exceeded the FDA limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The state of Washington recently enacted a law with 1,000 ppb limits – several exceeded that and have been reported, Rubin said, but companies have time to get in compliance with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Crest’s parent company, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin said the contamination seems to lie in some ingredients added to toothpaste, including hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and bentonite clay. Hydroxyapatite is extracted from cow bone and added because it allegedly helps teeth absorb calcium, though Rubin said she doubts it does. Calcium carbonate is added to help remove stains from teeth. Bentonite clay is a cleaning agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those with the highest levels all had bentonite clay. Meanwhile, Rubin’s testing of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate as individual ingredients showed concerning levels of lead and other metals, suggesting those are the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several children’s toothpastes, like Dr Brown’s Baby Toothpaste, did not test positive for any metals and did not contain the ingredients in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPSmdaSnZOTFY0UTFpZG8zQ2VvblRaNTRGczM3T1Z2QkNBZkk1OEdBUnFZemhhTndua1N1cldqVWJsXzdvTGU4enFnTG8zaW5TbmZvVEYzUHpuNVhpeTF6Tmw2bkl4X2ZnVWo4M3prSkk0cERBeDY0M183OHBDX3BRbjdR</guid></item><item><title>“瓶中运动”药物帮助身体燃烧更多脂肪，更有效地利用能量-新闻的光明面 | ‘Exercise in a bottle’ drug helps the body burn more fat, use energy more efficiently - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPbXBZUXAtU3ZCWk1IMWRPRTRNVHBTOGt2X0VYanE1Y0lhaWQ1ZHRnWERDMmlIVG5Zd2NRNGxtQkgwbl9xTU9XWDJIQkJnV1dZbmt6M3A5V2cxOFFUdUVQRkpVRXp2eTJhdHJBdF9xenpENjhZOUltcmQ2XzZ0SFVkYnpBNXJESkQ4TDRzbURiWXdlSEhPX1kxN3lXaEI5Y0xLVXNsX2ltLUtXM3NCVGNubjViOU1MMHZDQW1kV1NiZTk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new drug may one day help fight obesity and related diseases by mimicking the benefits of aerobic exercise—without the need to move a muscle. Scientists at &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have developed a compound called SLU-PP-332 that shows strong promise in helping the body burn more fat, use energy more efficiently, and reduce insulin resistance, especially in conditions like metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no pill can replace the full value of physical activity, new research suggests that certain molecules can copy key changes exercise brings about inside your muscles.

(CREDIT: ScienceDirect) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes SLU-PP-332 special is that it activates all three types of ERRs—α, β, and γ—which together help boost the body's energy use, fat burning, and muscle endurance. In studies using mice, this drug increased the type of muscle fibers that are most resistant to fatigue. That means animals on the drug could exercise longer without getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits weren’t limited to performance. Mice given SLU-PP-332 showed &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-identify-a-new-way-to-combat-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;lower fat buildup&lt;/a&gt;, better use of fatty acids for energy, and improved blood sugar control. These changes are hallmarks of what the body normally experiences after weeks or months of regular aerobic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_science_of_how_it_works"&gt;The science of how it works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why SLU-PP-332 works so well, it helps to know how skeletal muscle uses energy. Depending on the situation, your muscles can switch between using sugar (glucose) and fat (fatty acids) as fuel. Short bursts of activity rely on sugar, while long, low-intensity movement tends to use fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise shifts this balance. The longer you move, the more your muscles rely on fat. This switch also encourages your cells to build more mitochondria—the tiny engines that convert food into energy. More mitochondria mean more endurance, better sugar use, and less fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLU-PP-332 triggers many of the same pathways. It boosts fat use in muscles, helps them become more efficient, and supports overall metabolic health. These effects are especially important in diseases like obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/zinc-levels-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which involve poor fat breakdown and reduced muscle energy capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice fed a high-fat diet and then treated with SLU-PP-332 showed less weight gain, improved energy use while resting, and better results on glucose tolerance tests. That means their bodies processed sugar more like healthy, fit animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERRs belong to the same family as estrogen receptors but don't bind to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/egg-and-soybean-consumption-linked-to-aggressive-type-of-cancer/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; itself. Instead, they’re active all the time and are key players in how cells manage energy. They help control genes involved in fat burning, mitochondrial growth, and cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, scientists have tested mice with changes in ERR function. Mice missing ERRβ die before birth. Those without ERRα or ERRγ develop problems like heart failure. On the flip side, mice that overexpress ERRγ in their muscles grow more oxidative muscle fibers and can exercise for longer periods. This makes ERRs attractive drug targets for diseases that involve energy failure, like obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long suspected that activating these receptors with drugs could mimic some of the changes brought on by aerobic exercise. SLU-PP-332 was built to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earlier tests, it showed up in both blood and muscle tissue at levels high enough to cause these effects. Even six hours after being injected into mice, the drug was still found at measurable concentrations in muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="beyond_weight_loss_future_medical_potential"&gt;Beyond weight loss: Future medical potential&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bahaa Elgendy, a professor of anesthesiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, leads the research. Elgendy shared that the goal isn’t to replace exercise. “We cannot replace exercise; exercise is important on all levels… But there are so many cases in which a substitute is needed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with muscle wasting due to aging, cancer, or &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-ai-based-system-significantly-reduces-ivf-related-miscarriages-genetic-disorders/"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt;, exercise might not be possible. That’s where a drug like SLU-PP-332 could be a game-changer. By simulating the metabolic changes triggered by physical activity, it may help maintain strength and health in people who can't stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer versions of SLU-PP-332 have also been developed. These next-gen compounds bind more strongly to ERRs and lead to even greater changes in gene activity. In lab tests, they outperformed the original version of the drug, suggesting that even more powerful exercise mimetics could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;SLU-PP-332 does not improve glucose metabolism in vivo in chow-fed mice.

For example, other studies have shown that ERRα activation helps improve fatty liver disease in mice. There's even evidence that ERRs play a role in fighting cognitive decline. Although SLU-PP-332 doesn’t cross into the brain, other ERR-activating drugs might be able to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-can-improve-brain-function-and-protect-against-diabetes-and-alzheimers/"&gt;protect neurons&lt;/a&gt; and slow conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="building_toward_the_next_phase"&gt;Building toward the next phase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is still in its early stages, but the team has big plans. Elgendy and colleagues, in partnership with a biotech startup called Pelagos Pharmaceuticals, are preparing to test new compounds in animals with various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to explore how these drugs affect aging-related decline, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mri-scan-can-identify-patients-at-risk-for-serious-heart-problems/"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly brain health.

Instead of simply &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/surprising-study-finds-inverse-relationship-between-exercise-and-daily-activity/"&gt;burning calories&lt;/a&gt;, exercise shapes how your cells work, what fuels they prefer, and how strong your tissues can be.

It’s more common to have contaminated greens “when the field is in close proximity to livestock farms or feedlots where animals are being held in densely populated conditions,” Roszkowski explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arizona and California are big producers of leafy greens in the United States and are often near large cattle operations, according to Detwiler. E. coli, salmonella, or listeria can be introduced to the crops through contaminated irrigation water from nearby cattle farms, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Runoff from manure lagoons can seep into irrigation canals and contaminate fields with deadly bacteria like E. coli O157:H7,” Detwiler continued.

And it’s not only contaminated water that can be a problem. Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the processing plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lettuce is washed in large vats, added &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rosemary Trout," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosemary Trout,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts &amp;amp; Food Science at Drexel University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the journey to store shelves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will washing prewashed salad greens help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re thinking, “W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ell, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for buying bagged greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for recalls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detwiler and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throw them away immediately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy heads of lettuce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purchasing a head of lettuce or a bunch of spinach may have the extra step of rinsing and drying before tossing in a salad bowl or stir-frying, but you could be minimizing the risk of lurking pathogens. “Whole heads of lettuce or spinach have less surface area for contamination compared to pre-cut, mixed bagged greens,” Detwiler said. He suggests rinsing them under cold water — not soaking — to remove dirt, debris, any insects and surface-level bacteria. “Wash them at home before eating.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:00:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPTUxNR2pyc1BSVjNyTjhmTUtiY01XdG16d3UxSUVMMjlDVWdqMmR6WE53dV9CVXBnXzBzN09SZWNpX19sTnE2dmU3OHd5RXZILWJfaFVKVFQ3QkpJTlRyR1pueU1rdTlZZzlDaWNpYVpBT0RoZW80SmlGTjU3UXpxR3ByalB4WnhZbnAzVV9YYjNWdUXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTTdRamdQMDFPLXl3Rkd3ZGxybGZ6TUpvZDhnUVJVSmFTNGFJMlA5ZXotSUNsTVVwblc4elp6Y05fcTk5NGUwejJETUpQcE0wUFlpNFdQQXlpWDdWSklaWmRjZFczdmM2SllvbEdrcVVCWjFlV1Mxam1TQjBacTN1czJQSUZqTFJOaVdTSTBqU0EzcTgxYjZYUVg</guid></item><item><title>我的朋友一直在我们的孩子面前做一件非常可怕的事情。我需要这个来停止。-石板 | My Friend Keeps Doing a Really Awful Thing in Front of Our Kids.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="207" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9cn0024357592lvbvu8@published"&gt;I know the general rule is don’t comment on other people’s parenting and don’t give unsolicited parenting advice. But! Can you ask a parent to change the way they behave in front of you and your kid? I have some friends, “Elo” and “Raven,” whose 3-year-old, “Jax,” is one of my 3-year-old’s best friends. Elo and Raven divorced when Jax was about 1 ½—thank god, because the tension was through the roof when we all hung out. I love hanging out with Elo and Jax, but I really struggle when I spend time with Raven. Jax has autism and some developmental delays, but in many ways they also behave like any other 3-year-old. Jax is verbal, responds to questions and redirection, and is constantly learning and changing. Every time I see them, I can tell they’ve made leaps in their development, even if their speech and reactions are not the same as a neurotypical 3-year-old. But Raven is always making comments in front of Jax and my child about how Jax “doesn’t understand anything that goes on around them,” and constantly compares our kids: “oh, it’s so nice that your kid takes turns/is calm/knows their name; Jax doesn’t know how to do that and probably never will.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9g200253575tagb29nf@published"&gt;It’s painful to witness, because it’s so clear that Jax understands everything, even if their responses are not exactly the same as my kid’s. I’m sure it’s self-preservation from having a child with more challenges than Raven expected, but Jax is a smart, sweet kid and Raven needs to see that! I don’t want my child to hear Raven comparing them with Jax. I don’t think it’s appropriate, and I want them to stop doing it. I also want them to stop telling me Jax doesn’t understand anything. Can I ask for these boundaries to be in place when my child and I are present? I’m thinking about writing Raven a letter, because they generally don’t respond well to feedback. It doesn’t feel appropriate to involve Elo even though Elo is also Jax’s parent, because Elo and Raven are divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9oo002a3575nvi521t1@published"&gt;This would bum me out, too. As the fellow parent of an autistic child, the most generous (possibly too generous?) interpretation I can muster is that Raven may be in pretty ableist medical and/or educational environments that encourage them to do exactly what they’re doing: compare their kid to others, and pay more attention to deficits than strengths. Of course, Raven is allowed to have feelings about Jax’s autism or the support they need. And sure, at least some of Raven’s comments are probably the result of processing those thoughts and feelings aloud, with someone they assume will be somewhat sympathetic (you).&lt;br&gt;But there’s what you feel, and then there’s what you do with those feelings. Raven is making whatever problems she’s having Jax’s problems, too (and yours!). It just isn’t appropriate to vent your fears or frustrations about your disabled 3-year-old in front of said 3-year-old—sorry, but you’ve gotta pick a different time, a different place, a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9sh002b3575febf7hp5@published"&gt;When encountering ableist parents (and it’s always sadder but unsurprising to me when they have disabled kids themselves), I usually go with one of two options. The easy one is distance: If the relationship isn’t super important to me, I might just let it go, because my time is finite and I don’t need to expose myself or my kid to any more ableism than we already encounter. The other option is (somewhat grudging) education—I don’t mean that I try to engage them in Disability 101 or whatever, but I’ll correct false assertions or push back when needed. I might go so far as to explain why something they said about autism is wrong, or perhaps cite a source like the &lt;a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/"&gt;Autistic Self-Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;. I have also had to ask some parents to talk to their own kids about ableism, after those kids said or did something harmful to my kid. Sometimes, though, these things lead us back to distance—either because the other parent/family’s ableism is a dealbreaker for me, or because the other parent just finds me super annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9ui002c3575p94kslvp@published"&gt;This is all to say that if you don’t want to hear ableist stuff from a fellow parent, and you don’t want your kid hearing it, either—or taking your silence for agreement—I think it’s OK for you to say something. And I don’t even really think it is about Jax’s parenting; it’s more about how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to parent your own child. You seem to want them to appreciate and enjoy all kinds of people. You don’t want them to grow up ableist. You don’t want them to think worse of Jax or other kids like them—you want them to respect and see whatever is good in every kid they meet, and not assume that autistic or disabled kids can’t be smart or fun or wonderful friends.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9xh002d35750dcsog6f@published"&gt;You can think about whether you really want to try to let Raven know about those things you want for your kid, and how—in a letter; in person; parent to parent; etc. But as you probably already know, it might not lead to the outcome you want. Raven might not be in a place where they can hear what you’re saying, or view their situation differently. They might also get mad at you, no matter how kind or careful you try to be. And in the end, they’re going to parent how they choose to parent, and they and Jax will bear the consequences. If they keep making their ableist remarks and it turns out to be a dealbreaker for you, then you may need to decide whether your kid mostly sees Jax during Elo’s time rather than Raven’s. You don’t have the power to change Raven, but you do get to choose what &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; willing to put up with, and what you want your child to hear and absorb.&lt;/p&gt;

It was obviously devastating. My heart is broken for her. I live on the other side of the country, so I haven’t been able to be as present as I would like. I’m planning a trip over the summer to her coast and I definitely want to see her, but I’m struggling with how to plan the trip without overburdening her and her husband. Normally, I would just ask to stay with them for a few days, but I don’t know if they would want a house guest. But I also think she might be upset if I say I’m staying at an Airbnb in their town. They live pretty far away from other friends I could stay with, but it wouldn’t be impossible to meet for lunch somewhere in the middle. How can I plan this trip to maximize support but minimize stress for them? I just want to give her a hug and make them a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeah3002j3575xgk0k4ee@published"&gt;It’s kind of you to want to offer in-person support to your friend, assuming she is open to it. I understand why you might prefer not to ask, but in this case, I think there’s no avoiding it—not if you actually want to ascertain and respect her wishes. Unless you talk about it with her, you’re reduced to guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

And I think you can try to bring up the possibility of a visit in a way that puts the least amount of pressure on her. First, let her know that you’re planning to be in the area, and you’d love to see her if she has time. And then just make it clear that you’d be open to doing so in whatever way would be best for her, perhaps something like: “Of course I’d be glad to stay with you, but I’m also very happy to stay somewhere else if that’s easier. I can come over and make a meal, or we can meet for lunch if you’d prefer. Think about it and let me know—I hope to see and catch up, and also have this visit be as easy as possible for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

Then your friend will know all the options and have time to think it over; she won’t feel the pressure of needing to answer right away. She can let you know how she’s feeling about the visit, and what she’d like to do, as your trip gets closer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeayx002o35752zv6ibad@published"&gt;My 2-year-old is on a pretty hardcore napping strike right now, after being a reliable two-hour napper for many months. The switch was sudden despite no major life changes. She is my fourth child, so I know a lot of the recommendations already (keep naptime consistent, darken the room, remove distractions) and follow them—I just have not had a child do this before. I have a childproof lock over the doorknob and she will stay in her room for over an hour for “rest,” but she rarely sleeps. I plan to keep enforcing “rest time” and hope she goes back to napping eventually, but in the meantime, do you know anyone who has had a similar experience and lived to tell the tale? Did their kid go back to napping?&lt;/p&gt;

My younger child was never a great napper, and gave it up somewhere between 2 and 2 ½. We referred to that last hour or so before her 7pm bedtime as witching hour, because, well, none of us were at our best. In our case, once the nap was gone, it never came back. But of course it’s possible that your child is just on a nap strike, and will eventually go back to sleeping during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if your 2-year-old doesn’t fall asleep, the chill quiet time is probably good for her (and for you). It can also flow nicely into her having chunks of increasingly independent time, when she doesn’t expect you or anyone else to entertain her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjebez002u3575ykwmj86d@published"&gt;My wife and I have a dilemma: My mom lives just downstairs from us and is 90 percent awesome with our 5-year-old son. She helps with school drop-off and pickup, does a few hours of child care on the weekend, and is always ready to randomly babysit whenever we need. The 10 percent: Whenever he goes down to visit her, he gets banana bread, trail mix with M&amp;amp;Ms, lemonade (not cut with water or seltzer), and other things we would consider “sometimes” foods. The notorious “free” babysitting strikes again! &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/06/parenting-advice-about-a-grandparent-who-gives-the-kids-sweets.html"&gt;What can we do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ketyms001f2cqj3bcvda58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases have surpassed 650 in an ongoing multistate outbreak, but federal funding cuts could threaten the response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00023b5vi593glth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday at a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00033b5vcdn5zhup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas – the epicenter of the outbreak – has sent several requests to the CDC for resources, Sugerman said, as response costs grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00053b5v82ynze77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC recently pulled back billions of dollars in Covid-19 pandemic-era grants that state and local health officials said were also being used to respond to other public health threats, like the measles outbreak. The US Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping layoffs two weeks ago, including an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html"&gt;2,400&lt;/a&gt; employees from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00063b5v8nlbnnmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In light of these cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/health/measles-outbreak-texas-response-challenges/index.html"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, says it has had to cancel over 50 immunization clinics. In New Mexico – where at least 63 measles cases have been reported – some staff that was responsible for order vaccines and checking vaccination records had to be let go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00043b5vjaswvobe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak is spreading within Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and Sugerman said the same genotyping sequence of the virus has been found in cases in Kansas and across international borders in Ontario, Canada, and Chihuahua, Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00083b5vhxl5hy2n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas is mobilizing its resources and moving staff from other areas and domains into the measles response area, Sugerman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00093b5v32hmrh2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But local officials say resource limitations are taking a toll on public health workers and the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000a3b5vi9arw0ez@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have to be able to do all of our other public health work, so it does become a strain on the system,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health. “Public health doesn’t have … a lot of duplication of staff, so … you’re asking a lot of staff to do additional work beyond their regular daily jobs. It just gets draining.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000b3b5v89ck4lja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that the effects of these funding cuts will be felt beyond the measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000c3b5vn6udkss1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Other types of care are going to be influenced by having to redirect these resources to the setting,” said Dr. Bryan Patenaude, an associate professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University. “In situations of scarcity where you have limited funding available for health overall, that’s going to place more and more pressure on those other disease areas that really have nothing to do with measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000e3b5v3uuv381o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            History has showed that the costs associated with an outbreak can accumulate in a short amount of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000f3b5v7evjztri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each measles case can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000g3b5vdax9yjbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This includes testing, laboratory work, contact tracing, vaccination efforts and health-care costs, according to Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000h3b5v7xn76xr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hospitalizations can also become quite expensive, she said. The outbreak has put 63 people in the hospital across Texas and New Mexico, with another hospitalization in Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000i3b5vxo1e3knu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cost is “going to depend on how severely ill the person is … how much treatment they need [and] how long they’re in the hospital,” Troisi said. Given the contagious nature of the airborne disease, measles cases in hospitals also require proper ventilation and isolation procedures, which add to costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9kh5ohr00023b6ow0rdj2wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to health-care and public health response, experts say there are a vast amount of indirect costs during an outbreak. For example, parents may need to take time off work to care for sick children, or there could be costs associated with transportation to and from facilities, Patenaude said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000j3b5vwa4cwjz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles can cause a variety of complications including ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis or death. It is especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000k3b5vyl2h9xnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been several hospitalized cases of pneumonia and at least one case of neurological symptoms from measles during this outbreak, according to Covenant Hospital in Lubbock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000l3b5v2b9c0s0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The more sick kids we see, it also increases the likelihood of seeing an additional death,” Wells said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000m3b5v84tgzy0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been three deaths reported in this outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico whose death is under investigation. They were all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

There’s a reason, after all, that oats have been eaten for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat oatmeal every day,” says dermatologist and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/hautarzt-muenchen/dr-med-christian-merkel/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/hautarzt-muenchen/dr-med-christian-merkel/"}' href="https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/hautarzt-muenchen/dr-med-christian-merkel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christian Merkel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/"}' href="https://www.haut-und-laser-zentrum.de/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skin and Laser Center&lt;/a&gt; in Munich, Germany. “For me, they are a real superfood—and totally underrated.” He notes that not only is oatmeal good for digestion—a key factor in overall health—but it also provides long-lasting feelings of satiety. Below, six reasons why oatmeal should be a regular star in your morning line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 health benefits of oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Lots of fiber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oatmeal contains a large amount of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it very good for healthy digestion,” says Merkel. The main type of fiber in oatmeal is a soluble type of fiber called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722849/" target="_blank"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, which has been shown to reduce blood glucose and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/insulin-resistance-aging" target="_blank"&gt;insulin response&lt;/a&gt;, regulate type 2 diabetes, and increase “good” bacteria in the gut. Pretty impressive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. High in vitamins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal is a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-k" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, which is essential for bone health and blood clotting. It also contains &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-multivitamin-for-women" target="_blank"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;—especially B1 (thiamine) and B5 (pantothenic acid)—which are essential for converting protein, carbohydrates, and fats into energy, supporting the digestive tract, making red blood cells, producing hormones, and for healthy skin and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Heart-healthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that oatmeal has been proven to lower cholesterol levels and can therefore also be beneficial against cardiovascular disease,” says Melker, noting that this is also thanks to beta-glucan, the soluble fiber in oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Rich in minerals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal contains essential minerals such as copper, zinc, calcium, and potassium. It’s also rich in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/magnesium-facts" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;—important for energy, sleep, muscles, protein formation, the nervous system, genes, and more—and is especially high in the inflammation-reducing trace mineral manganese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Good source of protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are a great &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-for-vegetarians" target="_blank"&gt;plant-based source of protein&lt;/a&gt;. “If you compare the nutritional values of different types of grains, you will find that the values of oatmeal are excellent,” says Merkel, noting that this helps balance out the carbohydrates. “The protein content is very good at 5.3 grams per half cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;6. Balances blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some glucose-experts &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/adapt-oatmeal-to-avoid-glucose-spikes" target="_blank"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt;, Merkel says oatmeal is a safe option for those wishing to keep their blood sugar in check. “There is virtually no sugar in oatmeal which means that your &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/glucose-energy-tips" target="_blank"&gt;insulin level&lt;/a&gt; will not rise quickly when you eat oatmeal,” he says. “Instead, there is a very slight, healthy rise in blood sugar and therefore long-lasting satiety.” Additionally, oats have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4690088/#:~:text=Oats%20are%20a%20good%20source,5%2C6%2C7%5D." target="_blank"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to lower blood sugar levels—especially in people with obesity or who have type 2 diabetes—thanks to good ol’ beta-glucan’s ability to slow the emptying of the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The healthiest way to eat oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to choose steel-cut whole oats instead of instant oats, which have less fiber and nutrients. Choose organic if possible. And, “bear in mind that a large proportion of the vitamins and trace elements are broken down during the cooking process,” says Merkel, who adds that the healthiest way to eat oats is actually “uncooked.” If that sounds a little too rustic for you, he recommends the two alternatives below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Overnight oats with almond milk, turmeric, cinnamon and blueberries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the overnight oats, place oats in a small bowl and pour in a plant-based drink of your choice until the oats are completely covered. “Personally, I’m a big fan of unsweetened almond milk because it has the best nutritional value of all plant-based drinks and the taste also appeals to most people,” says Merkel, who recommends enhancing the oats with nutritionally-rich spices such as &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cinnamon-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; and turmeric. “&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/turmeric-digestion-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/a&gt; is rich in antioxidants and just a teaspoon is enough to make breakfast even healthier,” he says. Cover the oats and leave them to soak in the refrigerator for eight to twelve hours. “In the morning, you can add another superfood in the form of blueberries. Dark berries are also rich in antioxidants,” suggests Merkel. “If you prepare your oatmeal in this way, you have a super healthy breakfast that is rich in fiber and antioxidants and, unlike packaged muesli, only gently raises your insulin levels and keeps you full for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Protein shake with oatmeal and fresh fruit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merkel says oats can be easily added to your usual &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dietitian-guide-to-liquid-protein" target="_blank"&gt;protein shake&lt;/a&gt; or smoothie for a boost of extra protein, nutrients, and fiber. “Add one to two tablespoons of uncooked rolled oats and some fresh fruit into the blender.

After 52 autopsies, scientists discovered microplastics in patients’ brains. They could even leech into the blood through the blood-brain barrier. Now, it doesn’t mean we need to remove all traces of plastic from our lives—that is physically impossible and mentally exhausting. But we can make some simple swaps to reduce exposure.

You’ll be hard-pressed to find a set without plastic lids, but this doesn’t bother me too much, especially when it comes to my top pick from Pyrex. It’s also one of our favorite glass container sets after rigorous testing. They seal well, are easy to clean and maintain a smooth, sleek finish and absorb no stains or smells.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mason jars are a must for the pantry and refrigerator. Take them on the go with berries, snacks or&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-popular-overnight-oat-recipes-8757821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; overnight oats&lt;/a&gt; stored inside. Or, use them to store pantry staples, dressings and prepped vegetables like carrots and jams. The jars make an excellent set because you get four jars in different sizes: two 16-ounce and two 32-ounce jars. They’re both wide-mouth, which means you’re not limited to a narrow lid for storing specific things you don’t need to reach in for, like sauces. They’re reusable, have a tight seal, and are so multi-purpose that you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have them.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is nice to have plastic wrap on hand, especially for food safety (i.e., raw meat or fish), but a lot of the time it can be replaced with this reusable beeswax wrap. Think: storing odds and ends of produce and bread, wrapping a bowl of a pre-made &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7963350/15-minute-summer-salad-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salad for a barbecue&lt;/a&gt;, sealing leftover butter—the list can go on. It seals using a sticky wax-based coating that is washable and reusable. Because you can cut pieces to the size you need, like plastic wrap, you’re not limited in terms of uses.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using plastic produce bags is arguably wasteful and unnecessary. These cotton mesh bags come in sizes between 12 x 15 inches and 8 x 10 inches and are made with a washable cotton material. They have a drawstring closure to keep your ingredients locked in. I love that they’re mesh because the ingredients can breathe, and you can easily see what’s inside. If you prefer an option with no holes, the brand offers&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Produce-Bags-Cotton-Washable/dp/B01HHBD3TY?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt; this cotton set&lt;/a&gt; for a similar price.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a good idea to replace plastic dressing containers with this set of glass jars. They’re a generous size at 2.6 ounces and are perfect for jams, sauces, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-most-saved-vinaigrette-recipes-8771585" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;homemade dressings&lt;/a&gt; and other condiments like ketchup. Plus, they’re completely leakproof: The plastic lid twists on tight, similar to a mason jar, so you can carry on without worrying about any sudden spills or drips if you’re on the go.

I prefer stainless steel straws like these because I know they’ll last and I can comfortably use them for hot drinks. With the included brush, they’re also easy to clean. I tend to wash them straight away, so I know I can get all of the remnants out immediately. (Dried, stuck-on bits are these straws' enemy.) I’ve had mine for years and they’re still as good as new. This set is only $7 and comes with 12 straws, so there’s plenty to go around all week.

Still, I never really knew what to replace them with. That is, until someone recommended this Epicurean Composite option to me. It’s made from Richlite paper, composed of—you guessed it—paper. It is fused with a form of resin to harden it, however thermosetting resins are a type of plastic that are more stable than typical plastics and don't leach microplastics under normal use.

Starting with a good quality option is ideal for easier maintenance, and we love this John Boos board. It’s 20 x 15 x 1.25 inches, so there’s a ton of surface area to work with, which is why it's our favorite larger option. It’s also designed to be double-sided, getting double the lifespan. Boos cutting boards are one of my favorite wooden options and I've used them often in professional kitchens because they’re well-made and durable.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I couldn’t go without these Pyrex bowls. Not only are they a better pick compared to plastic, they’re also more effective. They’re microwave- and dishwasher-safe, plus you can trust that they can hold hot things without breaking. Because they’re glass, they’re see-through, so I can see if anything needs to be mixed more, like a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-blueberry-oatmeal-muffins-8769989" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;homemade muffin&lt;/a&gt; batter. The lip on the edge also makes these maneuverable. With three different sizes, it’s an everyday essential. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
