&lt;p&gt;Cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have also been reported from India amid seasonal winter patterns of a rise in respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge of the cases in early December has raised global health concerns five years after the Covid-19 pandemic erupted in China. Both Beijing and the World Health Organization (WHO) have tried to allay concerns in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3429031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3429031" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3429031" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/INTERACTIVE-What-IS-HMPV-JAN8-2025-1736327184.png?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962" alt="INTERACTIVE-What IS HMPV-JAN8-2025-1736327184" data-recalc-dims="1"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3429031" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Al Jazeera)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what to know about the virus, which transmits like other respiratory diseases such as flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-hmpv"&gt;What is HMPV?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human metapneumovirus is a respiratory virus that causes flu or cold-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; peaks during late winter and spring, according to the United States-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First identified in 2001 in the Netherlands, the disease is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comments-about-hmpv-human-metapneumovirus-following-media-reports-about-cases-in-china/#:~:text=At%20the%20age%20of%20five,such%20as%20bronchitis%20and%20pneumonia." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;very common,&lt;/a&gt; infecting almost every child by the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMPV is tested by collecting a sample of mucus from the nose or throat using a swab. Similar to COVID, the sample is analysed in a lab, often with RT-PCR tests. Other methods, like antigen tests, can also identify the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-is-hmpv-transmitted"&gt;How is HMPV transmitted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMPV enters the body through the nose, mouth, or eyes, typically after inhaling droplets from an infected person coughing, sneezing, or breathing, or after touching contaminated surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modes of transmission are similar to those of the common cold, flu, and other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-hmpv-do-to-the-body"&gt;What does HMPV do to the body?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After entering the body, the virus attaches to the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, which includes airways and the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These epithelial cells form a protective barrier in the airways, helping to guard the respiratory system while clearing mucus, dust, and other debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the cells, the virus replicates, producing more viral particles. These newly formed viruses infect neighbouring cells, spreading through the respiratory epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body’s immune system detects the infection and launches an inflammatory response to combat the virus. While essential for clearing the virus, this reaction contributes to the symptoms of the infection, such as nasal congestion and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3426419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3426419" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3426419" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AFP__20250106__36T67WE__v1__HighRes__IndiaHealthVirusHmpv-1736186679.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="hmpv mural" data-recalc-dims="1"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3426419" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pedestrians walk past a wall mural promoting awareness on using face masks in Bengaluru on January 6, 2025, amid concerns and alleged media reports stating that two cases of HMPV were detected in India’s Karnataka state. [Idrees Mohammed/AFP]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="which-countries-have-seen-a-rise-in-hmpv-cases"&gt;Which countries have seen a rise in HMPV cases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In northern China, HMPV cases have been rising among children 14 years and younger, according to Kan Biao, director of China’s Institute for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike coincides with the cold winter months, during which respiratory infections are more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the rise in cases, China’s National Disease Control and Prevention Administration said it is piloting a monitoring system for pneumonia of unknown origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries like India and the United Kingdom have also reported seasonal increases in HMPV since late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has reported seven confirmed cases of HMPV across several states, including Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian government has advised states to boost surveillance for respiratory illnesses and advised the public not to panic and maintain standard precautions such as regularly washing hands and avoiding close contact with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2024-to-2025-season/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-report-5-december-week-49" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, between December 23 and 29 last year, some 4.5 percent of lab-tested samples were positive for HMPV, a slight increase from the previous week. In comparison, 29.5 percent were positive for influenza, and 2.5 percent for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise global data on the virus is scarce as surveillance and reporting of the virus is not as robust or routine as the flu or COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-it-contagious-or-deadly-who-is-more-at-risk"&gt;Is it contagious or deadly? Who is more at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMPV spreads easily, but it is not typically deadly in healthy individuals – a point highlighted by the WHO on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMPV is attracting a lot of interest because it is not a household name, but it was discovered in 2001, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMPV is “a common virus that circulates in winter and spring,” she said, adding that its case mortality rate is “very, very low”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have mild symptoms resembling the common cold or flu and recover fully within seven to 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate mortality rates have been difficult to measure owing to limited data and overlap with other respiratory illnesses. However, in low-resource settings where access to healthcare is limited, HMPV-linked deaths have been relatively more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, within some people, the virus can lead to more severe respiratory complications, such as bronchitis, inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs, or pneumonia, infection of the lung tissue. This includes high-risk groups such as infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants, for example, have smaller and more delicate airways, which can become easily inflamed or blocked during respiratory infections. Moreover, their immune systems and bodies are still developing, making it harder to fight the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ageing also reduces the immune function, while underlying health conditions make it harder to get rid of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="symptoms-of-hmpv-infection"&gt;What are the symptoms of HMPV infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These symptoms typically appear within three to six days after being infected, and often include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nasal congestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheezing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathlessness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable groups may experience more severe and prolonged symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-can-hmpv-infection-be-treated"&gt;How can HMPV infection be treated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no antiviral treatment or vaccine designed just for HMPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms, such as using fever medications, staying hydrated, and resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe cases, especially those involving pneumonia or significant respiratory distress, may require hospitalisation and supportive care like oxygen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera English</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:54:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNQ0gyODh1RTNVWUNHQW9QMDgzWmxQdDhoXzdQTzkxRXZQbUJGbEttRkgzSFA2ZnBZbTY3cVc1S2tYMTZOOXlJVnBnd0Z5TW51TGlBTlpnVkxETzB5bl8wZGZneURQMWxNS0VJSmxSazdjTlp2QngwUGxBM0ZkeXJxYTVlUVFVbjZwUHNjZXpBdWVaSkVpOGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTWhzQnNvT20tZDhETDdoTHFQQjFqRk5XODFZbk5jNVc4djl2ZTNHT2hySHJld0hPeXBOUDliOFFQeW52S3Bqdlg3M2hPanhLRFlfWmhqTk9NUnIxNFdnNWd6V2pkT2NpZXVBSkUzSGlGTE9sd3d0V0phWG41Q3VhRXo0MWpqREVmbXdtTHI0WW90aUhhcGFVSEI2dnc</guid></item><item><title>What is HMPV, are cases of human metapneumovirus surging in China, and should we be worried? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQT2pEa0JPOFAxc3EwektLSzJ5bDdnSUNmb1VRQjZWdlR6NnJSQUF4SW9SRmU0eUxTRnRzOHJkRWxZLVRsY0NZaE12ZUlFMUhFbW5hYmlaSkYtZkJod091eWh4R0NsVGFPNklxX2wtT1Aya19RS29sM08xbE9BVHA5QzFKdkEtdy1PRUZqb21yekRUYnBrOVpRUGVqUlRsYzVRRDlOSEhnQTVWSkdIRVdGR3N3bXFDMWdDR3Qtc1V0Ulc4WldzQ0RZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory disease that causes flu or cold-like symptoms, but can increase risks or lead to more serious complications like bronchitis or pneumonia, particularly among the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The disease is in the same family as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and has been around since at least 2001 when it was first identified in the Netherlands. Its outbreaks are concentrated during colder seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QAndAExplainerBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-hmpv-in-the-news" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Why is HMPV in the news?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cases have been surging in northern China, particularly among children, according to local authorities. The country’s centre for disease control (CDC) has &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202306/1291955.shtml" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warned people to take precautions&lt;/a&gt; with health and hygiene, but has also pushed back against online claims of overwhelmed hospitals and fears of another Covid-like pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Respiratory infections tend to peak during the winter season,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The diseases appear to be less severe and spread with a smaller scale compared to the previous year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The apparent increase in cases is likely partly due to new technology more easily detecting and identifying HMPV, experts told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also, “I think we’re just more cautious of outbreaks now”, said Dr Jacqueline Stephens, a senior lecturer in public health at Flinders University in Australia. “Everyone is hypervigilant, and you hear this term human metapneumovirus and it sounds kind of scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-serious-is-hmpv-and-what-are-the-symptoms" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How serious is HMPV and what are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The symptoms of HMPV are similar to a cold or flu, and it is one of several viruses often lumped under a broad definition of the “common cold”, said Stephens. It is not a notifiable disease like Covid-19 or influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s a range of others … that are not notifiable because they are very common and lots of people get them. They make us feel terrible for a few days but if we rest and recuperate for a few days then we get better,” said Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;HMPV can lead to more serious illnesses like bronchitis and pneumonia among elderly people, very young children, and people who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It certainly can and does cause severe disease, that’s why I think it’s important that people know it’s out there,” said said Prof Paul Griffin, director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The challenge is at the moment there’s not much we can do except educate people [that] it’s around to reduce transmission. There’s no vaccine or antivirals, although there are some vaccines in development,” said Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-worried-should-we-be-about-the-virus" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How worried should we be about the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;HMPV is not like Covid-19, in that it has been around for several decades and there is a level of immunity in the global population from past infections, the experts said. Covid-19 was a new disease which had never infected humans before, driving the pandemic-level spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t think we’re necessarily concerned about a pandemic with this virus, but the surge in cases and impact it’s having are significant,” said Griffin. “A good lesson can be taken [from the pandemic] to reduce the spread, particularly given we don’t have vaccines or antivirals for HMPV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-should-we-do-about-it" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What should we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“For a number of years [during Covid] we were good at precautions for reducing the numbers, now we are doing less, and we’re seeing a rebound,” said Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’m certainly not suggesting we go back to the harsh restrictions of Covid, but staying home, practising good cough and sneeze etiquette, and hand hygiene are so important during the winter season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Both experts also urged people not to go to work while sick, and Stephens suggested wearing a mask if you do have to go into the community, to prevent further infecting others, especially those at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 04:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQT2pEa0JPOFAxc3EwektLSzJ5bDdnSUNmb1VRQjZWdlR6NnJSQUF4SW9SRmU0eUxTRnRzOHJkRWxZLVRsY0NZaE12ZUlFMUhFbW5hYmlaSkYtZkJod091eWh4R0NsVGFPNklxX2wtT1Aya19RS29sM08xbE9BVHA5QzFKdkEtdy1PRUZqb21yekRUYnBrOVpRUGVqUlRsYzVRRDlOSEhnQTVWSkdIRVdGR3N3bXFDMWdDR3Qtc1V0Ulc4WldzQ0RZ</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu hits U.S. poultry, dairy: TWRA advises caution with food - WTVC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQdUUyQTJFWXBPSlRyMWtUd1A0andicUJmMGtPT0RwVnRfTXl6WDNISWp6UHVCVXBYNWxfTXhzTTYzbzNXVldYbXc2UU5Gc1Z5c01pZ01aWVhDd1RPMGxIbEN1dGhvbkRpb2pMR09tUlk3bmU4OW43TXdIQThWdVJ1bDlHTHA4dGJWYnZrSi05eTNQeXA3RjdMMnh4MThtQdIBowFBVV95cUxNbVNsQ0pNcFlTd0xZcWt3eXUyT3l4RGFMaTA1N2pjSkItUVZ2dE52d1NCek1YM25ZTzA2NUZ6MHAtejVaYk93VEVmaktxOVprZ2w3Wmt4SXA0VEstU20taExqakpFZl8tLXlyV0JzNzloaFlwaS1UZzRLNkdmcHJKTEVTUjRCUkZrSEFRVVlsQmpBZjhOR2NiVm05WnRXc1VRdzBR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — &lt;/span&gt;According to the CDC, there are now more than 60 confirmed cases of bird flu in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/louisiana-reports-first-severe-us-bird-flu-case-linked-to-backyard-flocks-cdc-confirms-california-missouri-center-for-disease-control-prevention-agency-health-officials-virus-infections" target="_blank" title="https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/louisiana-reports-first-severe-us-bird-flu-case-linked-to-backyard-flocks-cdc-confirms-california-missouri-center-for-disease-control-prevention-agency-health-officials-virus-infections" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The first severe illness in a human connected to bird flu was found in Louisiana last week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Although human infection through avian influenza is rare&lt;/a&gt;, the spread of the virus among multiple species could have an impact on what you eat on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest strain, H5, is a widespread issue and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with the CDC reporting several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the TWRA is warning homeowners and hunters to take precaution if they come in contact with an infected bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We're actually seeing mortality events in waterfowl also, whereas normally we only see it on the domestic poultry side of things. And then there's also been, over the last two years, some mammals across the united states... wild mammals that have actually been impacted that maybe scavenged a bird or ate a bird that was infected."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who are the people that should be cautious about potential bird flu infections? TWRA tells us...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hunters or any individuals that might be coming in contact with birds, whether that's if they work at a poultry facility, or have backyard birds at their homes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says human infections with avian influenza viruses can happen when virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Fedderson with TWRA emphasizes the importance of making sure to protect yourself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"If they handle any birds, whether they're alive or they're dead, they should wear gloves. If they're going to be in close contact with any live birds, they should probably wear some kind of mask, because they're shedding their their virus in their feces."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for contamination in the food you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWRA urges caution, however...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the poultry industry, one of the things that actually happens is if they diagnose it in a flock of birds, those birds don't ever make it to market. Those birds are actually dealt with on farm, and they're humanely dealt with and put down on the farm."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke to Mike Hayes, the owner of Farm to Fork. They use local products at their restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes told us about the safety measures he takes while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We make sure that they're cleaned properly, so we don't cross contaminate between meats and poultry. Once we decide we're actually cooking these products with chicken, you make sure that you cook it up to, if not exceeding, 165 degrees."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes adds that it's not only their judgement that counts...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The chickens, eggs, and other things coming in our building, the FDA is going through a very, very lengthy and arduous task of making sure that these birds are kept up to standard."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say you can report dead or sick birds or animals to &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/" target="_blank" title="https://www.usda.gov/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WTVC</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 01:13:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQdUUyQTJFWXBPSlRyMWtUd1A0andicUJmMGtPT0RwVnRfTXl6WDNISWp6UHVCVXBYNWxfTXhzTTYzbzNXVldYbXc2UU5Gc1Z5c01pZ01aWVhDd1RPMGxIbEN1dGhvbkRpb2pMR09tUlk3bmU4OW43TXdIQThWdVJ1bDlHTHA4dGJWYnZrSi05eTNQeXA3RjdMMnh4MThtQdIBowFBVV95cUxNbVNsQ0pNcFlTd0xZcWt3eXUyT3l4RGFMaTA1N2pjSkItUVZ2dE52d1NCek1YM25ZTzA2NUZ6MHAtejVaYk93VEVmaktxOVprZ2w3Wmt4SXA0VEstU20taExqakpFZl8tLXlyV0JzNzloaFlwaS1UZzRLNkdmcHJKTEVTUjRCUkZrSEFRVVlsQmpBZjhOR2NiVm05WnRXc1VRdzBR</guid></item><item><title>There Is No Safe Level of Alcohol Consumption, US Surgeon General Warns - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOUFdsaDdrRHBQU3Jfa3pVaUR4S2pDV21xTDl0TjYzbExOX0Y3UXhUaEUxNUoxNnZrUVY1aHU2QV9DbFo1TmV2QmNHQVphSVNVUWtBb3lBSFFUbWFSTXh6MWc0dmpfVGotMVdJdjFBLXREWTM4ano4SktLcC1pOGx3OTdNMEUtcldoeldaeU9JUVJkS1NWOWNlV1d1SUExU3Ni?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An advisory issued by the US Surgeon General declares that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report based on a review of the available scientific literature, alcohol is implicated in the risk of a range of cancers, particularly breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="148367" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in women, followed by &lt;span&gt;cancers that affect the digestive system&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, alcohol alone is responsible for nearly 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths per year in the US, the review finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This body of scientific evidence demonstrates a causal relationship between alcohol use and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, including breast (in women), colorectum, esophagus, liver, mouth (oral cavity), throat (pharynx), and voice box (larynx)," &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;the advisory states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The more alcohol consumed, the greater the risk of cancer. For certain cancers, like breast, mouth, and throat cancers, evidence shows that this risk may start to increase around one or fewer drinks per day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148372" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-cancer.jpg" alt="There Is No Safe Consumption of Alcohol: US Surgeon General" class="size-full wp-image-148372" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-cancer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-cancer-332x415.jpg 332w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-cancer-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148372" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;Office of the US Surgeon General&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health advice on alcohol consumption can be somewhat mixed, with evidence suggesting that drinking in moderation &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation/alcohol-full-story/"&gt;may actually be beneficial to some aspects of one's health&lt;/a&gt; contrasting with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/global-burden-of-disease-alcohol-assessment-global-death-disability-rate"&gt;studies that highlight harm to others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link between alcohol and cancer is known and established, but is usually correlated with heavy drinking, with the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info"&gt;US Dietary Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; setting "healthy" limits of one to two drinks per day for men, and one or less for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even that, the new advisory says, is too much. An estimated 17 percent of the 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths per year fall within the recommended consumption limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In 2019, an estimated 96,730 cancer cases were related to alcohol consumption including 42,400 in men and 54,330 in women," &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;the advisory states&lt;/a&gt;. "Globally, 741,300 cancer cases were related to alcohol consumption in 2020; 185,100 of those cases were related to consumption of approximately two drinks daily or fewer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are predominantly four mechanisms whereby alcohol can increase cancer risk; through an increase in oxidative stress that damages DNA and proteins; by altering hormone levels, significantly increasing breast cancer risk; by increasing the rate at which your body absorbs carcinogens; and by breaking down into a toxic compound called acetaldehyde, which also damages DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148374" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-risk.jpg" alt="There Is No Safe Consumption of Alcohol: US Surgeon General" class="size-full wp-image-148374" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-risk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-risk-332x415.jpg 332w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/alcohol-risk-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148374" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A graph of the cumulative risk of alcohol-related cancer by the age of 80.

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the advisory is to raise awareness of the link between cancer and alcohol consumption, since nearly half of all adult Americans are unaware a connection even exists. In fact, alcohol is considered a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IARC_group_1"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="148367" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Other members of that group include formaldehyde, ionizing radiation, tobacco, processed meat, and asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Dietary Guidelines are due to be updated this year. The Surgeon General's office also recommends updating the warning labels on alcohol to include a warning about cancer risk, as well as improved education efforts across the board, so that individuals are able to make choices informed by the most up-to-date scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read through the full Surgeon General's Advisory and access its cited sources &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;on the Office of the Surgeon General's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drink coffee in the morning have a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and a lower overall mortality risk compared to all-day coffee drinkers, according to research &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Feurheartj%2Fehae871" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Lu Qi, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and Professor at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University, New Orleans, U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, "Research so far suggests that drinking &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coffee/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; doesn't raise the risk of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to lower the risk of some chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Given the effects that caffeine has on our bodies, we wanted to see if the time of day when you drink coffee has any impact on heart health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included 40,725 adults taking part in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this study, participants were asked about all the food and drink they consumed on at least one day, including whether they drank coffee, how much and when. It also included a sub-group of 1,463 people who were asked to complete a detailed food and drink diary for a full week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to link this information with records of deaths and cause of death over a period of nine to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 36% of people in the study were morning coffee drinkers (they primarily drank coffee before midday), 16% of people drank coffee throughout the day (morning, afternoon and evening) and 48% were not coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Compared with people who did not drink coffee, morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no reduction in risk for all-day coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning coffee drinkers benefited from the lower risks whether they were moderate drinkers (two to three cups) or heavy drinkers (more than three cups). Light morning drinkers (one cup or less) benefited from a smaller decrease in risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Qi said, "This is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes. Our findings indicate that it's not just whether you drink coffee or how much you drink, but the time of day when you drink coffee that's important. We don't typically give advice about timing in our dietary guidance, but perhaps we should be thinking about this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study doesn't tell us why drinking coffee in the morning reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. A possible explanation is that consuming coffee in the afternoon or evening may disrupt &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/circadian+rhythms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt; and levels of hormones such as melatonin. This, in turn, leads to changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further studies are needed to validate our findings in other populations, and we need &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to test the potential impact of changing the time of day when people drink coffee."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial Professor Thomas F. Lüscher from Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, London, UK, said, "In their study published in &lt;i&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/i&gt;, Wang [and colleagues] analyzed the time of the day when coffee is consumed in 40,725 adults from the NHANES and of 1463 adults from the Women's and Men's Lifestyle Validation Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"During a median follow-up of almost a decade, and after adjustment for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake, the amounts of cups per day, sleep hours, and other confounders, the morning-type, rather than the all-day-type pattern, was significantly associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 0.84 and of cardiovascular mortality of even 0.69 as compared with non-coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why would time of the day matter? In the morning hours there is commonly a marked increase in sympathetic activity as we wake up and get out of bed, an effect that fades away during the day and reaches its lowest level during sleep. Thus, it is possible, as the authors point out, that coffee drinking in the afternoon or evening disrupts the circadian rhythm of sympathetic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Indeed, many all-day drinkers suffer from sleep disturbances. In this context, it is of interest that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, an important sleep-inducing mediator in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/morning+hours/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;morning hours&lt;/a&gt;, is likely to be healthy. Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning."&lt;/p&gt;

            Drinking coffee has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/health/coffee-live-longer-wellness/index.html"&gt;repeatedly been linked&lt;/a&gt; with better heart health and prolonged life. But the benefits of coffee consumption could depend on when&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you drink it, new research has found.

            Limiting coffee intake to the morning, it turns out, may be best — and that seems to be regardless of the amount consumed and other potentially influential factors, according to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae871" target="_blank"&gt;a study published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the European Heart Journal.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000i3b6mh4r2wzd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most past research investigating participants’ coffee intake over time have found moderate levels of coffee consumption may be associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and premature death, according to the latest study. But scientific evidence of whether factors such as genetics, amount consumed or added sweeteners affect these relationships has been inconsistent or, at times, controversial, the authors said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000j3b6mb4jf6tw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors studied the dietary and health data of 40,725 adults age 18 and older from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted from 1999 to 2018. During 10 cycles over the years, those participants provided details of their dietary intake from the previous day. The authors also included a subgroup of 1,463 adults, from both the women’s and men’s versions of the Lifestyle Validation Study, who had completed at least one weeklong dietary record.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000k3b6msn1g29k1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were included, and timing was categorized in three periods: morning (from 4 a.m. to 11:59 a.m.), afternoon (from 12 p.m. to 4:59 p.m.) and evening (from 5 p.m. to 3:59 a.m.).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000l3b6m6vfv83pa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers identified two patterns of timing of consumption: morning and all day. By the end of the median follow-up period of nearly 10 years, there were 4,295 deaths from all causes, 1,268 from cardiovascular disease and 934 from cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000m3b6mx2qy8nli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with people who weren’t coffee drinkers, having coffee only in the morning was associated with a 16% lower risk of premature death from any cause and a 31% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Those who tended to drink coffee all day didn’t have a reduction in risk. These findings remained even after the authors took into account confounders such as sleep hours, age, race, ethnicity, sex, family income, education, physical activity levels, a dietary score, and health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000n3b6mk21u6ehg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For morning coffee drinkers, the amount of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee consumed didn’t matter, either — whether they drank less than one or more than three cups of coffee daily.  Having done so in the morning was still better than other patterns in terms of mortality risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000o3b6mzdm8a9xm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The study was observational, meaning that it wasn’t an experiment setting, (which) is the gold standard,” said Vanessa King, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who wasn’t involved in the study, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000p3b6m7c2t0cru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The nature of the study also means it only establishes an association, not a causal relationship between morning coffee drinking and early death risk. But the findings are “meaningful as the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in America is cardiovascular diseases,” King added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000q3b6mzq9czzcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. David Kao, who wasn’t involved in the research, found the study to be “fascinating” and one of the best investigations on this topic in years, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000r3b6mrolks1i2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Highlights include using a machine learning-style method to categorize coffee drinking patterns, and validation of findings in (more than one) external data source which are distinct from the primary source, which greatly reduces the likelihood of an accidental/false positive finding,” Kao, the Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women’s Heart Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz, said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000s3b6m1jqxpe16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the study has a few other shortcomings: For one, recollections of dietary intake are subject to inaccuracies or biases, and they don’t account for long-term habits, the authors said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000t3b6mirh9bhlm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Secondly, even though the authors considered multiple confounders, it’s possible there were others that couldn’t be completely ruled out, they said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000u3b6mbd2yt1eq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team “could not exclude the possibility that the morning-type coffee drinking pattern is a marker for an overall healthy lifestyle,” according to the study. “For example, morning-type coffee drinkers may be more willing to exercise and eat non-&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/ultraprocessed-foods-type-2-diabetes/index.html"&gt;ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000v3b6mqidwuszf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, genetic information wasn’t available, so the authors were unable to examine any possible effect of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/health/genes-food-diet-habits-wellness/index.html"&gt;genetically determined caffeine&lt;/a&gt; metabolism rates.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000w3b6mrk1ufwnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A possible explanation for the findings “is that consuming coffee in the afternoon or evening may disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin,” Qi said. Low levels of melatonin have been linked with higher levels of blood pressure and oxidative stress, and greater cardiovascular disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000x3b6m2m08q0i2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coffee also contains antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body by neutralizing free radicals that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, King said. Free radicals, unstable molecules from environmental sources such as cigarette smoke or pesticides, can harm cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000y3b6m2dcqe3ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some inflammatory markers in the blood have their own clocks, the authors said, and they are typically highest in the morning — so “the anti-inflammatory effect of a pattern of coffee consumption concentrated in the morning may be more beneficial than that of a pattern … spread across morning, afternoon and evening.” That applies to both caffeinated and decaf coffee consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep000z3b6m69sverfl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you want to start restricting your coffee intake to the morning but are having trouble, consider whether you’re regularly getting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness/index.html"&gt;enough quality rest&lt;/a&gt;, King said. Seeing a sleep specialist to find out whether you have a condition, such as sleep apnea, disturbing your rest could also be useful, Kao said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep00103b6moo9c3rd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can also begin with diluting your daytime servings and accompanying them with water for hydration, King said — which can also help you feel more awake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep00113b6mtc7xoujw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Getting your thyroid, vitamin D and iron levels tested can help you determine whether exhaustion is stemming from something more serious, said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep00133b6msqgdta24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you don’t drink coffee and think you could gain from adding it to your routine, first “look at the bigger picture,” said Anderson-Haynes, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Are you living an overall physically active, balanced, sustainable and healthy diet and lifestyle?”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5n4hmep00143b6m5qh0a6t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until more evidence is provided about when to drink coffee, she added, follow your doctor or dietitian’s recommendation on caffeine intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This, in turn, can lead to changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Thomas Lüscher, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals in London, said: ‘Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the morning hours, is likely to be healthy. Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many people with diabetes and insulin-related health issues struggle to find accessible and affordable care, making these products a potential game changer in the healthcare sphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ces-2025-zdnet-best-products-2025-01-06/"&gt;CES 2025: The most impressive products so far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People without diabetes also use glucose monitoring to help make adjustments to their eating habits and improve overall health. So, the Lingo by Abbott and the Stelo by Dexcom could benefit a wide variety of users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Dexcom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stelo by Dexcom tracks glucose levels 24/7    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This CGM is designed for general wellness tracking but Dexcom emphasizes it was also designed to empower those with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin and prediabetics who are 18 years or older. The sensor, a "small, flexible wire," is inserted under your skin by an applicator and tracks glucose levels 24/7. Each sensor lasts up to 30 days and is connected to an app on your iPhone or Android that delivers your readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ces-2025-products-you-can-buy-right-now/"&gt;The best CES 2025 products you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the company sold similar devices, but they were much more expensive and sometimes involved insurance for them to be accessible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us/buy-stelo-one-time" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stelo Glucose Biosensor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at $90 a month or for a one-time purchase of $100. Use of its app requires a minimum of iOS 16.2 or Android 12. Stelo also offers FSA or HSA reimbursements, but check for eligibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Abbott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lingo monitors for general wellness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott's Lingo is very similar to the Stelo, however the Lingo has a wear span of 14 days. This device also requires users to be 18 or older and to not be on insulin. It uses your glucose data to make personalized suggestions helping you get a better grip on your lifestyle. It offers coaching, a companion app, and personal insights on eating habits, stressors, and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This device is also inserted into your arm using a thin, flexible filament via an applicator, but the website says that most people find the process painless. Lingo's app is iOS only, so the service is only offered to iPhone users for now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-wore-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-for-a-month-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;I wore a continuous glucose monitor for a month.

            As China experiences a rise in respiratory infections this winter, one little-known virus has gotten a lot of attention – and some people may worry whether the rise in cases could be felt more broadly around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j00063b6mjr0yaecl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Human metapneumovirus, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;HMPV&lt;/a&gt;, can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, and &lt;a href="https://www.chinacdc.cn/jksj/jksj04_14275/202501/t20250102_303654.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; released last week shows that the country has seen more cases in recent weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j00073b6m21eyjb5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON550" target="_blank"&gt;HMPV typically circulates in the Northern Hemisphere in winter&lt;/a&gt;, and China’s CDC data shows that there have also been rises in a number of other common respiratory infections, including the seasonal flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j00083b6mue6d4aw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the normal range. It’s what we would expect to see for the winter season,” Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.unognewsroom.org/story/en/2470%20/un-geneva-press-briefing-07-january-2025/0/WjnegYbwZ1" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news briefing&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j00093b6mm00lhmy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To calm concerns, she added that hospital utilization in China is lower than at this time last year and that there have been no emergency declarations or emergency responses launched in the country in connection with these respiratory infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000a3b6m24k83whv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Regarding human metapneumovirus, it’s not a new virus,” Harris said. “It was first identified in 2001. It’s been in the human population for a long time. It is a common virus that circulates in winter and spring.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000b3b6mg8utvmuj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, the CDC tracks cases of HMPV in the same way it tracks the spread of other respiratory viruses. It’s estimated that about &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22443-human-metapneumovirus-hmpv" target="_blank"&gt;10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children&lt;/a&gt; are caused by HMPV; most people &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22443-human-metapneumovirus-hmpv" target="_blank"&gt;will get HMPV at some point before age 5&lt;/a&gt;, and then reinfections can occur throughout life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5myuu2u00063b6m8j995x6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data shows that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HMPV cases started to show up more frequently in November and have been rising since&lt;/a&gt;. But, compared with other common viruses, the weekly percent of respiratory infections testing positive for HMPV has been low, at 1.94% as of December 28. In comparison, flu was at 18.71% and Covid-19 at 7.10% that week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000c3b6mx2ijolcb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s respiratory virus season for a reason. We’ve gotten very accustomed to thinking about those that have been really severe – so Covid, as well as flu and RSV – but there are a host of other respiratory viruses out there that you can get sick with,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv0k3e00003b6mwutsc0b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to common respiratory infections like HMPV, “many times, you get better on your own, but not necessarily always,” Hamilton said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000d3b6mz23jqjcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Typically, infections are relatively mild, and we often think about it like the common cold,” she added. “Many people don’t necessarily know when they have a common cold that it is caused by human metapneumovirus, but it’s definitely one of the viruses that are often associated with the common cold.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5myermg00003b6mv3kmh93f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html#:~:text=Symptoms%20commonly%20associated%20with%20HMPV,upper%20and%20lower%20respiratory%20infections." target="_blank"&gt;symptoms commonly associated with HMPV&lt;/a&gt; infections include cough, fever, stuffy nose and shortness of breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000f3b6ms71womo3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HMPV spreads from person to person in a similar way as some other respiratory viruses: through droplets from coughing or sneezing and through touch, such as shaking hands or touching contaminated surfaces.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000g3b6mrlu55onj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Simple measures can prevent spread. And these include, if you’re sick, if you’ve got symptoms, stay home,” Harris said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv7iix001b3b6m4317hg49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Also, if you’re in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, when you know that there’s a virus currently circulating, think about wearing a mask. Improve ventilation where you can,” she said. “And of course, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000i3b6ms7o1qmr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people are at increased risk of severe infections with HMPV, Harris said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000j3b6mc5q44io6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In some cases, like any of the common cold viruses, it can lead to more severe disease in people who’ve got no immunity or have got very weak immune systems,” she said. “That’s the very young. That’s newborn babies – that’s why you don’t go and visit a newborn baby and kiss it when you’ve got a cold – and the very old. Again, that’s why you should not go and visit your over-90 great-grandmother in hospital when you’ve got a cold.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000l3b6mq4brpidi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health care providers can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;test for HMPV&lt;/a&gt;, but there is no vaccine, and there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat infections. Resting at home and staying hydrated can help with symptoms, as well as some over-the-counter medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Mild cases of HMPV usually last a few days to a week, and many people recover by themselves within two to five days.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5mv1b5j000n3b6mv7c2pw6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It will present in the same way as flu, sars-cov-2, RSV, so the same advice applies for those affected – rest, take on fluids, try not to spread it to others,” John Tregoning, a professor in vaccine immunology at Imperial College London, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comments-about-hmpv-human-metapneumovirus-following-media-reports-about-cases-in-china/" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; distributed Monday by the UK-based Science Media Centre.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If you do feel very unwell go to your GP,” he said. “As it is a virus, antibiotics won’t have any effect.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

She was discharged home without treatment and later developed a cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. She wound up back in the emergency department in respiratory distress a few days later. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and went into respiratory failure but eventually recovered after treatment. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the girl had a history of mild asthma and an elevated body-mass index. It’s unknown how she caught the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What that tells us is that we have no idea who is going to develop mild illness and who is going to develop severe illness, and because of that we have to take these infections very seriously,” Nuzzo says. “We should not assume that all future infections will be mild.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There’s another clue that could explain the severity of the Louisiana and British Columbia cases. Virus samples from both patients showed some similarities. For one, both were infected with the same subtype of H5N1 called D1.1, which is the same kind of virus found in wild birds and poultry. It’s different from the B3.13 subtype, which is dominant in dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Right now, the question is, is this a more severe strain than the dairy cattle strain?” says Benjamin Anderson, assistant professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. So far, scientists don’t have enough data to know for sure. A handful of poultry farm workers in Washington have tested positive for the D1.1 subtype, but those individuals had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“In the case of the Louisiana infection, we know that person had comorbidities. We know that person was an older individual. These are factors that contribute to more severe outcomes already when it comes to respiratory infections,” Anderson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the Louisiana and British Columbia cases, there’s evidence that the virus may have evolved in both patients to produce more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-12232024.html"&gt;CDC report from late December&lt;/a&gt; found genetic mutations in the virus taken from the Louisiana patient that may have allowed it to enhance its ability to infect the upper airways of humans. The report says the changes observed were likely generated by replication of the virus throughout the patient’s illness rather than transmitted at the time of infection, meaning that the mutations weren’t present in the birds the person was exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the team that cared for the Canadian teen also described “worrisome” mutations found in her viral samples. These changes could have allowed the virus to more easily bind to and enter cells in the human respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the past, bird flu has rarely been transmitted from person to person, but scientists worry about a scenario where the virus would acquire mutations that would make human transmission more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For now, people who work with birds, poultry, or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk of getting bird flu. To prevent illness, health officials recommend avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 22:07:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNWHAyZ2tFZ3FjM0d4cG5tR0lBQ0hFV0RUTGpxOVR2c05fbVg4TG5MN2JiaWwxRGlVMDRvWW91Zk92XzZvLUNRWElvMUlrWFdaQU1PUnRSRDRlM3lqMlZiY1JJNVQxMVc5ZlExS283OUhIeGU0V3hvdDlLUGFTc3VmUg</guid></item><item><title>Seasonal illnesses swamp Capital Region hospitals - Times Union</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPcWExb1VLekZHZ0lOcUV6WnhaM19mdklWVkFuRWpteTdBTXowZV9rQ2YxMlZXT2hMS0FEaEVrRmNBeFZDUW1rcFRJZmZMTmktZVl3SFlkeHRhT3lVd0lTbGJLWnVLZnh6eExSdUpta3Z3aEwxelo3Qll4RTBPOUs5ZGtpTGltTFlXUUVyU2FDRmw0R3BpYzBnX0RhNXNDSXhXc0pETQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The state reported 2,080 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in 2024 in preliminary data released last week by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. That represents a jump of roughly 66 percent from the previous year, when the state reported 1,252 cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cases over the winter have so far outpaced the previous year, with 134 cases reported in November and 279 reported in December. In 2023, there were 52 cases reported in November and 112 in December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Public health officials say they have been monitoring the increase in cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationally, cases of the virus are surging in parts of the United States this winter, according to government data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show there were 91 outbreaks of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data-table.html"&gt;norovirus reported&lt;/a&gt; during the week of Dec. 5, up from 69 outbreaks the last week of November.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/noroviruses-norwalk-like-viruses" target="_blank"&gt;according to state health officials&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being one of the most common causes of foodborne illness, the virus is difficult to detect in a laboratory, and specialized norovirus tests are usually conducted only in certain circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A spokesperson for the DPH said the uptick in cases may be attributed in part to more modern testing methods which can detect multiple pathogens at once. They also noted that certain test devices were recently found to be prone to false positives of norovirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people, and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea, and alcohol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health officials also recommend that those sick with norovirus symptoms stay home and practice good hand hygiene to help reduce spread. Officials said washing with soap and water is preferable to hand sanitizer alone, which does not work well against norovirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;People infected with the virus should not prepare or handle food for others for at least three days after symptoms go away, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing.

You slap it on your arm and a small filament slides directly under your skin to convey data on your blood glucose levels to the sensor, connecting to your phone via Bluetooth so you can easily monitor them. If you’re diabetic, keeping your blood sugar levels stable means avoiding long-term health problems down the road. If you’re not, it means you can maximize your athletic performance … or just prevent that 3 pm brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Lingo has been out for several months, but I have been delaying testing it. Besides the major squick factor, I’m not sure what I’d do with the data. I know I would benefit from eating more fiber, more whole grains, and lean proteins. It's just … well, I’m a working mom of two, and I don’t have a personal chef making me chicken breasts at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;I’ve measured my body fat composition with electric currents and taken pictures of my unclothed self for AI analysis before now. But the latest round of health monitoring tests go much deeper, and at &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/live/ces-2025-liveblog-1/"&gt;CES 2025&lt;/a&gt;, I've been able to take a closer look at a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Spit Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE fJvQtP caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd kVUvEC iXWezO caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivoo has launched a suite of women's health tests this year.&lt;/p&gt;

Technically, the first to launch was the Stelo last year, from diabetes equipment manufacturer Dexcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Dexcom also has an Apple Watch app and recently announced a new partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/oura-ring-4/"&gt;smart ring manufacturer Oura&lt;/a&gt;, which would add blood sugar monitoring to the list of already extensive biometrics that you can check on the Oura app. (It’s worth noting here that Dexcom also invested $75 million in Oura’s Series D funding.)

Using a brain tissue model, scientists observed that head trauma caused latent HSV-1 to awaken, leading to hallmark Alzheimer’s markers such as amyloid plaques, inflammation, and neuronal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated blows intensified these effects, while tissues without the virus showed limited damage. These findings open the door to exploring antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory agents as early interventions for reducing the long-term risks of neurodegeneration after head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dormant Viruses Reactivated:&lt;/strong&gt; Head trauma can awaken latent viruses like HSV-1, linked to Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodegeneration Markers:&lt;/strong&gt; Infected brain models showed amyloid plaques, inflammation, and neuronal death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments could prevent virus reactivation post-injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concussions and repetitive head trauma in sports like football and boxing, once accepted as an unpleasant consequence of intense athletic competition, are now recognized as serious health threats. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular concern is the connection between head injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, prompting sports governing bodies to adjust protective equipment and rules of play to minimize the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107390"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and viruses." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/tbi-virus-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of disability and death in adults, affecting about 69 million people worldwide each year, at an economic cost estimated at $400 billion annually. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tufts University and Oxford University have now uncovered mechanisms that may connect the dots between trauma event and the emergence of disease, pointing to latent viruses lurking in most of our brains that may be activated by the jolt, leading to inflammation and accumulating damage that can occur over the ensuing months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest the use of antiviral drugs as potential early preventive treatments post-head injury. The findings are published in a study in &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiome—which includes many hundreds of bacterial species that inhabit our bodies—provides aid in digestion, immune system development, and protection against harmful pathogens. But the microbiome also includes dozens of viruses that swarm within our bodies at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these can be potentially harmful, but simply lie dormant within our cells. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), found in over 80% of people, and varicella-zoster virus, found in 95% of people, are known to make their way into the brain and sleep within our neurons and glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Cairns, research associate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University and lead author of the study, had found evidence in earlier studies suggesting that activation of HSV-1 from its dormant state triggers the signature symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease in lab models of brain tissue—amyloid plaques, neuronal loss, inflammations, and diminished neural network functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In that study, another virus—varicella—created the inflammatory conditions that activated HSV-1,” said Cairns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought, what would happen if we subjected the brain tissue model to a physical disruption, something akin to a concussion? Would HSV-1 wake up and start the process of neurodegeneration?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s disease was first suggested by co-author Ruth Itzhaki, Visiting Professorial Fellow at Oxford University, who over 30 years ago identified the virus in a high proportion of brains from the elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her subsequent studies suggested that the virus can be reactivated in the brain from a latent state by events such as stress or immunosuppression, ultimately leading to neuronal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers used a lab model that reconstructs the environment of the brain to better understand how concussions may set off the first stages of virus reactivation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain tissue model consists of a 6mm wide donut-shaped sponge-like material made of silk protein and collagen, suffused with neural stem cells, which are then coaxed into mature neurons, growing axons and dendrite extensions and forming a network. Glial cells also emerge from the stem cells to help mimic the brain environment and nurture the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurons communicate with each other through their extensions similarly to how they would communicate in a brain. And just like cells in the brain, they can carry within them the DNA of dormant HSV-1 virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After enclosing the brain-like tissue in a cylinder and giving it a sudden jolt atop a piston, mimicking a concussion, Cairns examined the tissue under the microscope over time. Some of the tissue models had neurons with HSV-1, and some were virus-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the controlled blows, she observed that the infected cells showed re-activation of the virus, and shortly after that the signature markers of Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid plaques, p-tau (a protein that creates fiber-like “tangles” in the brain), inflammation, dying neurons, and a proliferation of glial cells called gliosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikes with the pistons on the tissue models mimicking repetitive head injuries led to the same reactions, which were even more severe. Meanwhile, the cells without HSV-1 showed some gliosis, but none of the other markers of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were a strong indicator that athletes suffering concussions could be triggering reactivation of latent infections in the brain that can lead to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies have shown that multiple blows to the head can lead to doubling or even greater chances of having a neurodegenerative condition months or years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the question as to whether antiviral drugs or anti-inflammatory agents might be useful as early preventive treatments after head trauma to stop HSV-1 activation in its tracks, and lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Cairns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem goes far beyond the concerns for athletes. Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of disability and death in adults, affecting about 69 million people worldwide each year, at an economic cost estimated at $400 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain tissue model takes us to another level in investigating these connections between injury, infection, and Alzheimer’s disease,” said David Kaplan, Stern Family Endowed Professor of Engineering at Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can re-create normal tissue environments that look like the inside of a brain, track viruses, plaques, proteins, genetic activity, inflammation and even measure the level of signaling between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of epidemiological evidence about environmental and other links to the risk of Alzheimer’s. The tissue model will help us put that information on a mechanistic footing and provide a starting point for testing new drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this TBI and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#402d292b256e33292c3625320034352634336e252435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Repetitive injury causes Alzheimer’s disease-like phenotypes via reactivation of HSV-1 in a 3D human brain tissue model&lt;/a&gt;” by Dana Cairns et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitive injury causes Alzheimer’s disease-like phenotypes via reactivation of HSV-1 in a 3D human brain tissue model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the brains of &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; carriers increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously found that latent HSV-1 in a three-dimensional in vitro model of &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt;-heterozygous human brain tissue was reactivated in response to neuroinflammation caused by exposure to other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because traumatic brain injury also causes neuroinflammation, we surmised that brain injury might similarly reactivate latent HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examined the effects of one or more controlled blows to our human brain model in the absence or presence of latent HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After repeated, mild controlled blows, latently infected tissues showed reactivation of HSV-1; the production and accumulation of β amyloid and phosphorylated tau (which promotes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration); and activated gliosis, which is associated with destructive neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are collectively associated with AD, dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and were increased with additional injury but were absent in mock-infected tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the cytokine IL-1β prevented the induction of amyloid and gliosis in latently infected monolayer cultures after scratch wounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We thus propose that after repeated mechanical injuries to the brain, such as from direct blows to the head or jarring motions of the head, the resulting reactivation of HSV-1 in the brain may contribute to the development of AD and related diseases in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 20:40:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE0tdGJmYnU0M2dUNHUydE4tLXFlQ1NNZkFRY0NkeVNjVFlQVnNOeGZEYkFSbnY0N2VmLWtkQWJNNWxfTlN4ek5JVWcya1JESEloRlJMalNXOVJqQThuemY2dTJpcGZmbXVkVXJpejZaejlUbkE</guid></item><item><title>China’s winter surge of flu-like HMPV cases puts nations on edge - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQRE1wZW80SEQwWTRFUm1PM3lIMnVQWVhCc1ltbHV3YnEyWEowQXdyRmw2cDRQZDJ6WUlPRzFWRW1hb2ZHem9EQU12emdkNjI1elEtNTVYQVE2dE1tcnhaNHgwYlhFM1NhanFMQWpwRkVxRVFpLW9ZaTU4ZkJyOTFfT21WanR2LVctd0thLTJHamg1SlJZT3E3RS1PRXFkMEhxbWlpWWxqRURXaEVOcFNwYXlKQ2Z3VC13SVRZQllWRFdkcjJjSzRUSXBveHJqdkZoZHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s winter illness season is less severe compared to the year before, according to data from its health authority. But the proliferation of a long-standing though little-known pathogen called human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been raising alarm both at home and in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of hMPV are on a steady rise and the pathogen has been identified as a main cause of respiratory illness and hospitalizations this winter, said the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. While not a new virus, hMPV appears to also be vexing governments across the region, with India, Malaysia and Hong Kong reporting cases in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do You Think HMPV Cases Will Increase Globally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia and Vietnam said they are closely monitoring the HMPV situation in China, asking the public not to panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new attention on HMPV — just one among a host of germs that causes the common cold — is likely due to improved virus detection capabilities in China and other countries after the Covid pandemic, during which governments spent millions on testing infrastructure and companies raced to develop better virus detection kits. And five years after SARS-CoV-2 sent the world into lockdown, outbreaks of illness in China attract outsized attention and are often the subject of misleading social media posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, pneumonia cases in Chinese children prompted the World Health Organization to ask Beijing to share information about respiratory pathogens in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV, first discovered in the Netherlands in 2001, has become far easier to detect and is among a suite of respiratory pathogens that common-used testing kits now screen for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab testing for pathogens including hMPV used to take a long time, with results often confirmed long after a patient already recovered. “Testing these days can identify the virus causing infections within half an hour so patients will quickly find out and that’ll trigger more learning and attention,” Hu Yang, a physician at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, told the National Business Daily last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although HMPV can make people very sick, the current situation is “very different” to the Covid-19 pandemic which was completely new to humans, said Professor Jill Carr, a virologist at Flinders’ University’s College of Medicine and Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its symptoms are mild in most cases, include coughing, fever, running nose and sore throat. There is no vaccine for the virus and it can cause pneumonia or even lead to hospitalization in high-risk groups such as children, elderly with chronic diseases, and patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China will continue to see multiple pathogens fueling its winter illness outbreak through spring, the country’s CDC said last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 20:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQRE1wZW80SEQwWTRFUm1PM3lIMnVQWVhCc1ltbHV3YnEyWEowQXdyRmw2cDRQZDJ6WUlPRzFWRW1hb2ZHem9EQU12emdkNjI1elEtNTVYQVE2dE1tcnhaNHgwYlhFM1NhanFMQWpwRkVxRVFpLW9ZaTU4ZkJyOTFfT21WanR2LVctd0thLTJHamg1SlJZT3E3RS1PRXFkMEhxbWlpWWxqRURXaEVOcFNwYXlKQ2Z3VC13SVRZQllWRFdkcjJjSzRUSXBveHJqdkZoZHc</guid></item><item><title>Should Britain be worried about the virus spreading in China? - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9XZE5XV09rWmdaTWxpbldrMUEyd0UyWklyUUM1Tkg0d0k0VE1MWUtjV3V1d1BMdFY4ZHVEZ1RpVW5MRk5DSmxmTnVjMXBnUU9KcjNOd1ZmZXVCc19IRTR0YWZTYkRxYVZxZnh1S2JkQk9jdnhzRUdWMQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;“I think the general public is becoming more aware of viruses,” says Dr Andrew Catchpole, chief scientific officer at hVIVO, a research organisation that tests infectious and respiratory disease vaccines and therapeutics. “They’re a lot more spoken about since the [Covid] pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unfamiliarity of the name hMPV may also add to a sense of fear, he suggests. We mostly don’t fear that old foe, the flu, in quite the same way as something with a name we haven’t heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, memories of how &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/03/02/scientists-china-covid-origins-transparency-lacking/"&gt;Chinese authorities&lt;/a&gt; responded to the Covid-19 pandemic after cases were first detected in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/28/covid-pandemic-may-started-by-scientists-un-professor/"&gt;Wuhan &lt;/a&gt;remain fresh. The country was widely criticised for its lack of transparency at the start of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always a bit of concern about whether we’re truly getting the full picture,” says Dr Catchpole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Where did hMPV originate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged China to share data on the origins of the Covid outbreak, describing the obligation to do so as “a moral and scientific imperative”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without transparency, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics, the WHO warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the rise in hMPV cases is sparking more concern than it might have done pre-Covid. Infection numbers have been rising in China since mid-December, in both outpatient and emergency cases, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. Amid reports of concerned citizens seeking information about the illness online, authorities have urged people to remain calm and take regular precautions such as frequent washing of hands and avoiding crowded places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sanjaya Senanayake, a specialist in infectious diseases and associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University, has stressed that it is “vital for China to share its data on this outbreak in a timely manner”. In widely reported comments, he added: “This includes epidemiologic data about who is getting infected. Also, we will need genomic data confirming that hMPV is the culprit, and that there aren’t any significant mutations of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

Inside this polymer skull, the donut-shaped ball of living brain tissue floated in a warm, salty bath, its neurons whispering to each other in the darkness. Then a piston struck the platform, whipping it back and forth, and sending the mini-brain sloshing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days later, as the team assessed the damage, the results were stark. Some of the human brain-like tissue had been housing a latent infection with a herpes virus, the type that causes cold sores. And the impact of the piston — intended to mimic a concussion — had woken that virus up. In those tissues, the researchers found lots of inflammation, newly formed plaques of sticky amyloid proteins, and all around them dying neurons — the signature marks of Alzheimer’s disease. Meanwhile, infection-free brain tissues recovered from the concussion with just a bit of lingering inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Decades of epidemiological data have shown that infections with herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1 can raise the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in certain people. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Schneider-Dementia.pdf"&gt;So can a history of head injury&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday in Science Signaling, is the first to connect the dots between them, and adds to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/18/dementia-alzheimers-evidence-for-viral-cause-grows/"&gt;mounting evidence&lt;/a&gt; that this most common form of dementia can be caused by an everyday microbe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s super exciting work,” said Elaine Lim, an assistant professor at UMass Chan Medical School, who studies the role of genetics and the environment in Alzheimer’s disease and was not involved in the study. “The group discovered that traumatic brain injury is one of the ways to get inflammation that is able to result in reactivation of HSV-1, and that has a whole bunch of implications.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that athletes, military personnel, and other people suffering concussions could be triggering the reanimation of latent infections in the brain that can lead to Alzheimer’s later in life. More work needs to be done, but the proposed mechanism points to the use of antiviral drugs as a potential early preventive treatment. “The idea is if you have this sort of injury, it can reactivate HSV-1, which is present in most people whether they know it or not,” said Dana Cairns, a stem cell biologist at Tufts who led the work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of adults over the age of 60 are estimated to have been infected with HSV-1 at some time in their lives. It’s a virus that never really goes away, even after the immune system kicks in and the cold sores disappear. Instead, HSV-1 goes silent, burrowing into neurons and leaving behind copies of its genome with the potential to restart infections when the immune system is weakened. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is highly prevalent, usually in latent (dormant) form, in elderly human brains, and in people carrying a specific genetic factor, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/06/alzheimers-disease-research-apoe4-gene-risk-factor/"&gt;APOE4&lt;/a&gt;, it confers a strong risk of Alzheimer’s,” Ruth Itzhaki, a visiting professorial fellow at the University of Oxford and co-author on the paper, told STAT in an email. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Itzhaki discovered HSV-1 in the brains of elderly people who died with Alzheimer’s — the first indication that infectious agents might play a role in the disease. Although she and a few other researchers have long pursued a “microbial theory” of Alzheimer’s, for decades their work was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/25/alzheimers-cabal-thwarted-progress-toward-cure/"&gt;pushed to the sidelines&lt;/a&gt; by funders and journal editors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the field has historically focused on the amyloid plaques that build up between neurons and tau tangles that spread inside neurons as the primary driver of the disease. Removing these plaques is the strategy behind recently approved but &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/08/how-a-scientific-journals-grotesque-overreaction-inflamed-the-contentious-debate-over-biogens-alzheimers-drug/"&gt;controversial drugs&lt;/a&gt; like Aduhelm, Leqembi, and Kisunla. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is starting to change, with the National Institute on Aging and the Infectious Diseases Society of America inviting scientists to apply for funding to study the role of pathogens in Alzheimer’s in recent years. Cairn and Lim are among a crop of young researchers using new tools like the 3D brain-balls to further investigate Itzhaki’s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The field has really accelerated as a result of the brain organoid technologies that began booming about 10 years ago,” said Lim, who first began working with lab-grown mini-brains as a postdoc in the Harvard Medical School lab of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/16/george-church-profile/"&gt;genetics pioneer George Church&lt;/a&gt;. “They have contributed a lot to the ability to be able to test the molecular effects of viruses in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The donut-shaped model — which is supported by a silk protein sponge scaffold — used by the Tufts team was first developed in 2014, in the lab of David Kaplan, a senior author on the paper. In 2020, Cairn and her colleagues showed that if they infected the human brain-like tissue with HSV-1 in the lab, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/06/researchers-show-herpes-link-to-alzheimers/"&gt;they developed characteristics of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, including clumps of beta-amyloid. Two years later, together with Itzhaki, Cairn found that a dormant version of the virus &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-220287" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;could be reawakened by another virus&lt;/a&gt; — the one that causes chickenpox and shingles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Varicella zoster virus, or VZV, as it’s known, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/18/dementia-alzheimers-evidence-for-viral-cause-grows/"&gt;is associated with elevated risks of developing dementia &lt;/a&gt;and studies have shown those risks can be reduced by getting a shingles vaccine. The brain-ball work suggested an explanation for how that happened; VZV creates a firestorm of inflammation that reactivates HSV-1, which kickstarts the process of plaque formation and neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest work shows that a traumatic brain injury can create the same sort of inflammatory spark.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Li-Huei Tsai, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/12/07/alzheimers-biotech-startup/"&gt;a pioneering Alzheimer’s researcher&lt;/a&gt; at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the donut-shaped model used by the Tufts team is different from a traditional organoid model where free-floating neural stem cells differentiate and self-organize into 3D tissue structures that mimic some aspects of the brain. Still, the results convincingly show that physical impacts to the brain-like tissue could reactivate latent HSV-1 and exacerbate Alzheimer’s-related features. “These are interesting findings,” she said in an email. “However, more validations are necessary, such as using animal models.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lim, whose own team has also found that acute HSV-1 infection &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.21.585957v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;leads to Alzheimer’s pathology in brain organoids&lt;/a&gt; as well as profound changes in gene expression associated with the disease, said that the latest work addresses one of the biggest criticisms of the microbial theory of Alzheimer’s: HSV-1’s ubiquity. Alzheimer’s impacts only about 10% of the population — if HSV-1 were causing it, why are there so many people who are repositories of the virus but not developing the disease? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That has been a tricky thing for the field to reconcile,” Lim said. “This paper shows that multiple insults that lead to inflammation in the brain can reactivate latent herpes viruses, showing a mechanism for triggering Alzheimer’s-like dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For both Lim and Cairns, who have looked up to Itzhaki and her perseverance in the face of decades of hostility from the Alzheimer’s research establishment, it’s gratifying to see the insights generated by the mini-brain models starting to change perceptions about the possibility that common viruses like HSV-1 could cause neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When she was pitching a lot of these ideas in the ’90s, she was treated as a heretic,” said Cairns. “Viruses have historically been tied to cancer, and that’s more of an accepted thing, but this idea that they can really impact neurological outcomes, I think is really gathering a lot of steam at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

During the week of December 5 (which is the most recent data available), there were 91 suspected or confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported to state health departments across the country. By comparison, there were just 41 suspected or confirmed outbreaks during the same week from 2021 to 2024. Basically, there’s a ton of norovirus floating around out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is no joke—it can cause vomiting and diarrhea (often at the same time), making for a miserable experience. With that, it’s understandable to want to lower the odds you’ll get the virus and be aware of early signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about symptoms of norovirus, plus what to do if you’re unlucky enough to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: Infectious disease expert &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amesh A.

Those can include having direct contact with someone who has the virus, eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus, and touching contaminated objects or surfaces and then putting your unwashed hands in your mouth, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fnorovirus%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20355296&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa63360883%2Fnorovirus-symptoms%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noroviruses can survive for up to 12 hours on hard surfaces, according to the United Kingdom's &lt;a href="https://mft.nhs.uk/app/uploads/sites/15/2021/03/NMGH-Norovirus.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Health Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;. On contaminated carpet, the virus can last up to 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best way to treat norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no set treatment for norovirus, and medications like antibiotics won’t do anything to help you to feel better, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, supportive care is best, Adalja says. That includes doing things like taking small, frequent sips of liquids to try to prevent dehydration and taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19907722/what-you-need-to-know-about-acetaminophen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; to help with body aches and a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to recover from norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news with norovirus (if there is any) is that most people tend to feel better within one to three days, per the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long are you contagious with norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people get over norovirus in a few days, you can be contagious for a lot longer than that. In fact, you can still spread norovirus for up to two weeks after you feel better, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I protect myself from the norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is uncomfortable for everyone, Adalja says it’s particularly concerning for people who are susceptible to becoming dehydrated—“usually the very young and the very old.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower the odds you’ll get sick with norovirus, he recommends doing your best to avoid people who are obviously sick and washing your hands often. That's really all you can do, Adalja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, norovirus infections can and do happen. “Norovirus is a ubiquitous virus that everyone experiences multiple times in their life,” Adalja says. The best you can do is try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:49:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOd05ockhfSUVQdUxFbzRnSXJWS0VyNUViSWlYUUVmMzhmai1RRXlxQl9MTFU5Y0lKd3BGMkpac0g5OS15UDQ1aWxta0tnQ2xuMmpleVBLOFduVk9WTTdUN1RqUVRVbjVSdmVFYXlGUHRYNzhNeUNpSDZwX0ZrTFlVQndB</guid></item><item><title>Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease attributable to sugar beverages - Hacker News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE1WTGpDMFJfcW51ZjFvME1fWnczdUtrVEhYbGNzMG9WbEZrWm1pV2JmOWxLQTZWMWVKZ3FhQ2k1RTFNMXV1LWl3NDFyeWZOcWZGTW41Vm9FMzI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:36:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE1WTGpDMFJfcW51ZjFvME1fWnczdUtrVEhYbGNzMG9WbEZrWm1pV2JmOWxLQTZWMWVKZ3FhQ2k1RTFNMXV1LWl3NDFyeWZOcWZGTW41Vm9FMzI</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine makers’ shares jump after bird flu death in US - Financial Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE91d3lzM2JWbjh5dFZ3dzk2RHZqRWVpV25EMFBEc3BXMnRGMHBsZnE5R19sT01ZdF90S19fcmpjb1ZJWkZ4UVU0TFY5QTZtdGNqWjVmckt3RTlSd2tZdEF2RkFWRFNHWURSV2treVV6ck0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="card-content css-1r5kwgd"&gt;&lt;p class="o-grid-row css-1pou09k"&gt;&lt;span class="price css-79fz17"&gt;$29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; per 3 months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row o-spacing-s3 details-section css-n8oanw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

    &lt;p&gt;The landscape of street drugs looked a lot different when University of Washington research professor Caleb Banta-Green began his career in drug epidemiology more than 20 years ago. There were just seven illicit drugs he had to keep track of: cannabis, meth, cocaine, heroin, PCP, LSD and MDMA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in today’s “era of synthetics,” that number has swelled to more than 200, with more hitting the streets every day, including sedatives, animal tranquilizers and an industrial chemical used by plastic manufacturers, according to Banta-Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasingly “messy drug supply” — especially of illicit fentanyl — is making street drugs more dangerous, as their potency and contents are almost impossible to know without extensive testing, he said. And researchers and care providers are struggling to keep up with new chemicals hitting the market, including learning how to treat people who have used substances never intended for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is by far the most complicated thing I’ve done,” Banta-Green said. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole and we can’t keep up, and it’s getting out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banta-Green is director of the UW &lt;a href="https://adai.uw.edu/cedeer/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Center for Community-Engaged Drug Education, Epidemiology and Research&lt;/a&gt;, where he and a team of 15 researchers study opioids and treatments for opioid use disorder. Last year, they collaborated with eight “drug checking” organizations in Washington to test drug samples collected from people across the state and get a better sense of which chemicals and substances are present in the region’s illicit drug supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often, people brought in drug samples for testing — sometimes as small as a shard of a pill or powder residue left in a plastic bag — because they were worried about what it might contain. This was sometimes because their drugs had an unfamiliar chemical smell or because they caused unusual side effects, including intense headaches or lung pain, Banta-Green said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug samples are tested on-site using test strips, which can quickly detect the presence of fentanyl, the powerful animal tranquilizer xylazine and benzodiazepines.  Samples then&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are tested using a spectrometer, which can detect the presence of methamphetamines&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Most samples are sent to a lab for a chemical analysis, where they could detect a wider range of chemical compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests of 816 drug samples between June 1 and Nov. 30 revealed the presence of 237 unique drugs and substances, findings that stunned Banta-Green and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some were drugs people have heard of,” he said. “And some weren’t even drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18060296-2023135051" class="st-image-gallery column-width-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"column-width-embed","images":[{"id":18060296,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=300x199 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=1024x678 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=768x508 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=1536x1016 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=2048x1355 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=780x516 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=1020x675 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=1560x1032 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=2040x1350 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=375x248 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01032025_supply_131913.jpg?d=780x516","caption":"Caleb Banta-Green, director of the UW Center for Community-Engaged Drug Education, Epidemiology and Research, speaks at a roundtable discussion with local leaders held by U.

But others showed the presence of chemical compounds and drugs that are either not meant for human use or intended for other purposes, including procaine and lidocaine — local anesthetics used to numb or block pain during medical procedures — and xylazine, Banta-Green said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most concerning was the presence of substances that could be deadly even in small amounts, either because of their potency or because they’ve never been tested on humans before. That included 12 samples containing carfentanil, an opioid that is 10,000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl, and BTMPS, an industrial chemical used in plastics that was found in nearly half of all samples of drugs sold as fentanyl, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of cutting agents in street drugs is common, as manufacturers often add in other substances to reduce costs. But the variety of substances detected last year in Washington state’s drug supply, along with the number of unique substances found in individual samples, is new — and likely due to the country’s efforts to crack down on fentanyl, Banta-Green said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. efforts with China to block and ban the “precursors for fentanyl” has led Mexican cartels who produce the drugs to experiment, including by cutting their products with new substances, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug trafficking organizations still want to make money and still have a huge demand, so they’ll do their best to adapt,” he said. “They’ve got barely trained chemists making stuff up, and that’s all of our sense is the drivers on this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a supply of street drugs in which users can’t know what’s in the drugs they’re buying, even if they’re buying from the same dealer or from the same batch, increasing the risk of accidental overdoses, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Reames, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Seattle Field Division, said the federal agency has also detected a similar increase in other substances in the state’s drug supply, including finding xylazine in about a quarter of fentanyl samples tested in the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the variety of new substances was likely a result of Mexican cartels adapting to U.S. efforts to crack down on fentanyl. But this change coincided with a decrease in the potency of illicit fentanyl being sold, a sign their efforts are working, Reames said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, 7 out of 10 pills sold as fentanyl that were tested by the DEA contained 2 mg of the drug, which the agency considers a lethal dose. This year, 5 out of 10 pills contained that amount, he said. The decrease in the potency is a mark of the success they’ve had at trying to tackle all areas of the drug trade, including working with China to prevent the flow of fentanyl ingredients to Mexican cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reames acknowledged there are risks to the new substances being found in the area’s drug supply, including that opioid overdose reversal drugs, like Narcan, do not combat the effects of overdosing on other substances like xylazine. And a less reliable drug supply could result in more people ingesting substances they don’t mean to, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have no idea what’s in these drugs, fentanyl and methamphetamines both, but fentanyl specifically,” Reames said. “Whatever (the cartels) decide goes in, goes in.” &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;While it’s too early to tell the consequences of these new substances, Banta-Green said efforts are well underway in Seattle and King County to reduce and protect against overdoses of the most common drugs, especially fentanyl. Their efforts include “saturating the market” with Narcan, increasing drop-in addiction services, opening a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/seattle-to-open-post-overdose-recovery-center/" class="content-link"&gt;postoverdose recovery center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Seattle and launching a pilot program where Seattle firefighters and EMTs &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/seattle-becomes-first-u-s-city-where-emts-can-administer-buprenorphine/" class="content-link"&gt;can administer buprenorphine&lt;/a&gt;, a medication to treat opioid use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the region won’t see a serious reduction in the number of people dying from opioid overdoses until medications like buprenorphine and methadone become as easy, and as cheap, to get as fentanyl, Banta-Green said. The need for those medications becomes more urgent as new and untested chemicals hit the market, a trend that shows no sign of stopping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people use fentanyl a dozen times a day, every day of the year, and every one of those is an overdose opportunity because the fentanyl here is so unpredictable,” he said. “In the era of synthetics, we’re never going to go backward — it’s always going to be synthetic and there’s always going to be innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story was updated to clarify the drug testing process and correct the number of researchers at the UW Center for Community-Engaged Drug Education, Epidemiology and Research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The raptor twice found enough energy to briefly fly, the second time into a wooded area where it was later found and captured by handlers from Midwest Bird Collision Monitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It definitely was having trouble flying, and I knew it was something neurological, which is a sign of bird flu,” Meyers said. “I wasn’t surprised to find out that was what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day, the eagle was euthanized at the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County’s DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center after it was suspected of being infected with &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/01/06/bird-flu-death-louisiana/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, according to Beth Schirott, a spokeswoman for the Forest Preserve District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew before it ever got here that it was very likely bird flu, based on the clinical signs,” said Sarah Reich, head veterinarian for the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center, previously known as the Willowbrook Wildlife Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_17881744" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PPN-L-hinsdale-eagle-bird-flu-0109-01.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="A bald eagle initially spotted in distress in Hinsdale stands in an animal crate after being captured by responders from Chicago Bird Collision Monitors.

(Annette Prince/Chicago Bird Collision Monitors)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reich said bird flu was first reported in the United States at the end of 2021, but &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/12/23/illinois-bird-flu/"&gt;instances of infection are on the rise in the area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It pops up and goes away,” she said. “This variant seems to be a little more aggressive. The risk for human infection is considered low, but we recommend that people don’t touch animals that may have this. It’s hard for people not to rescue birds in distress, but we suggest that they just walk away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reich said bird flu is spread by particles, meaning someone doesn’t have to actually touch an infected animal to be exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This variant of bird flu, a highly pathogenic avian influenza also known as HPAI and H5N1, has been spreading across the country. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources in late December indicated it is &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/resource-center/news/2024/december/release-20241220.html"&gt;“monitoring a large event of waterfowl mortality at numerous locations throughout Illinois.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant has been positively identified in multiple bird species in Illinois, according to information from the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. District officials are alarmed enough to have implemented precautions. For one, the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center has stopped accepting waterfowl or other aquatic birds for any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our highest priority is the safety of our staff, volunteers, patients and resident animals,” Reich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While low pathogenicity avian influenza circulates naturally and is routinely found in wild waterfowl and shorebird populations, such as geese, ducks, and gulls, which generally do not show any significant signs of disease, highly pathogenic avian influenza is similar to the human influenza virus, or flu. And like human flu, it’s hard to stay ahead of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It changes every year, requiring a different vaccine,” Reich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza can infect domestic poultry, resulting in high sickness and death rates, officials said, and in this current outbreak, cattle, cats and other mammals also are susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread to humans is unlikely but still possible, officials said. Clinical signs can include mild flu-like symptoms, such as fever and upper respiratory signs, to severe respiratory disease or pneumonia. People with close and prolonged exposure to infected birds are at much higher risk, including those who work in wildlife rehabilitation centers or farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center is urging people to not feed waterfowl or aquatic birds, but songbirds are considered low-risk, so they aren’t yet recommending removal of backyard feeders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Natural Resources is monitoring the progression of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Instances of five or more dead or dying birds in one location within a 24-hour period can be reported to the IDNR biologists at &lt;a href="https://wildlifeillinois.org/idnr-district-wildlife-biologist/"&gt;https://wildlifeillinois.org/idnr-district-wildlife-biologist/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chuck Fieldman is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But despite this, he has found that many doctors are unaware that it’s a threat, largely because until relatively recently, no one was testing for it outside of academic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There’s no question that even within the medical community, a lot of physicians are just not aware of how common hMPV is,” he says. “As clinical testing has become more available, I’ve had people say to me, with surprise, ‘I had a patient in my ICU with metapneumovirus last week. It’s real, and I never believed it before.’ Until people see it themselves, I think they don’t totally believe the burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Vermund says that there have likely been many spikes of hMPV infections in the past, but we were either not aware of them or mistook them for influenza. He explains that one of the consequences of Covid has been a recognition of the need for greater surveillance of circulating respiratory viruses, meaning that hMPV case numbers are being detected by epidemiologists for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The Chinese have become quite advanced at molecular diagnostics for respiratory viruses and they’re doing a lot of public health surveillance, more than many other countries,” he says. “I think what we may be seeing is that they’re doing an especially good job at this, and so finding that metapneumovirus is more common than we used to realize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Williams believes that the current spike of interest in hMPV could have positive consequences for public health. Right now, he says that hMPV can only be detected as part of a so-called multiplex panel, a diagnostic that checks for the presence of up to 25 different respiratory viruses, at a cost of around $200 per patient. While this is a worthwhile investment for emergency room doctors deciding whether to admit a sick infant or send them home, such costs are often prohibitive for ordinary physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There are cheap tests for flu, Covid, and RSV that can be used by clinicians anywhere,” he says. “But there’s not really any cheap test for hMPV, just this complex diagnostic panel which assesses multiple viruses and that’s hard for the average clinic to get hold of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are hopes that low-cost testing for hMPV could be on the way. According to Vermund, the Ragon Institute in Massachusetts is working on ways of trying to reduce the price of respiratory virus testing to under $6 per patient, with the ultimate goal of driving the cost down to less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Equally, another consequence of the increasing awareness surrounding hMPV is that it provides stronger incentives for fast-tracking a vaccine. As yet, no licensed vaccine is available for the virus, but a series of candidates have entered &lt;a data-offer-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05664334" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05664334"}' href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05664334" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early-stage clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Last summer, scientists at the University of Oxford &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.paediatrics.ox.ac.uk/news/new-trial-launches-for-two-in-one-vaccine-to-prevent-rsv-and-hmpv" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.paediatrics.ox.ac.uk/news/new-trial-launches-for-two-in-one-vaccine-to-prevent-rsv-and-hmpv"}' href="https://www.paediatrics.ox.ac.uk/news/new-trial-launches-for-two-in-one-vaccine-to-prevent-rsv-and-hmpv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launched a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of a combined RSV and hMPV vaccine in partnership with Moderna, and Andrew Pollard, a professor of infection and immunity who directs the Oxford Vaccine Group, says that adding hMPV to existing vaccines would be the most practical means of rolling out an additional immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“If you can put them in the same vaccine, so RSV and hMPV, then without needing extra needles, you’re actually covering more of the respiratory admissions to hospital,” says Pollard. “But before we can do that, we need to find out how often you need to vaccinate against hMPV. If you can provide immunity by vaccinating every few years, then you could combine with RSV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Overall, Vermund describes the sudden interest in hMPV as an important development. While the virus won’t trigger the next pandemic, it still afflicts such a significant number of people that it’s a major drain on public health systems, as well as being a long-underrecognized cause of mortality in the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Even though metapneumovirus is not one of the more lethal viruses, it’s incredibly common,” he says. “It’s been causing a nontrivial amount of colds over the years, which is an incredible economic burden, and every once in a while, it kills somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:42:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPSnlfRTZCMnpGWGJiNnBWQ2YtcGNfUG9FUDV2M2llTTN3Ty1qRXdSRnA2QjNUOHF5bjU0VER4WXJNT2hxSFp3NVVhX3RZbGdFc2FmM0ZhWVJTZWZ3MGlmQ095M3NCOTgyWXRHZGFKbk5UMUhWa0czV0xoeHVvNnRFSlJjczNyejRicmtHcjZuc2h4UWhJaDI4VVJ2YVRlYkc1b0pEamotSlFDVjlpUkR6YQ</guid></item><item><title>Moderna Stock Soars After First US Bird-Flu Death - Investopedia</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQd0FURHkzOEc4MjNpS0pWYjhfVmZHY1FJY01UVFl5VUxjUjQzWGxqYURoUTdFRjVnNHhvdnEtbHlzWWdjeGRLWXc4ZnlDNWN0aDdEQzNvVEtBVDl2OEpEcDJ0b3NBdlA3VG1zZUt1dXlCMGJ4alN6S05TaXZ6Y2FaVU1SRnRlcDZDNXViSVljRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block article-body-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="80" data-sc-ad-label-height="0" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="90" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="1" data-sc-content-positions="[300, 1, 1, 1250, 1, 1, 1, 1]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-callout mntl-block"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-whatyouneedtoknow" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="firstL"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="firstL"&gt;The majority of the world is right-handed; left-handers find themselves buying special scissors, can openers, and even pens and pencils. But even a global rate of 10% is a drastic increase from 100 years ago. Historically, those with left-handed laterality have been considered inferior and unclean—the word “sinister” comes from “sinistrality,” the scientific term for left-handedness. So, when did these ideas start, and how did they express themselves? Moreover, where are we still seeing them today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rates of Left-Handedness in History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132299" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132299" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handedness-rates-graph.jpg" alt="left handedness rates graph" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handedness-rates-graph.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handedness-rates-graph-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handedness-rates-graph-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handedness-rates-graph-768x537.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132299" class="figure-caption"&gt;Handedness in America since 1800 by Christopher Ingraham, 2015. Source: “The Surprising Geography of Left-Handedness.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is unclear exactly where or when the sentiments of handedness-related bias began, it can be seen throughout several thousand years. In &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/972224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mayan art&lt;/a&gt; from the Classic Period (ca. 400-900 BCE), the left hand represents weakness, even malice. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/what-were-aristotle-contributions-to-biology/"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt; believed left-handedness was the result of poor mothers or physical inferiority. In a study of almost 1,200 artworks dating back 5,000 years, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.335510" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Stanley Coren and Clare Porac&lt;/a&gt; discovered that 93% of subjects depicted using tools were operating them with their right hand. It appears, as Coren puts it, that “man has always been right-handed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132302" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132302" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid-vertical" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mayan-relief-carving.jpg" alt="mayan relief carving" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mayan-relief-carving.jpg 1188w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mayan-relief-carving-297x300.jpg 297w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mayan-relief-carving-1014x1024.jpg 1014w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mayan-relief-carving-768x776.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132302" class="figure-caption"&gt;Relief with Enthroned Ruler, Unknown, 770s CE. Source: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, tragically little information exists on rates of left-handedness before the 19th century, when it began to be studied in depth. But given Coren and Porac’s findings and the extensive history of texts citing left-handedness as a physical and moral failing, we can assume that the rate has been consistently low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

However, bias against left-handers is old and well-ingrained, and even now, we can see the consequences of such ideas in our daily lives, from the classroom to the kitchen drawer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can We Learn More About Historical Handedness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132298" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flint-knapping-demonstration.jpg" alt="flint knapping demonstration" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flint-knapping-demonstration.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flint-knapping-demonstration-300x189.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flint-knapping-demonstration-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flint-knapping-demonstration-768x483.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132298" class="figure-caption"&gt;Ben Cunningham-Summerfield demonstrates flint-knapping at an art festival, 2012. Source: National Park Service&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that the majority of the world has been right-handed since the first early humans emerged 3 to 4 million years ago. However, there is very little information on the rate of left-handedness before the 19th century—so little that archeologist Nigel Sadler described left-handers as “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511576744.004" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a people without a history&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changed when revolutionary physicians, including Ernest Auburtin, Paul Broca, and Marc Dax, began theorizing that different parts of the brain are responsible for different behaviors and functions. Shortly afterward, physician &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20896371/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;William Ogle&lt;/a&gt; asked 2,000 patients at St. George’s Hospital in London what hand they favored. Approximately 4.25% of patients responded that they favored the left, and Ogle’s study is considered the first of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, historians and anthropologists have very few ways to study rates of handedness prior to this era. As a result, experts in multiple fields have turned to working on indirect evidence in order to bridge the gap of knowledge. For some archeologists, this means turning to ancient biology, specifically osteology, the study of bones. Investigators in these studies have argued that &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oa.1390050105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;bone asymmetries&lt;/a&gt; are a factor by which we can determine the laterality of an individual; however, many of these studies have been refuted, as this has been proved to be an unreliable indicator of handedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, studies of tools such as hammers, knives, and writing instruments have shown great promise.  An &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1357650X.2013.769559" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; with a group of stone-knappers showed that handedness greatly affected factors such as the shape, ridges, and impact point of stone tools. More &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X20301073" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, including those actually using &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/stonehenge-ancient-tools-point-to-more-advanced-society-than-known/"&gt;stone tools&lt;/a&gt; rather than just making them, continue to give archeologists hope for uncovering sinistrality’s hidden past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religious Views of Handedness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132295" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/creation-adam-public.jpg" alt="creation adam public" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/creation-adam-public.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/creation-adam-public-300x134.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/creation-adam-public-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/creation-adam-public-768x342.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132295" class="figure-caption"&gt;The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo, c. 1508-1512. Source: rawpixel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative views of sinistrality date thousands of years in the past, and many of these ideas trace back to religion. In the Bible, the image of God’s “right hand” as a good and righteous place is referenced numerous times throughout the text—but nowhere does the Bible mention God’s left hand. The left hand appears to be associated with sin and wickedness, something that contributed to the development of the term “sinistrality” as a term for left-handedness. In Matthew 6:3, it is written: “But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing” (NIV). &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2857068" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Priests were required to do rituals with their right hand&lt;/a&gt;, and some even believed left-handers to be &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.4.193" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;possessed by the devil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, such discrimination is also seen in &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/four-jewish-sects/"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;. The Jewish scholar Maimonides considered left-handedness to be a “blemish,” and he went so far as to list it as a quality that would disqualify an individual from serving in the &lt;a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1097194/jewish/The-Right-and-Left-Way.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Jerusalem Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Left and right symbolism is seen throughout Judaism: the &lt;i&gt;yetzer hara, &lt;/i&gt;or “evil urge,” is traditionally associated with the left side. Likewise, the mezuzah, a scroll with important Torah verses that remind Jews of their obligations to God, is attached to the &lt;a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/august-13-international-left-handers-day" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;right side of the doorway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity and Judaism are not alone in this bias. &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.4.193" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Similar symbols and ideas are seen in religions throughout the world&lt;/a&gt;, including Hinduism and &lt;a href="https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/platforum/article/view/19872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, and have contributed to the negative views of sinistrality throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handedness in Medieval Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132297" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/deesis-mosaic-haga-sophia.jpg" alt="deesis mosaic haga sophia" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/deesis-mosaic-haga-sophia.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/deesis-mosaic-haga-sophia-300x220.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/deesis-mosaic-haga-sophia-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/deesis-mosaic-haga-sophia-768x563.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132297" class="figure-caption"&gt;Deesis Mosaic in the Haga Sophia photograph by Robyn Stewart, 2015. Source: Pixabay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being born left-handed in medieval Europe did not earn you any favors; you were considered cursed or, in the worst cases, devil-possessed. An excellent example of how this bias manifested in medieval Europe is the &lt;a href="https://name.umdl.umich.edu/GRom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gesta Romanorum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;a well-known collection of moral stories published in the 14th century. One tale of note is the story of Guido (or “Gwido”), a poor man who rescues a wealthy steward from an animal attack. Instead of being grateful, the steward ignores him and denies ever knowing Guido. After being beaten when trying to seek out the steward, Guido is found by his wife:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When his wife heard this, she came with her donkey / and gave the steward her blessing with the left / hand; and carried home her husband, and spent / on him all that she might get, till he had his health” (trans. by author).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been argued that Guido’s wife using her left hand is meant to be facetious or sarcastic. After all, she is “blessing” the man who has just beaten her husband unconscious. The &lt;a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED25474/track?counter=2&amp;amp;search_id=63863488" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; (or “lift” in Middle English) was often meant to be sinister or unfortunate and, when paired with “honde” (&lt;a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED21102" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;hand&lt;/a&gt;), referred to a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this line appears to be missing from &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/gestaromanorum00hoopgoog/page/212/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;later translations&lt;/a&gt;. It appears to have been added by Middle English translator Wynkyn de Worde, perhaps as a bit of “flavor.” This addition presents an interesting piece of evidence that the “blessing” given by Guido’s wife is actually a curse, especially since blessings, such as the one above, were done exclusively with the right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superstitions &amp;amp; Scientific Ideas About Left-Handers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132296" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/davinci-last-supper.jpg" alt="davinci last supper" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/davinci-last-supper.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/davinci-last-supper-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/davinci-last-supper-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/davinci-last-supper-768x397.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132296" class="figure-caption"&gt;The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, c. 1495-1498. Source: rawpixel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throw salt over your left shoulder” is a popular superstition for those looking to rid themselves of &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/541285" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;bad luck&lt;/a&gt;. The superstition, sometimes attributed to Judas Iscariot spilling salt at the &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/works-inspired-da-vinci-last-supper/"&gt;Last Supper&lt;/a&gt;, reflects the old belief of a devil that sits on or stalks behind the left shoulder (Dent &amp;amp; Brewer, 2013). Throwing the salt back is meant to blind him, thus ridding you of his influence. Other superstitions, such as wearing rings on the left hand for protection or babies who reject the left breast of their mothers, are to become &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/unusual-patron-saints/"&gt;saints&lt;/a&gt;, are now outdated (Dent &amp;amp; Brewer, 2013). However, all of these bygone myths offer more evidence of a long-standing bias toward the left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such bias can be seen even in the scientific community. Over the past 200 years, many theories have been proposed that left-handers are inclined to malevolence and disabilities and are even more accident-prone. Two opposing researchers, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1357650X.2012.697171" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cesare Lombroso and Robert Hertz&lt;/a&gt;, penned paramount works on the matter. Lombroso’s theory stated that the left-handed were inherently criminal, whereas Hertz defended left-handers and called for an end to handedness-based discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132294" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/arnold-palmer-pga.jpg" alt="arnold palmer pga" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/arnold-palmer-pga.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/arnold-palmer-pga-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/arnold-palmer-pga-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/arnold-palmer-pga-768x512.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132294" class="figure-caption"&gt;Left-handed golf champion Arnold Palmer by Chris Condon, 2007. Source: NBC News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, works such as Stanley Coren’s &lt;i&gt;The Left-Hander Syndrome&lt;/i&gt; which theorize that left-handers are more prone to illness, among other things, have sparked discourse in the scientific community (Coren, 2012). Conversely, researchers such as Clare Porac, who has spent more than 40 years investigating handedness, believe that this is simply not the case. Porac argues that left-handers show no particular inclination towards any of these negative traits. In her book &lt;i&gt;Laterality: Exploring the Enigma of Left-Handedness, &lt;/i&gt;Porac actually showcases many advantages, such as their skills in interactive sports and talent in science and mathematics (Porac, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Porac, left-handers are often simply victims of circumstance, living in a world that is not designed for them—one that is sometimes even outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Modern Consequences of Anti-Sinistral Bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132300" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handed-typewriter.jpg" alt="left handed typewriter" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handed-typewriter.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handed-typewriter-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handed-typewriter-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/left-handed-typewriter-768x481.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132300" class="figure-caption"&gt;A photo of a Maltron ergonomic keyboard by Michael Hicks. Source: Flickr&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for the rising number of left-handers is almost certainly increased cultural acceptance. During the &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/industrial-revolution-social-impact/"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, it was not uncommon to see children discouraged or even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7591/9781501725494-006" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;punished&lt;/a&gt; for using their left hand. Such punishments were not exclusive to Europe or the Americas; in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.education.gov.au/system/files/consultations/Leftys%20Left%20Handed%20Products%20and%20Resources.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;left-handed children&lt;/a&gt; sometimes had their left hands tied to chairs or were forced to sit on them while writing. Likewise, the bias toward left-handers is not a thing of the past, either. China has among the lowest rates of left-handedness, and many school children are similarly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23375555/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;pressured to use their right hands&lt;/a&gt; for everyday activities such as writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that up to two-thirds of the world still faces handedness-based discrimination. Being forced to change handedness can lead to myriad mental and physical problems—forcibly switching a child’s handedness has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.education.gov.au/system/files/consultations/Leftys%20Left%20Handed%20Products%20and%20Resources.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;speech disorders, poor motor skills, and low self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;. All of these contribute to lower test scores in the classroom, bullying from peers, and can negatively affect an individual’s outlook on writing and learning for the rest of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A less talked-about consequence of right-handed bias is simply the lack of availability of left-hand-oriented products. Can openers, musical instruments, notebooks, and writing utensils are usually designed for right-handed users. &lt;a href="https://www.leftyslefthanded.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Entire stores&lt;/a&gt; specialize in creating products designed to suit left-handed users, as most stores do not carry suitable options. Even small things, like school desks with right-hand surfaces or the orientation of cup holders in cars, are daily annoyances for the left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, Will Left-Hand Usage Increase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_132303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132303" class="figure"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class="figure-img img-fluid" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/president-obama-speech.jpg" alt="president obama speech" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/president-obama-speech.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/president-obama-speech-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/president-obama-speech-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/president-obama-speech-768x482.jpg 768w"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132303" class="figure-caption"&gt;A photo of President Barack Obama delivering remarks during a memorial service, US Government, 2013. Source: rawpixel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As society becomes less conservative and old biases toward those who are different begin to fade, we will almost certainly begin to see an increase in left-handed individuals. Although these results will certainly be much more apparent 100 years from now, even in the short term, cultural acceptance has allowed more individuals to grow up more comfortable with using their left hand. Many famous left-handers include actor Tom Cruise, singer Paul McCartney, and former US President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study of 1,200 Japanese students in 1993 showed a significant increase in the rate of left-handedness compared with the first data set, which was taken in 1973. Among other factors, such as the nature of writing katakana, the authors attribute cultural change from &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/how-japan-get-involved-world-war-ii/"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; as part of the reason for such a change. The original study estimated that approximately &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250387052_Handedness_and_footedness_in_members_of_general_Japanese_population" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;3.09% of the Japanese population&lt;/a&gt; was right-handed. Although Japan remains one of the countries with the fewest left-handed individuals at only 4.7%, the discrepancy between that and the original 1974 sample suggests that Japan’s left-handed population will likely continue to increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As numbers rise in countries with lower rates of left-handedness, such as Japan and China, there is a good chance we will see this reflected in the global percentage. Left-handers are gaining more traction in the world through little things like left-handed scissors or opportunities like the &lt;a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/left-hand.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Frederick and Mary F. Buckley scholarship&lt;/a&gt; created specifically for left-handers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you find yourself bumping elbows with a left-handed friend at dinner or see them struggling with a right-handed can opener, give them a smile and some space. And when the holidays come around, maybe even surprise them with a gift card for their favorite left-handed store.&lt;/p&gt;

RSV causes cold-like symptoms and affects the breathing passages and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wastewater levels of RSV are "moderate" nationwide for the week ending Dec. 28, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/RSV-nationaltrend.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the CDC's wastewater monitoring systems&lt;/a&gt;. Wastewater levels of RSV rose to moderate in mid-December – the first time it reached moderate since January 2024. Since then, RSV levels in wastewater had been "minimal" or "low," according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Respiratory viruses can spread quickly in winter months, as more people spend time inside. Colder temperatures can weaken your immune system, and colder, drier air can help respiratory viruses thrive, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/12/16/cold-weather-sick-winter-respiratory-viruses/76600636007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;experts say.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Wastewater maps show where levels of COVID, flu and RSV are high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wastewater testing is intended to act as an early warning system for public health professionals, allowing them to prevent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even in cases when a community's residents are not showing symptoms, it is possible to test wastewater, or sewage, for the presence of infectious diseases.

Does one diet rule above them all? A study looked at biological samples from over 21,000 individuals to find out, revealing key differences among dietary preferences, and that there’s one thing we can all strive for to improve our gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Following diets that include or exclude major food groups such as meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables leaves its mark on the gut microbiome, which we characterized here by leveraging an integrated, multinational, metagenomic cohort of unprecedented size (21,561 individuals) with self-reported diet patterns,” wrote the authors. “We found strong microbiome configurations for vegans, vegetarians and omnivores with several characteristic microbes that confirm and expand upon several previous findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their unprecedented dataset, the researchers discovered that although vegan and vegetarian participants had healthier diets than omnivores, the omnivores studied had a higher rate of gut microbiome diversity. Sounds like a win for the omnivores, except that gut microbiome diversity alone isn’t a reliable measurement of how healthy that microbiome is. That’s because different bacteria have different influences on our guts and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/can-you-think-yourself-well-77274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wider health&lt;/a&gt;, and not all of them are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed each dietary pattern had unique microbial signatures. The gut microbiomes of omnivores contained higher levels of bacteria that are associated with meat digestion, which figures, including &lt;em&gt;Alistipes putredinis&lt;/em&gt;. However, their increased diversity included bacteria like &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcus torques&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bilophila wadsworthia&lt;/em&gt;, bacteria the researchers say are associated with increased risk of disease including inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkwHR7qF-H0??si=SPeKKiV2vydcPYkn&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegans were packing a lot of bacteria that are crucial for fiber fermentation, some of which contribute to the formation of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate. Such bacteria can be good for reducing inflammation, as well as contributing to healthy metabolism and immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for vegetarian Vs vegan, it seems the key difference here came down to dairy as vegetarians had more &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt; in their microbiome signature. This bacterium is used in yogurt production and can influence certain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6723445/" target="_blank"&gt;toxins in the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the study dived into different dietary preferences, one of its key takeaways applied to omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans, as it was found that quality of diet really ruled above all when it came to having a favorable microbiome composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have observed that the quantity and diversity of plant-based foods have a very positive impact on the microbiome,” said study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Nicola Segata in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Avoiding meat or dairy products does not necessarily have a positive effect if it does not come with a variety of quality plant-based products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the point of view of the microbiome, what we can generally recommend is that it is important to eat many plant-based foods, especially those rich in fiber. And that food diversity is important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorful plates at the ready, let 2025 be the year of enjoying all that the vegetable aisle has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01870-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:57:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPcFZYRXNQc1JtbmdPNmhMSjEtbnQ5TGhQRmI0TlgzVTV1aVBER3hEcndadC1OMmQ4N1ZnQXQyRkdGWmhQTDhjdmtqZXUwcVZfUGdsZmQ1aDlJMTJwcjBxVE50aVZISlhfdkZ4SjhJZFlfYmluT2ZaV0hIMDFCekh3M1psNDRLaHEwS0p2b2diQUlTSzRNQ2Z5dU9CaHlsN05KYlVfVQ</guid></item><item><title>Doctor reveals the everyday products he'd never allow in his home because of links to tumors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor has revealed the everyday things he would never buy due to the risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-198a4760-cc74-11ef-965b-c1370b1728c3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Will Kang, an orthopedic surgeon in Baltimore, said there are five things his wife, an oncologist, never allows him to buy at the store due to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14182829/colorectal-cancer-expert-five-common-things-never-do.html"&gt;links to several forms of cancer. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent Instagram Reel, Dr Kang revealed there are certain utensils that the couple avoid: non-stick plans and plastic utensils, especially those that are black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These products are made with PFAS, also called 'forever chemicals,' microscopic compounds believed to disrupt hormones like estrogen and lead to breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Black plastic often contains even higher levels of toxic chemicals, including flame retardants, which can leach into food during cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kang told his 60,000 followers: 'I am sharing how we live our humble lives as parents, humans, doctors. We try to make healthy choices as much as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor also revealed he no longer buys processed meats like hot dogs and cold cuts, which a mountain of emerging research has linked to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202563/colon-cancer-explosion-toxins-air-link.html"&gt; increased colon cancer risk in young people. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also walks right past the Skittles in the candy section. The candy has come under fire in recent years for being riddled with dyes like Red 40, which have been banned in some states over fears of hormone imbalances and some cancers in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CUTTING OUT CANCER: Dr Will Kang revealed the things he and his oncologist wife never allows in their home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skittles contain red 40, yellow 5, and blue 1, among other dyes, which give the candy its bright colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red 40 as well as Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 also contain benzene, a human and animal carcinogen permitted in low levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Processed meats like hot dogs and cold cuts contain nitrates, chemicals meant to keep them fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When heated, nitrates can undergo a reaction that turns them into N-nitroso chemicals (NOCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals damage cells lining the colon, making them more prone to cancer-causing mutations and making them more likely to develop into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies processed meat as a group 1 carcinogen, meaning there is clear evidence that it can &lt;a target="_self" href="/debate/article-6698199/JOANNA-BLYTHMAN-Britain-wake-stark-truth.html"&gt;cause cancer in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kang said: 'As someone who grew up on spam, cold cuts, and sausages, cutting this out was tough but I'm glad I did.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Processed meat has been linked to the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14173273/34-colon-cancer-ignoring-two-key-warning-signs.html"&gt;rise in colon cancer diagnoses in young people.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US has the sixth highest rate of all early-onset cancers in the world, with 87 cases per 100,000 people under 50, and colon cancer is among the fastest rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CANCER-CAUSING COOKWARE: Hot dogs and other highly processed meats are a no-go, as are non-stick pans and black plastic utensils &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnoses among people under 50 years old, which are classified as early-onset, are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old from 2010 to 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-stick pans and plastic utensils were also on Dr Kang's list of no's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These contain PFAS to form their smooth coating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of thousands of substances known as forever chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are microscopic compounds that take thousands of years to break down in the environment or human body, hence their nickname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they buildup in the body, they can disrupt hormone production and lead to issues like fertility and early menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US has the sixth highest rate of all early-onset cancers in the world, with 87 cases per 100,000 people under 50, and colon cancer is among the fastest rising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This hormone imbalance could increase the risk of cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer, which can form due to influxes of estrogen and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kang said: 'We use only stainless steel and cast iron pots and pans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Wooden spatulas and spoons.

&lt;p&gt;A 50-year-old mystery involving a missing molecular marker from a pregnant woman’s blood sample has led to the identification of a&lt;strong&gt; new blood group system&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers from the &lt;strong&gt;National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant&lt;/strong&gt; in the UK and institutions in &lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt; have described the MAL blood group system, a significant breakthrough in hematology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Uncovering the Mal Blood Group&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1972, medical professionals identified a striking anomaly when a pregnant woman’s blood lacked the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj antigen&lt;/strong&gt;, a marker found on the red blood cells of over 99.9% of people. This discovery prompted years of study and culminated in the formal recognition of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL blood group system&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Louise Tilley&lt;/strong&gt; of the NHS and &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Tim Satchwell&lt;/strong&gt; from the University of the West of England, detailed their findings in a research paper published in September. Dr. Tilley noted, “It represents a huge achievement, and the culmination of a long team effort, to finally establish this new blood group system and be able to offer the best care to rare, but important, patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blood Group Systems and Human Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood groups are determined by specific proteins and sugars coating red blood cells, with the &lt;strong&gt;ABO system&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rh factor&lt;/strong&gt; being the most widely recognized. These markers help the body identify its cells and distinguish them from potential threats. Mismatches in these markers during blood transfusions can trigger severe immune responses, even death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the MAL blood group is rare, its identification highlights the diversity of blood group systems and their medical significance. Most blood groups were discovered in the early 20th century, but rare systems like &lt;strong&gt;Er (described in 2022)&lt;/strong&gt; and MAL emphasize the ongoing nature of hematological research.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Challenges in Identifying the Mal Blood Group&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MAL protein, which anchors the AnWj antigen, plays a key role in maintaining cell membrane stability and facilitating transport. However, its small size and rarity made it difficult to study. Researchers faced additional challenges due to the limited number of cases available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Key findings from the study include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance vs. Suppression:&lt;/strong&gt; Most AnWj-negative cases result from mutations in both copies of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL gene&lt;/strong&gt;, but the researchers identified some cases where blood disorders suppressed the antigen instead.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The AnWj antigen does not appear in newborns but develops shortly after birth, hinting at its role in cellular development and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm their hypothesis, the team inserted a functioning MAL gene into AnWj-negative blood cells, restoring the missing antigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Patient Care&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the MAL blood group system allows for more precise blood typing and diagnostics. Doctors can now test for the genetic markers behind the MAL mutation to determine whether a patient’s AnWj-negative status is inherited or linked to another condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The research also revealed that no diseases or abnormalities were associated with the AnWj-negative status in their subjects, emphasizing the blood group’s rarity and complexity. As more information comes to light, the study of blood groups like MAL could provide further breakthroughs in personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ketamine, an anesthetic used to alleviate LID, was found to restore the motor cortex’s ability to regulate movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awae386/7908457?login=false"&gt;Decoupling of motor cortex to movement in Parkinson’s dyskinesia rescued by sub-anaesthetic ketamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/levodopa/"&gt;Levodopa&lt;/a&gt; is a standard treatment to manage Parkinson’s &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as stiffness and slow movements. But prolonged use of levodopa can lead to LID, which is characterized by abnormal, involuntary muscle contractions and movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing view is that these uncontrollable movements are generated from the motor cortex. The study’s results showed a more indirect link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;80 billion neurons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Arizona recorded the activity from thousands of neurons in the motor cortexes of rats, hoping to shed light on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are about 80 billion neurons in the brain, and they hardly shut up at any point,” Abhilasha Vishwanath, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona and the study’s first author, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069416"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;. “So, there are a lot of interactions between these cells that are ongoing all the time,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the activity, or firing, of these neurons had little correlation with the aberrant movements that characterize LID. Overall, this suggested a “disconnection” of the motor cortex, rather than a direct cause of such aberrant movements, the university said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like an orchestra where the conductor goes on vacation,” said Stephen Cowen, PhD, associate professor in the university’s psychology department and the study’s lead author. “Without the motor cortex properly coordinating movement, downstream neural circuits are left to spontaneously generate these problematic movements on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also unveiled the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of ketamine. They found that ketamine, when given at sub-anesthetic doses, may assist in interrupting the abnormal repetitive electrical activity in the brain associated with dyskinesia, potentially enabling the motor cortex to regain better control over movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Cowen, ketamine works in two ways. First, it disrupts the abnormal electrical patterns associated with dyskinesia. Then, in the hours or days that follow, it initiates slower processes that promote long-lasting changes in brain cell connectivity and activity, a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. This neuroplasticity allows neurons to form new connections and reinforce existing ones, extending ketamine’s impact beyond its immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single dose of ketamine can yield benefits that persist for several months, according to Vishwanath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university said the findings strengthen the potential therapeutic potential of ketamine. &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/ketamine-eases-levodopa-induced-dyskinesia-phase-2-study/"&gt;Early, promising data&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04912115"&gt;Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04912115)&lt;/a&gt; showed that a single dose of low-dose ketamine infusion eased levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease for several weeks. Low-dose ketamine was well tolerated, and side effects were mild or moderate. No serious side effects were reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Phase 2 trial is ongoing at the University of Arizona, where researchers are also testing low doses of ketamine in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine dosing could be optimized to maintain therapeutic benefits while minimizing side effects, Cowen said. The study’s insights into the role of the motor cortex in dyskinesia may also pave the way for entirely new treatment strategies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By understanding the basic neurobiology underlying how ketamine helps these dyskinetic individuals, we might be able to better treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the future,” Cowen said.&lt;/p&gt;

The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;&lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/07/d3fa7d7e-6cf0-42f4-844f-c462dcff31ac/thumbnail/620x413/07a70852b86145a85861e943cf7d1674/india-hmpv-2192262335.jpg?v=6ffea931a1e284729a23a55e2e39c4e9#" alt="Health Ministry Confirms Seven Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) Cases In India " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/07/d3fa7d7e-6cf0-42f4-844f-c462dcff31ac/thumbnail/620x413/07a70852b86145a85861e943cf7d1674/india-hmpv-2192262335.jpg?v=6ffea931a1e284729a23a55e2e39c4e9 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/07/d3fa7d7e-6cf0-42f4-844f-c462dcff31ac/thumbnail/1240x826/6b80a86f46d858ff7fa149a4e105b4a3/india-hmpv-2192262335.jpg?v=6ffea931a1e284729a23a55e2e39c4e9 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV infections are &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hmpv-virus-china-symptoms-human-metapneumovirus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reportedly surging in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity," she said, adding that the virus was fairly stable, unlike the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; virus that mutates often, making it harder to fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years," Indian Health Minister J. P. Nadda said Monday. "The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was "closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry also said the HMPV infections were "no cause of concern," as there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses detected in the country, and it noted that India was well prepared for any surge should it occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own," the ministry said in a &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2090780" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has declared a "critical incident" due to "exceptionally high demand" on services and urged people to only go to A&amp;amp;E in a genuine medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The hospital said it was "extremely busy" amid a rising number of patients with flu and other respiratory conditions, prompting Liverpool Riverside Labour MP Kim Johnson to call on the government to immediately come up with a plan to increase NHS funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Critical incidents have also been declared in the East Midlands, Devon, Cornwall and Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

general hospitals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said emergency measures had been put in place which would allow managers to call for extra help and to make changes to ensure patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;He said the critical incident had been declared because of "exceptionally high demands on our emergency department, especially with flu and respiratory illnesses, and the number of patients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The decision had been taken "to support the safe care and treatment of our patients, which is our absolute priority", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The trust said managers were working with partners to ensure that those who are medically fit can leave hospital safely and at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

patients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Non-emergency patients are urged to instead use other services, such as a GP, a local pharmacy or walk-in centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We have seen an increasing number of people with flu and respiratory illnesses in our emergency departments in recent weeks," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For people who do go to the emergency department, they asked patients and visitors to follow additional infection control measures to help curb the spread of flu and norovirus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"This includes practising good hand hygiene, only visiting the areas they need to in our hospitals and wearing masks in clinical areas if asked to do so," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Dr Jim

data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Dr Jim Gardner, chief medical director, said some patients were on trolleys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

in the greatest medical need were still be seen first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;He added that patients should continue to attend appointments unless they had been informed otherwise by the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;'Life-threatening

facing our NHS, particularly the ongoing staffing and capacity crises".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;She said: "Labour must immediately implement a comprehensive plan to increase NHS funding, recruit and retain healthcare professionals, and invest in social care to facilitate timely patient discharges across our hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Our goal must be to ensure that hospitals like Royal Liverpool are equipped to provide the high-quality care that patients deserve, without the life-threatening delays they are currently facing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Johnson pointed out that Liverpool Riverside was "the most deprived constituency in England" and that poverty remained a significant driver of health inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Tackling poverty at its root is essential to creating better health opportunities, reducing the strain on A&amp;amp;E services, and improving lives across Liverpool," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;She thanked NHS staff for their dedication "under immense pressure at these difficult times", adding "Labour must support them by rebuilding a sustainable and resilient health service for all, from cradle to grave".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Elsewhere in Merseyside, Arrowe Park in Wirral declared a critical incident on Saturday but that was stood down on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And Whiston Hospital in Prescot said it had declared Opel 4 - the highest level on the system the NHS uses to grade demand, indicating that a hospital is "unable to deliver comprehensive care" and patient safety is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:39:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

deficiency may be why you’re so tired – a nutritional neuroscientist explains how to kickstart your energy by getting essential nutrients in a well-rounded diet, along with more sleep and exercise -

    &lt;p&gt;Feeling drained and lethargic is common: A 2022 national survey found that 13.5% of U.S. adults said they &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7245a7.htm"&gt;felt “very tired” or “exhausted&lt;/a&gt;” most days or every day over a three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women ages 18 to 44 had the highest rate of fatigue – just over 20%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being tired is linked to something deeper than just overwork or a sign of the times. I’m a &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/transdisciplinary-areas-of-excellence/sustainable-communities/about/profile.html?id=lina"&gt;registered dietitian and nutritional neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt;. My research, along with the work of others in the field, shows that your diet and lifestyle choices may contribute to your struggles. These two factors are closely interconnected and could be the key to understanding what’s holding you back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, not getting enough of three essential nutrients – &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; – is linked to low energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 40% of adult Americans &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2010.12.001"&gt;are deficient in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. Low levels are linked to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency"&gt;fatigue, bone pain, muscle weakness, mood disorders and cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"&gt;Foods high in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; include fatty fish like salmon, sardines, freshwater rainbow trout, fortified dairy products and egg yolks. Among the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13114144"&gt;sources for vegetarians and vegans&lt;/a&gt; are fortified plant-based milks and cereals and some kinds of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pdf/factsheets/vitamind-consumer.pdf"&gt;recommended daily amount of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is 400 international units, or IU, for infants up to 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70 and 800 IU for people over 70. Just over 5 ounces (150 grams) of sockeye salmon fillet has about 800 IU of vitamin D. If you are low in a vitamin, your doctor may prescribe you a higher dose than the recommended daily amount to elevate your blood levels to normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Shrimp, organ meats, milk, eggs and fortified nutritional yeast are foods high in vitamin B12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20% of Americans have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.26947A"&gt;inadequate vitamin B12 levels&lt;/a&gt;, which can impair energy production and lead to anemia, resulting in fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low levels of B12 are notably higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jppr.1897"&gt;in older people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;pregnant and lactating women&lt;/a&gt;, people with gastrointestinal disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.ibdrelief.com/learn/complications-of-ibd/vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-in-ibd/vitamin-b12-and-ibd#"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, those who &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-b12/art-20363663"&gt;take certain medications&lt;/a&gt; like proton-pump inhibitors, and people with &lt;a href="https://ranimd.com/articles/does-drinking-alcohol-affect-vitamin-b12-levels#"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because vitamin B12 is primarily found in meat, fish, dairy and eggs, vegetarians and vegans should consider taking a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;vitamin B12 supplement&lt;/a&gt;. The recommended daily amount for anyone ages 4 and older is 2.4 micrograms, about what’s found in 3 ounces of tuna or Atlantic salmon. Pregnant and breastfeeding women &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/vitamin-b12-cobalamin"&gt;require slightly more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking B12 supplements can be as effective as getting the vitamin from food – and taking the supplement with food &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-getting-enough-b12#:%7E"&gt;may enhance its absorption&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here’s a note on supplements in general: While they can be beneficial, they shouldn’t replace whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are supplements &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements"&gt;less strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration compared to prescription and over-the-counter drugs&lt;/a&gt;, making their potency uncertain, but real food also provides a complex array of nutrients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1279925"&gt;that work in a synergistic way&lt;/a&gt;. Many supplements on the market boast multiple servings of vegetables, but nothing beats the actual food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/629616/original/file-20241103-15-is4mn6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Along with salmon and sardines, the many vegan sources for omega-3 fatty acids include pecans, almonds and pumpkin seeds.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/food-with-high-content-of-omega-3-fats-royalty-free-image/1301412050?phrase=foods+high+in+omega+3+fatty+acids&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;fcafotodigital/E+ via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 87% of adults ages 40 to 59, and about 80% of those 60 and older, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db399-H.pdf"&gt;don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; to meet dietary recommendations. Neither do &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/prenatal-supplements-largely-lack-the-recommended-amount-of-omega-3-fatty-acids-to-help-prevent-preterm-birth-new-research-244231"&gt;many pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for brain health, and a deficiency can lead to higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10060663"&gt;anxiety and depression levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0000000000000862"&gt;impaired cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Taken together, these deficiencies can add to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best sources of omega-3 fatty acids &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/#"&gt;are fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re strictly vegan, flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts can be great alternatives. However, it’s worth noting the omega-3s in fish are absorbed better in the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.596292"&gt;than plant sources&lt;/a&gt; – and that determines how efficiently the body can use the omega-3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, whole flaxseed has a tough outer shell, which makes it more difficult to digest and absorb its nutrients. But ground flaxseed has been broken down, making the omega-3s and other nutrients &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/flaxseed/faq-20058354#"&gt;more available for absorption&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The role of alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although alcohol may provide a sense of relaxation in the moment, it actually &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/alcohol-and-fatigue"&gt;contributes to fatigue&lt;/a&gt; after the buzz wears off. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-does-drinking-alcohol-do-to-your-body.h00-159696756.html"&gt;is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;; it forces your body to prioritize its metabolism over that of nutrients, which means the body reduces the use of carbohydrates and fat for energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602002"&gt;reduces the absorption of B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, which consequently affects energy production. The bottom line: If you drink alcohol, ultimately you will feel tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/629618/original/file-20241103-15-pa1xpn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Alcohol is a depressant, and it will deplete your energy.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/young-woman-sitting-in-the-pub-with-beer-glass-royalty-free-image/2031818179?phrase=alcohol+use+disorder&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Dmytro Betsenko/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diet isn’t everything. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.116-a160"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/light-exercise-can-yield-significant-cognitive-benefits-new-research-shows-243559"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-resilience-a-psychologist-explains-the-main-ingredients-that-help-people-manage-stress-218323"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are all critical factors for reducing fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;can make vitamin D from sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t need a lot. A few minutes up to a half hour of sun exposure can help most people get what they need. The amount of time can vary depending on where you live, how much clothing you wear and what time of year you get the exposure. You’ll reach your vitamin D daily quota much faster on a sunny day during the summer than a cloudy day in winter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it may sound counterintuitive, but the more you exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389"&gt;the more energy you will produce&lt;/a&gt;; working out doesn’t drain you. Instead, it boosts energy, along with mood, by improving blood flow and helping to release endorphins, which are hormones produced by the body to relieve pain or stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without exercise, the human body becomes less efficient at producing energy, which leads to lethargy. Coupled with erratic blood sugar levels – often caused by &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/worried-about-the-health-effects-of-the-sugar-in-your-breakfast-cereal-little-has-changed-since-the-days-of-unfrosted-the-pop-tarts-movie-233633"&gt;diets high in refined sugars&lt;/a&gt; and low in nutrients – these energy dips and spikes can leave you feeling irritable and drained.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:%7E"&gt;150 minutes of moderate exercise each week&lt;/a&gt; through activities like brisk walking, cycling, swimming and strength training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slsci.2014.11.001"&gt;makes things even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Not getting enough rest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;disrupts the body’s natural recovery processes&lt;/a&gt; and will leave you with diminished energy and focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you should try to get &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2015.10.004"&gt;seven to nine hours of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. For some people &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/better-sleep-for-kids-starts-with-better-sleep-for-parents-especially-after-holiday-disruptions-to-routines-196110"&gt;this is not easy&lt;/a&gt;; creating a calming bedtime routine helps, and limiting screen time is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid phones, computers and other screens for at least 30 to 60 minutes before bed. The blue light emitted from screens can interfere with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;your body’s production of melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Conversely, activities like reading, meditation or gentle stretching help signal to your body that it’s time to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there are things you can do about your fatigue. Smart choices help optimize mood, energy levels and overall health, and reduce the surges of sluggishness you feel throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: Your diet and lifestyle can make all the difference between being alert or wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

While a sea of spandex-clad bodies moved balletically around me, I collapsed on my mat in child’s pose. Sweat dripped from my brow. The heater across the room hissed and blasted another gust of scorching air into the small, sealed studio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I tried to catch my breath, the 20-something yoga instructor yelled over the electropop playlist,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“If you want to experience growth, you need to do more!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but feel like she was speaking directly to me, and so, I mustered my last bit of energy. But when I rose to join the class in warrior two, the heat inside my chest exploded into flames. I was having a massive hot flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not finish that yoga class. Instead, I rolled up my mat and fled the studio for the air-conditioned bathroom where I stuck my head under the ice-cold faucet. It took an hour for my body to return to a state of homeostasis, and I felt exhausted and dehydrated for days, no matter how many electrolytes I consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I’m not sure what possessed me to attend hot yoga in the first place.

I assumed it was something left over from nursing my then 18-month-old son, however, two years prior, I lost my mother to a fast-moving Chondrosarcoma and painstakingly learned that with cancer &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-cancer-early-diagnosis" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="early detection is everything" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-cancer-early-diagnosis" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;early detection is everything&lt;/a&gt;. As I pushed down on the mass under my skin, I made a mental note to follow up with my primary care doctor, &lt;em&gt;just in case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her two sons, Max and Freddie, in September 2017, one month before her diagnosis.

Two months later, I underwent a unilateral mastectomy and post-op began a 10-year adjuvant treatment: a daily medication, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/letrozole-oral-route/description/drg-20067579" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Letrozole" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/letrozole-oral-route/description/drg-20067579" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Letrozole&lt;/a&gt;, to wipe out all the estrogen in my body, and quarterly &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/leuprolide-intradermal-route-intramuscular-route-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20067038" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lupron" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/leuprolide-intradermal-route-intramuscular-route-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20067038" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Lupron&lt;/a&gt; injections to shut down my ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two treatments will push you into menopause,” my oncologist informed me, as if he was explaining a simple math equation. “You may or may not experience symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“OK,” I responded. At the time, I knew so little about menopause I didn’t have any follow-up questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quickly changed. Within a matter of weeks, an onslaught of symptoms hit me with a brute force. I suffered insomnia and night sweats, muscle and body aches, brain fog, mood swings, fatigue and hot flashes. I also had symptoms of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38281168/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38281168/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause&lt;/a&gt; (GSM), which caused frequent urinary tract infections and vaginal dryness that disrupted my sex life. At 37 years old, I was Benjamin Button in reverse — I’d aged 20 years in only two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt as though the cancer medications had hijacked my body and left me marooned in an unknown land — menopause. I woke every night drenched in cold sweat, as if someone poured a glass of water over my head. My joints cracked like an old wooden floorboard whenever I stood up. My mood was all over the place, and I became short-tempered with my two young children. I was confused about my symptoms, and I felt isolated in my experience. I couldn’t talk to my close friends about what I was going through because nobody else in my peer group had been through it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you tried any homeopathic remedies?” my primary care doctor asked me one day. I was back on her examination table bemoaning my menopausal symptoms. “A few supplements and vitamins might help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, I went home and googled “menopause cure.” I poured over the vast selection of expensive organic remedies — supplements, vitamins, treatments — that popped up on my screen. I quickly ordered a pharmaceutical grade Vitamin D3 supplement and women’s daily vitamin, both of which helped to somewhat alleviate my chronic aches and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, I noticed that my targeted algorithms had adjusted, and an array of ads took over my Instagram feed, touting everything from menopause face serums and shampoos to herbal teas. At first, I found it impossible to resist the beautifully packaged products — the promise that a green juice or body oil might restore my stolen youth. I purchased an expensive Aegean sea scrub to combat my dry skin, and an overpriced “menopause protein powder.” And while none of these products really worked, there always seemed to be another one I could buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author celebrated her 44th birthday with her niece and two children last July.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, menopause has become an industry projected to be worth &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/women-s-health-on-tiktok-firms-patients-look-to-app-for-menopause-awareness" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="$24.4 billion by 2030" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/women-s-health-on-tiktok-firms-patients-look-to-app-for-menopause-awareness" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;$24.4 billion by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.

In my effort to turn back the clock, I’d fallen prey to the falsity that aging is shameful, and worse, it’s somehow magically avoidable — if only we buy and apply the right face serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve learned that menopause isn’t just about hot flashes and dry skin, it’s also about the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="increased risk for serious medical conditions" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67632b0de4b02d22ce0994eb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;increased risk for serious medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;, like dementia and osteoporosis. I’ve learned that taking proper care of my body and mind means investing in my future health. For instance, I’ve adjusted my exercise routines to focus on bone strength and mobility rather than weight loss. I’ve also learned that this next stage of life is about coming to terms with shifting relationships — marriages, friendships and family — and empty nesting. It’s about reexamining value systems and reprioritizing what’s important in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s been about redefining my expectations around beauty and my sense of self-worth, as well as letting go of the need to measure up to anyone else’s standards but my own. I’ve come to understand that with aging comes deeper wisdom and better discernment. As I get older, I’ve learned that I don’t need to do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; to experience growth and change, I can just do things &lt;em&gt;differently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was first diagnosed with cancer, I became acutely aware that time is the most precious commodity. During those first few days, while I waited for my biopsy results, I stayed awake at night consumed with fear and anxiety. I wanted to live to see my two sons grow up. I wanted to experience life as a grandmother. In other words, I desperately wanted to survive cancer and grow older. But when my hormone treatment slammed me into induced menopause, it felt like what was left of my youth was taken from me. I quickly lost sight of what was important: I was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, when I look in the mirror, I see someone who has survived cancer and the intense grief of losing a parent. Cancer and sudden induced menopause gave me the opportunity to prematurely confront my own mortality and decide what’s important to me: my family, my health, my friends, my career. It helped me to embrace the idea that aging isn’t something that needs to be fixed. There isn’t a cure for menopause. It’s just another part of life. I’m thankful that I learned this lesson while I’m still young-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, Alex, in summer 2024.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went to that hellfire hot yoga class at the behest of my friend. I remember thinking that if I could just finish the class, it would mean that I was back to my old self — my pre-cancer self. But maybe we don’t have to shoulder some great burden to feel young again. Sometimes, I still feel like I’m 25 years old. Other days, I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. On those days, I try to slow down and practice self-compassion, something I struggled with before surviving breast cancer. I remind myself that self-love means I don’t always have to do the full expression of the pose. Sometimes it’s enough to show up, sit on your mat, and breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Need Your Support&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other news outlets have retreated behind paywalls.

While we advocate for not labelling our eating habits or following too many strict rules – instead choosing the foods, meals and timings that best suit our circumstances and preferences – for some, setting out a proper plan is the best way to manage their nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;With that in mind, &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2025-01-03/u-s-news-releases-the-2025-edition-of-best-diets" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2025-01-03/u-s-news-releases-the-2025-edition-of-best-diets" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;, the global authority in health rankings and consumer advice, has released its guide to the best diets to try this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: in this context "diet" simply refers to the foods we eat, rather than a weight-loss-specific programme. These "best overall diets" are designed to be good for everyone, promoting general health and are not necessarily geared towards weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;With that in mind, let's start at the top spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;It might not be too surprising that the &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a759555/the-mediterranean-diet-could-fight-depression/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a759555/the-mediterranean-diet-could-fight-depression/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean diet" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; tops the charts. It's long been a favourite way of eating for experts thanks to the abundance of diversity and plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;The experts rated this diet the best as it is nonrestrictive, meaning people find it easy to follow, sustainable for the long term and adaptable to any cuisine or lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt; They also say numerous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9317652/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9317652/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that it reduces the risk of certain chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, while promoting longevity and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;There isn't a single type of Mediterranean diet as people throughout this region all eat differently, however most eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, seafood, poultry, beans and nuts, with a focus on extra virgin olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;In second place comes the lesser-known Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Promoted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, it's designed to protect heart health and reduce the risk of high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;It does this by &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/food-drink/g61851593/high-fibre-foods/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/food-drink/g61851593/high-fibre-foods/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="increasing fibre" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;increasing fibre&lt;/a&gt; and heart-healthy minerals, including calcium, potassium and magnesium, while decreasing the amount of sodium and unhealthy fats that you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;Taking the bronze award for the healthiest meal is the &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a38184952/flexitarian-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a38184952/flexitarian-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="flexitarian diet" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;flexitarian diet&lt;/a&gt;. On this meal plan, you reduce the amount of meat, eating a largely vegetarian or plant-based diet, and enjoying steaks, chicken and fish occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;To keep this healthy, your flexitarian diet needs to be whole food focused. 'Follow the general guidelines of a vegetarian diet, while allowing the occasional meat dish,'  say the experts at U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report. 'Befriend tofu, beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds and eggs; they’ll provide the bulk of your daily protein. Don’t overconsume animal products, processed foods and foods high in saturated fat, sugar and sodium – even if they are labeled as “plant-based”.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;Another diet with a useful acronym, the "Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay" – we'll stick with MIND – combines two of the best-ranked diets from this list, the Mediterranean and the DASH diets, to create  a meal plan that supports your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;People who eat in this way have around 53 per cent lower risk of developing &lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/conditions/brain-disease/alzheimers" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://health.usnews.com/conditions/brain-disease/alzheimers" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s disease" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989093/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989093/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also connect the MIND diet to other positive cognitive effects. It involves eating whole grains and other vegetables daily, at least five servings of nuts a week, especially walnuts, and five-and-a-half cups of berries (around 800 grams) – preferably blueberries – per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"&gt;Lean poultry should be eaten twice a week, fish once a week and olive oil should be the only cooking fat used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="20" class="css-1xkwtv6 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;h2 id="read-next" data-node-id="21" class="body-h3 css-15argfy emevuu60"&gt;Read Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Men's Health UK</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:50:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9tcnBPYmxlLWZReldGbDhlNGVFNDQzMWZFeHZ4WnBaNHc0TEswY3J0TFFVN0lpOVRiVXFULVB2d2F6ZmFWb2Rnb0RkbWpCMXRxajBWa2dWZDBTMVFHSnpWV3dxRVBlczE5MlhxRnZGOUJrckk1ZG9vVmtGMA</guid></item><item><title>Retatrutide Produces Greatest Weight Loss - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeWZpUDJIRHdoWklONm0tN3Q0QmgwZmpaM2hSOXdxSnRDSWRZVkZtWUE3WGVZdDd2ZWFlNk1yNHhZdjNHUEJlNV9uNUlocnFvbEVVR1RrQ0ZtZUdFWWRydFN1YVhBa1BRb3Z6RkgwTkJackdheDM1T2lEUnI3cDNvRDZNNDBEeTFkX1VlMFdMMHktSWJ4NEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) finds that among glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and co-agonists on the market or still being investigated, the experimental drug retatrutide (Eli Lilly and Company) produces the greatest weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review, conducted by researchers at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, examined three commercially available medications in the class and nine that have not yet received regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy adults with overweight or obesity who did not have diabetes, the highest mean reductions in relative and absolute body weight were achieved with once-weekly triple glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist retatrutide, followed by the dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide (Eli Lilly and Company) and lastly by the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide (Novo Nordisk), according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of all the GLP-1s or co-agonist medications “led to decreased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, SBP (systolic blood pressure), and DBP (diastolic blood pressure),” wrote the authors in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01590"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All the medications had a similar safety profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find any head-to-head studies, so instead examined the results from 26 RCTs that enrolled more than 15,000 patients. Only trials with a treatment duration of at least 16 weeks were included, to ensure that patients had at least a month of a fixed dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the review found that, except for semaglutide, trials with “dual and triple agonists generally reported numerically greater mean weight losses than single GLP-1 agonists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They caution, however, against drawing conclusions about comparative efficacy, as the populations, control groups, and contexts of the various studies might not be directly comparable. All the trial enrollees also received lifestyle modification along with drug therapy or placebo, but the interventions and protocols varied across the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found that individuals on retatrutide (12 mg once-weekly injection) lost 22% of body weight from baseline after 48 weeks. Tirzepatide (15 mg once-weekly injection) recipients lost almost 18% of body weight after 72 weeks, while those on semaglutide (2.4 mg once-weekly injection) lost about 14% after 68 weeks. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide are commercially available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking liraglutide (3 mg once-daily injection), also on the market, lost up to 6% of body weight after 26 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also examined studies of investigational agents and reported that the greatest loss, aside from retatrutide, was with the dual glucagon/GLP-1 agonists survodutide (Boehringer Ingelheim; 6%-15%) and the mazdutide (Innovent Biologics; 7%-11%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orforglipron (Eli Lilly and Company), a once-daily pill, produced weight loss of 9%-15%, depending on the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that four investigational drugs did not produce as much weight loss: Beinaglutide (0.2 mg injection three times daily, 6%), efpeglenatide (4-8 mg injection once weekly, about 7%), exenatide (10 mcg injection twice daily, 5 kg change in weight), and noiiglutide (once-daily injection, 9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse events for all GLP-1s were gastrointestinal (GI), such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting. Across all agents, 60%-80% of patients taking the medications experienced a GI adverse event, although most were transient, according to the authors. A total of 6%-26% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said that no serious GI disorders, such as bowel obstruction or gastroparesis, were reported in any of the 26 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also shows that it is likely that GLP-1s would have to be used chronically to have the greatest effect, said the authors. They noted that they found that trials “with longer treatment durations demonstrate similar weight loss results to those with shorter follow-up, reinforcing the idea that continuous treatment may be required.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Tsoukas, MD, reported receiving payments or honoraria from Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly and Company, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Novo Nordisk. The study was carried out independently without any grant or other funding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alicia Ault is a Saint Petersburg, Florida-based freelance journalist whose work has appeared in many health and science publications, including Smithsonian.com.

This is because it was observed that while anyone can be affected by it, OSA is more prevalent in people who are obese or overweight. The decision was made based on the results of two clinical trials on 469 adults on whom the drug was administered for 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways-3"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obstructive Sleep Apnea is more common in those who have obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zepbound improves moderate to severe OSA by reducing body weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The drug should only be taken under doctor’s guidance as it can have certain side effects while some may be allergic to tirzepatide, the active ingredient in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSA happens when a person’s upper airway gets blocked which then causes pauses in breathing during sleep. Zepbound was found to work on moderate to severe obstructive apnea in adults with obesity, based on the results of two randomized, placebo-controlled studies on 469 individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one study involved participants using positive airway pressure or PAP (the standard treatment for OSA), the other enrolled those who were unwilling or unable to use the same. All participants received either 10 or 15 milligrams of Zepbound or placebo over a period of 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary monitoring parameter was the change in the baseline of apnea hypopnea index (AHI), which is a measurement of how many times a person stops breathing (apnea) or takes in shallow breaths (hypopnea) during sleep. At the end of 52 weeks, it was found that participants who received Zepbound showed reduced levels of apnea or hypoapnea compared to those who were administered the placebo drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-obstructive-sleep-apnea-3"&gt;What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of sleep apnea: central sleep apnea (CSA), a condition where the brain fails to stimulate breathing, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bstructive sleep apnea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (OSA), which occurs when breathing repeatedly starts and stops as throat muscles relax too much during sleep, blocking the airways. If left untreated, OSA will affect overall sleep quality which can have a host of other health implications including mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can even &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/expert-shares-5-common-sleep-apnea-symptoms-in-children-and-when-theyre-likely-to-appear" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/expert-shares-5-common-sleep-apnea-symptoms-in-children-and-when-theyre-likely-to-appear"&gt;affect children&lt;/a&gt;, certain factors place some individuals at more risk than others. Experts underline that obesity, smoking, consumption of alcohol and poor sleep habits can develop OSA. Old age or any existing deformities like enlarged tonsils or adenoids, thick neck circumference or narrow air ways can also exacerbate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AuPne8voRBQxqW6ha2LWyK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AuPne8voRBQxqW6ha2LWyK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-tirzepatide-reduce-sleep-apnea-symptoms-3"&gt;How does tirzepatide reduce sleep apnea symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Zepbound, the FDA approved prescription medicine for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10154650/" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10154650/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that it considerably improves the level of AHI in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens as it activates the two hormones secreted from the intestine: (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)), which in turn reduces appetite and fat mass in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two clinical trials also saw a decrease in the body weight of those who were given the drug, which makes it seem that the improvement in AHI and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-symptoms" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-symptoms"&gt;sleep apnea symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in those with OSA is related to weight reduction due to Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-other-obstructive-sleep-apnea-treatment-options"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other Obstructive Sleep Apnea treatment options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA prescribed drug is for obese patients so not everyone with OSA will be eligible to take the same. However, there are other standard &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-treatments" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-treatments"&gt;sleep apnea treatment options&lt;/a&gt; available which are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cpap-machines-3"&gt;CPAP machines  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines are the most common treatment for OSA. This includes a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-mask" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-mask"&gt;sleep apnea mask&lt;/a&gt; which delivers a consistent stream of pressurized air which opens up the airways and prevents any blocks. However, certain patients don't like using CPAP machines as these can prove to be quite uncomfortable during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="mouthguards-3"&gt;Mouthguards&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are a popular alternative to the CPAP machines since they're easier to use and stick with. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/what-are-mouthguards-for-sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/what-are-mouthguards-for-sleep-apnea"&gt;Sleep apnea mouthguards&lt;/a&gt; work by supporting the lower jaw and keeping the airways open. Mandibular Advancement Devices are the most commonly used mouthguards for sleep apnea. These help keep the airways open by holding the lower jaw and tongue further forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="surgery-3"&gt;Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different types of surgery administered depending on the severity of sleep apnea. This includes Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) which involves the removal of excess tissue from the throat which may be causing the airway blocks, jaw surgery or even the installation of upper airway stimulation devices underneath the clavicle to keep the airways open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="laser-therapy-3"&gt;Laser therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively new option to treat sleep apnea compared to the others. Laser therapy can be used to tighten the throat tissues to rid any obstruction of the airways. According to experts, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9813098/" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9813098/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;NightLase treatments&lt;/a&gt; are an FDA approved non-invasive option to treat mild to moderate sleep apnea issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="lifestyle-changes-3"&gt;Lifestyle changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440784/" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440784/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that obesity is one of the major lifestyle factors leading to obstructive sleep apnea. This is because overweight individuals often have excess tissues in their throats which can block the airways and result in troubled breathing during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other triggers include smoking or consumption of alcohol which can worsen any existing conditions or develop symptoms. As mentioned in the FDA approval for Zepbound, weight loss is often a primary recommendation for those struggling with both sleep apnea and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

My period — the monster that turned me from a functioning person into a whimpering, tremulous piece of Jell-O carving a spot into the couch — had, somehow, lost its power. As I understood it, I had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/04/interview-chloe-caldwell-pmdd.html"&gt;premenstrual dysphoric disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or PMDD. More than just “heavy PMS,” PMDD meant that the week before my period I suffered from a grab bag of severe mental and physical symptoms including a new, frightening one: suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmojr000f3b83z4kmxp7c@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;Now, however, things were different. My period didn’t rule my life anymore. In fact, there was little to no difference in my mood and energy no matter what time it was in my cycle. The only thing that had changed in my life was my weekly shot of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/what-to-know-about-mounjaro-zepbound.html"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmoq8000g3b83fsgl0x6a@published" data-word-count="187"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://iapmd.org/about-pmdd"&gt;International Association of Premenstrual Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, PMDD affects 5.5 percent of reproductive-age women, which translates to about 4 million women in the U.S. Misunderstood and understudied, it takes the average patient 12 years to get an &lt;a href="https://iapmd.org/press-releases/premenstrual-disorders-mckinsey-report-closing-womens-health-gap#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIAPMD's%20Global%20Survey%20of%20Premenstrual,an%20accurate%20diagnosis%20of%20PMDD."&gt;accurate diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in one study, the IAPMD found that &lt;a href="https://iapmd.org/press-releases/2022/6/13/global-study-reveals-alarming-34-of-people-with-menstrual-related-disorder-have-attempted-suicide"&gt;34 percent of sufferers had attempted suicide&lt;/a&gt; during a PMDD episode. The cause of the disorder is unclear, and it can start during any stage in someone’s reproductive life. For me, it became severe and dangerous shortly after giving birth in October 2020. When my period returned, I started to feel paralyzed with depression for about three days a month during my &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/cycle-syncing-content-influencers.html"&gt;luteal phase&lt;/a&gt;, or the time between ovulation and the start of my period. This wasn’t how I felt before I had given birth. I was a scary and strange new version of myself, one that felt listless, tired, and with an uncontrollable urge to binge food. Instead of losing any pregnancy weight, I was slowly gaining it, and soon I was the biggest I’d ever been, my prepregnancy clothes sitting in boxes in the back of my closet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmowx000h3b83dt7n1bnl@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;Six months postpartum, my mood was dark and dreary. I didn’t quite notice. I was busy with the baby. My husband suggested therapy, and my psychiatrist prescribed Wellbutrin. The drug barely made a dent. Of course, it didn’t help matters that my emotional and physical nadir coincided with a global pandemic. My initiation into motherhood was lonely. I was the primary caretaker for our daughter, as my husband worked full time as a Legal Aid attorney and pounded the pavement for his City Council campaign during nights and weekends. In those months before the vaccine, my only “friend” who I’d see regularly was Tyra Banks when I watched &lt;em&gt;America’s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt;: the complete series on Hulu, and she was no friend to women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmoy9000i3b83zkrms0t2@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;Maybe this was just what postpartum life felt like, I thought. I should be grateful to have a child at all. It was a long road to get there, marked by miscarriage and an accompanying cancer scare. Maybe I was just embodying that &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quote, “Women are born with pain built in.” I hid from my moods as much as I could, something I’ve practiced my whole life as an Irish Catholic from Boston. I was also dealing with sleep apnea, made worse by weight gain, which combined with the typical late-night infant wake-ups was destroying my sleep. Dull and sapped, lacking the enthusiasm and optimism that felt inherent to my personality, I was an imitation of myself, going through the motions. Months passed, which turned to years, and suddenly my newborn daughter was a potty-trained, &lt;em&gt;Bluey&lt;/em&gt;-loving toddler. Stuck in survival mode, I considered myself simply depressed. I didn’t have the energy to consider alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmp06000j3b83oautmf7h@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;In early 2023, I texted a friend asking if this was a normal way to feel when you start weaning off breastfeeding. She punctured through my gloom with an illuminating “No, and this is worrying.” It was the reality check I needed. I started attending postpartum groups and individual therapy over Zoom. Sitting in front of a secondhand pink crib, talking into the glowing maw of my MacBook, is when my therapists first brought up the idea that I very likely had PMDD as well as C-PTSD related to that earlier miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpbc000k3b83482xh1vr@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Treating PMDD is complex and uncertain: Once a diagnosis is made — based on symptoms both emotional (such as mood swings, depression, and suicidal ideation) and physical (such as marked changed in appetite or sleeping patterns, breast tenderness, and weight gain) — treatments range from SSRIs to hysterectomy. My psychiatrist recommended I take Zoloft for the luteal week before my period; given my lackluster experience on Wellbutrin, I was skeptical that taking another anti-depressant would help. My therapists didn’t have many other suggestions for how to help — nothing about lifestyle changes, weight loss, or surgery. The vagueness bothered me. I found myself scrolling through Reddit boards, where thousands of sufferers unsatisfied with their doctors’ answers crowdsourced solutions such as taking antihistamines like Benadryl or microdosing psychedelics for relief.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpdk000l3b837x3f1q1p@published" data-word-count="190"&gt;Answered prayers arrive in funny forms and, for me, finding PMDD salvation started with a bad heart scan. In January 2023, I paid a visit to my general practitioner for my first physical since the pandemic. My doctor looked at my apparently abnormal EKG reading and said, bluntly, “Did you have a heart attack?” It was a shocking thing to hear. My maternal grandma had died from a heart attack in her 50s, leaving my mom motherless at 17. My cholesterol was high, and my doctor prescribed a statin. Straightforward and to the point, she told me to lose weight. I said I eat mostly vegetarian and exercised and I wasn’t sure what I could do. I had a dim awareness of a tendency to binge during my period, but I didn’t see that as the source of my weight gain, just something that led to an empty pretzel bag hidden in the trash.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;On my husband’s suggestion, I followed up my worrisome physical with a visit to an endocrinologist. The blood work for that appointment had me at a pre-diabetic A1C. She suggested a GLP-1 drug for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpfl000m3b83u53eap5x@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;At first, I resented the doctor’s suggestion. I told myself that I was okay with my body, resigned to a permanent state of trying to lose weight, vaguely, at some point, and feeling guilty over my binges. But it didn’t take long to decide that — considering my heart, the statins, my grandmother — if a GLP-1 had the potential to make me healthier, then I had to give it a shot. My doctor prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/weight-loss-ozempic.html"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, but I couldn’t find it in stock anywhere. Same with Wegovy. But months later, Zepbound came on the market and I was first on line.&lt;/p&gt;

My formerly uncontrollable urges to snack right before my period — the kind where honey-mustard pretzels would tremble in my presence — had become nonexistent. I ate three square meals a day. I did strength workouts on my Peloton app. Never much of a drinker, save a social glass of wine with dinner, I completely stopped. My therapy appointments mellowed out, too, even in the historically wretched week leading up to my period. And I was more focused: Instead of scrolling on my phone at the playground while I pushed my daughter on the swing, lost in depressing thoughts, I noticed myself noticing how she navigates the playground, moving from the swing to big imaginary games about the princesses from &lt;em&gt;Frozen,&lt;/em&gt; a movie she’s never seen. I was a little more present, and I had a little more energy. I was, finally, starting to feel like a good mother and a fully realized person too, less of a gremlin killing time in between binges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpot000p3b83qmy01y9h@published" data-word-count="177"&gt;I missed finding pleasure in food, like the delight of indulging in a great meal at a restaurant. But I was gaining alternate delights. Some of them were shallow and conditional. I fit in new sizes in my clothes. I looked happier and more confident. I felt like I could go out in the world and people would listen to me. There was some joy that came from that, even if I knew, intellectually, that it was a Pyrrhic victory, further proof that we live in a society that prioritizes and is kinder to smaller bodies. Then there were the substantial, important results at my next physical, like an A1C that wasn’t prediabetic and an improved cholesterol reading. Emotionally, I felt calmer, but it felt strange for happiness to become something like a permanent state of being, a smooth way to go through the world. I had gotten so used to the ups and downs of being a sensitive person in the world — the roller coaster of euphoria and despair — that I almost missed them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpsv000q3b8373fx97m1@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;The transformation felt so much bigger than weight loss. Was it possible that Zepbound was influencing how my brain responded to my menstrual cycle? I began searching PMDD Facebook groups to see if anyone else was having a similar experience. There’d be the rare post that would sound just like me, someone who started taking one of these drugs and found their symptoms lessened, what one such poster called a “refreshingly positive side effect.” But others would say that trying a GLP-1 made their depression, their PMDD, or their suicidality worse. Reddit boards featured similar extremes, as tends to be the case with Doctor Internet: people detailing why something they did was the best or worst thing ever with no recounting of the mundane experiences in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpud000r3b83q9qrtjyg@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;My therapist, my medication-management doctor, and my husband all affirmed that my mood was clearly brighter and happier. But I still didn’t really understand why Zepbound had seemingly affected my PMDD. My best friend, a doctor, and her husband, a psychiatrist, said that my experiences with Zepbound and PMDD were fascinating, but the drugs were too new to be hearing anything official to know why, exactly, I was being affected in this way. I wanted to figure out what was going on with my body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpvr000s3b832v989dhy@published" data-word-count="197"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt;, I hoped, &lt;em&gt;a PMDD expert would know more. &lt;/em&gt;I turned to Sandi MacDonald, the co-founder and executive director of the International Association of Premenstrual Disorders. For MacDonald, PMDD is best described as a sensitivity to hormone fluctuations: “Patients have that sensitivity where they just can’t handle it, their bodies can’t handle the rise and fall of the hormones and so their bodies and brains are reacting to it. That’s what makes PMDD so dramatic.” When MacDonald first started her group in 2013, a Google search would yield three results. These days, it’s 100,000. Anecdotally, MacDonald was hearing that PMDD patients taking Ozempic and Wegovy have been reporting muted symptoms with their PMDD. But it’s hard to figure out an explanation for how GLP-1’s could be affecting PMDD sufferers when the problem at hand is already under-defined. For example, I had read it theorized that GABA (the neurotransmitter that helps regulate your mood) signaling may &lt;a href="https://www.menopausespecialists.com/post/the-role-of-gaba-in-pmdd#:~:text=Research%20suggests%20that%20changes%20in,to%20regulate%20mood%20and%20anxiety."&gt;play a role&lt;/a&gt; in PMDD. Separately, researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/march/newly-discovered-brain-response-to-obesity-drug-may-inform-future-treatments"&gt;found GLP-1 receptors located on GABA neurons&lt;/a&gt;. Could there be some connection made between those two points that helps explain my personal experience? We simply don’t know enough about how PMDD works to say.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5lcmpx3000t3b83jh7wjvof@published" data-word-count="188"&gt;I also called up Dr. Karolina P. Skibicka, neuroscientist and associate professor at Penn State and professor of molecular medicine at Gothenburg University. She said that it’s too soon to know whether there is a connection between GLP-1 drugs and hormonal disorders like PMDD but affirmed that it’s a question that she and other scientists are trying to answer. Skibicka has been studying GLP-1 drugs for almost two decades and authored the first paper concluding that GLP-1’s affect the brain’s reward circuitry and appear to have the potential to reduce cravings from things other than food, such as alcohol. Her lab and others have shown that the GLP-1 hormone interacts with estrogen, which might explain why women tend to lose more weight on the drugs than men. Now, she’s interested in learning how these drugs affect emotionality in women. Specifically, she’s been studying how these drugs affect anxiety and depression “separate from obesity” and whether these drugs can affect the brain’s mesolimbic dopamine system. But it won’t be a simple question to answer, in part because of (you guessed it) the history of gender bias in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

Historically, she continued, most neuroscience studies have used male rats. This has only started to change recently, beginning around 2016, when the National Institute for Health mandated that all new grants need a statement about how they will be using male and female species in their research. As a result, “we are only a decade into learning about neurochemical differences between men and women regarding things like food intake.” And of course, there is not a lot of funding for PMDD research, which Skibicka described as “snuck” into grant proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only do I not know exactly what’s happening with my body, but leading experts don’t either — and we could be many years away from beginning to figure it out. I still don’t know if there’s a cure for PMDD, but with my symptoms lessened, I’m at least feeling some hope, and hope is something you can hold onto in the dark. I feel like a different person now, maybe closer to who I’m supposed to be. Life doesn’t have to feel at its absolute grim nadir forever. It’s not an answer to my question, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s one protein that stands out as a true cholesterol-lowering powerhouse, and that’s the humble walnut. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are so beneficial that research has found that eating 1 to 2 ounces of these tasty nuts daily for two years lowered total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by roughly 4%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But why is it so important to maintain healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; levels in the first place? “High levels of [harmful] LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wendybazilian.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and host of the 1,000 Waking Minutes podcast.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, “HDL, [the] so called ‘good’ cholesterol, helps clear excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. I liken it to the garbage trucks circulating around and bringing it back for disposal, breakdown [and] elimination from the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand why walnuts are such a standout in the fight against high cholesterol, we spoke with Bazilian and registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, for their expert take on why this nutrient-packed food is the best protein to lower cholesterol. Read on to learn what makes walnuts uniquely suited for heart health and how incorporating them into your diet may lower your cholesterol numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walnuts-can-improve-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walnuts Can Improve Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, studies have shown that nuts—including walnuts—may promote healthy cholesterol levels. It all started back in 1993, says Bazilian, when a landmark study from Loma Linda University put nuts, and walnuts in particular, on the map, highlighting their nutritional attributes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Since that time, literally hundreds of studies have expanded and confirmed a wide variety of health benefits of nuts,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what makes walnuts such a noteworthy addition to a cholesterol-lowering diet? As it turns out, it’s not one or two nutrients, says Bazilian. It’s their entire nutritional package. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some unique ways these nutrient-packed nuts can improve cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Surprising Source of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, nuts may not be the first food that comes to mind. However, with 2 grams of fiber per ounce (about 14 walnut halves), walnuts are a tasty way to add more roughage to your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And that can help with cholesterol management and reduction, says Brazilian. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have linked walnut consumption to a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. And their fiber may be one reason.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How, exactly, does fiber do this? “The fiber in walnuts helps reduce cholesterol levels by binding to cholesterol in the digestive system and aiding in its excretion,” says DeVito. “This in turn, reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Loaded with Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are packed with not one but two types of heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats. The first is alpha-linoleic acid. This polyunsaturated fat plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by helping remove LDL cholesterol from the body. It does this by activating our cells’ LDL receptors, encouraging them to gobble up and clear away LDL particles from the bloodstream. If that weren’t enough, walnuts are an excellent source of heart-healthy alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fat&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to favorably regulate LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in adults and children.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Antioxidants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These tasty nuts are rich in polyphenols, good-for-you plant compounds linked to better heart health. Polyphenols are antioxidants that work to neutralize harmful free radicals, reducing oxidative stress that can damage cells and tissues. By combating inflammation, a key driver of many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, polyphenols help promote better overall heart function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One study found heart-protective polyphenols may also help promote higher levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol in people with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-metabolic-syndrome-8627830" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Support Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts have been found to positively influence &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; by promoting the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. These are microbes that play a vital role in maintaining overall health by aiding digestion, supporting the immune system and even contributing to the body’s metabolic processes. Research suggests that the bioactive compounds in walnuts, such as fiber and polyphenols, provide a favorable environment that helps your good gut bacteria thrive. That’s not just encouraging news for your digestive health. It’s also good for your heart as greater numbers of certain beneficial gut bacteria have been linked to lower cholesterol levels, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Human beings are inherently social. We thrive on connection, communication and shared experiences, which help shape our identities and foster a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, in an increasingly digital and fast-paced world, feelings of loneliness and social isolation have become alarmingly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="148489" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) has stated that these feelings are widespread. About 25 percent of older people &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/commission-on-social-connection#:%7E:text=People%20across%20all%20age%20groups,cent%20of%20adolescents%20experience%20loneliness"&gt;experience social isolation&lt;/a&gt; and 5 percent-15 percent of adolescents feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These figures are important since published studies have demonstrated that social isolation and loneliness are linked to increased risk of disease and death. Indeed, our own study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35676089/"&gt;published in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, found that social isolation in older people carried a 26 percent increased risk of developing dementia. We also found that loneliness was associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="148489" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to follow up our previous study by understanding the underlying biological processes behind this link between social isolation and loneliness and health. Why is loneliness so bad for our bodies and minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploring proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focused on proteomics, the study of proteins. This is because we know that proteins play a role in gene expression, the process by which the information encoded in a gene is turned into biological activity. Proteins are also a major source of drug targets for developing medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this collaborative study between the University of Cambridge and Fudan University, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02078-1"&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we used data from 42,062 participants from the UK Biobank and studied 2,920 plasma proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association between proteins and self-reported loneliness and social isolation. We discovered that the proteins found to be significantly associated with loneliness and social isolation are also known to be implicated in inflammation as well as antiviral and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, our study suggested that loneliness may lead to an increase in the levels of five specific proteins expressed in the brain (known as GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, all the proteins we identified as related to loneliness were "positively associated", meaning that people who feel lonely tend to have higher protein levels compared to those who do not feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also studied data that tracked the health of our participants for about 14 years. This found that more than half of the proteins were linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="148489" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our findings, having good social relationships and not feeling lonely may promote health by reducing the levels of certain harmful proteins. However, proteins may only partly explain the link between loneliness and health. Other potential pathways, such as social stress, may also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this may be the first demonstration of how loneliness affects morbidity and mortality through its association with these five key proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Societal impacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social isolation and loneliness affect all ages and genders and leads to major mental and physical health problems. This study helps to understand how this happens on a biological level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It demonstrates how important it is to connect with others through social activities, for example volunteering or team sport. This can reduce the effects of social isolation and loneliness on the underlying biological processes important for health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148500" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/men_playing_chess_642.jpg" alt="men being social playing chess" class="wp-image-148500 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/men_playing_chess_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/men_playing_chess_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148500" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Keeping social throughout our lives could be vital for our health.

This paradox – being surrounded by digital interactions yet feeling profoundly alone – underscores the importance of deep, meaningful social connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face-to-face social interactions where you also experience non-verbal communication often fosters better connections. Indeed one study showed that partners communicating face-to-face &lt;a href="https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/sites/liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/files/psychology/research/okdie_guadagno_bernieri_geers_mclarney-vesotski_2011.pdf"&gt;had more positive impressions&lt;/a&gt; than people interacting via a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social interactions are ultimately essential for our wellbeing, boosting both physical and mental health. Social connections reduce stress, lower blood pressure and support immune function. They also enhance cognitive health and improve brain health. In addition, they can foster empathy and understanding, strengthening our minds and providing emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, to foster a flourishing society we need to build meaningful connections with one another.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/245416/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

In hopes of assessing the risk to humans, they looked for "evidence of changes in the colon and lungs, as well as signs that the microplastics were having carcinogenic, or cancerous, effects," per the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;While the results of the study are concerning, other scientists warned that the findings could be premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;"We are still learning about the nature of the plastics in the human body and there is a lot of published research based on shaky assumptions," Matthew Campen, a professor and toxicologist at the University of New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote in an email to the Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote in an email to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.

Even more concerning is the fact that these tiny particles "are now virtually everywhere: in the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat," per the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;In addition to the potential connection between microplastics and cancer, research has linked ongoing exposure to lung disorders, neurological issues, immune system dysfunction, cancer, and other severe health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Despite the skepticism, some scientists praised the findings on microplastic exposure's link to cancer as a significant advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;"The conclusion about microplastic exposure being a 'suspected' hazard to human digestive, reproductive, and respiratory systems represents a stronger stance than many previous reviews in my opinion," Luís Fernando Amato-Lourenço, a postdoctoral researcher at the Free University of Berlin who studies microplastics in the body and was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told the Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="col-body mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Which of these factors is your biggest obstacle to purchasing an EV?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h6 class="col-body mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Click your choice to see results and speak your mind&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h3 class="col-body mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about this?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; painted a grim outlook regarding the push to reduce our exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/18/microplastics-colon-cancer-link-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:microplastics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;. While scientists have increasingly begun pushing for action from policymakers, progress has stalled.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca7ki001f3b72hsa5dn4w@published"&gt;I recently moved to a different country from the one I grew up in. I’m very happy with the life I have built for myself—I have a loving partner, a great community, and career-wise, I hold a high-ranking position that keeps me busy and challenged, but fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca7mu001g3b720kzyc190@published"&gt;The problem is my mother. Our relationship is strained, for a few reasons, one of which is that she’s always trying to subvert any boundaries I set. Case in point: I haven’t invited her to visit me since my move (partially because whenever we spend time together she does nothing but criticize me). So imagine my surprise when she called to tell me that she’d decided to vacation in my area for a week—as in, her plane had already landed and she was talking to me from her hotel room—and wanted to know if I was free for lunch on such-and-such a day “since she’s in town anyway.” Prudie, where I currently live is NOT her kind of place (think someone who doesn’t enjoy the beach talking about booking a vacation to Malibu), and she never mentioned any vacation plans to me before this. Not to sound conspiratorial, but I immediately thought this was a scheme to try and weasel in a visit with me despite not being invited.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca7sf001h3b7260o4rwqv@published"&gt;I told her I was very busy (which I am!) and that this really wasn’t a good time (which it wasn’t!) so I would have to decline meeting up this time. I also told her that I really wished she would’ve given me a heads-up before coming all the way here, but she just scoffed that I’m not the ruler of this country and she doesn’t need my permission to travel here if she feels like it. I wish that was the weirdest part of this whole thing, but unfortunately, it’s not. While we were on the phone, she also casually admitted to cyberstalking a couple of the people who work under me. That’s not the word she used but it’s what it sounded like to my ears: She reached out to them on LinkedIn and posed as a prospective client, asking them questions about the company, and specifically what they thought of their boss (me). It seemed obvious to me that she was trying to figure out what sort of outfit I was running so she’d have more things to criticize me about when next we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca7vw001i3b72st2lezty@published"&gt;My question is: How on Earth do I prevent her from pulling a stunt like this again? She technically hasn’t done anything illegal or wrong. But I’d rather not have to worry that at any moment she could be walking around casing my city without my knowing and interrogating my colleagues behind my back! Is that so unreasonable?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca8cm001l3b72v488ajid@published"&gt;I thought your mother’s conveniently, coincidental trip sounded fairly innocuous until I read the latter part of your letter, wherein she has resorted to catfishing your colleagues to get a read on your life. You were right to set and stick to your boundaries and not meet up with her during this visit, but you also need to communicate to her that this LinkedIn scheme is absolutely unacceptable and jeopardizes your professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca8fz001m3b72mg4ejujk@published"&gt;Part of me sympathizes with your mother’s obvious desperation to get close to you and find even a morsel of information about you, and I’d like to imagine there’s a happy fairytale solution to this where you figure out how to give her a tiny piece of connection and closeness so that she doesn’t feel like she has to track it down herself. But people who routinely cross boundaries like this are not known for their reasonableness, and I wonder if it’d be more productive to make your mother aware of how close she is to losing your relationship completely if she continues to make you feel this hunted.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lca8ic001n3b726p9wl1tk@published"&gt;The other part of me wonders if she’s always been like this, or if this is a notable escalation or change in behavior. Is it possible that your mother is exhibiting obsessive tendencies—that is, is it possible that she’s unwell? You’re not paranoid; her “stalking” is indeed out of the ordinary, and it gives me reason to wonder if there’s genuinely something serious going on with her mental well-being. Even if this is “just how she’s always been,” it doesn’t mean that she can’t benefit from getting help now. You can gently suggest she seek out a professional if that’s the case (or family therapy between the two of you could be a place to start), because your relationship depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5lcajls001w3b726fvu9mwb@published"&gt;It’s clear to me that my beloved 14-year-old dog, “Milo,” is at the end of his life and that it’s time to start making arrangements. He’s at the maximum dosage of three different pain medications and having stiffness, soreness, and major mobility issues throughout the day. He has fallen on the stairs a handful of times recently and I’m worried he’s going to hurt himself. During the day, Milo is mostly in a good mood, but at night, he struggles to get comfortable and paces around the room in the middle of the night panting.&lt;/p&gt;

We have the opportunity to choose the moment and be with him at the end and make sure it’s as peaceful as possible. My husband, “Chris” is having a hard time coming around. Because Milo is still eating, drinking, and enjoying short walks and affection from us, Chris thinks we should keep waiting. I think Chris is looking for the light to go out before making the call, whereas I never want to see the light go out. I fear the longer we wait, the more likely we are to come home from work to find him gone, or even worse, having to do it during a traumatic visit to the vet for an injury. I really believe in the old adage that it’s better a month too early than a day too late.&lt;/p&gt;

I adopted Milo about three years before Chris and I met and we’ve never really outgrown thinking of him as “my” dog when it comes to the important stuff. So I feel kind of stuck with a difficult responsibility and I want my partner’s buy-in that he is reluctant to give. I don’t think we should do it like tomorrow—but in about six weeks we’re going on vacation with some friends and it feels deeply wrong to leave Milo with a dog sitter during any part of his final time with us. So sometime in the next month, we need to get on the same page about this. (Again, I truly believe we’re on the cusp here, I would cancel the trip if I felt like we had more than six weeks of quality time left.) Can you help me figure out how to navigate this with Chris?&lt;/p&gt;

Chris may be in denial, but I think you’re within your rights to come down harder on how painful, sad, and cruel it would be to leave Milo at the hands of a stranger in his final hours, or to wait until Milo is decompensating in real-time. The ability to give a pet a loving, painless death is perhaps the ultimate responsibility of a pet owner. I would bring your boyfriend along on a vet appointment where he can hear these words coming from someone who’s personally seen far too many dogs suffering well past a dignified end.&lt;/p&gt;

I lost it when she randomly talking to a friend on speaker phone about how gross and cringe it was for old people to be having babies in their 40s. She smirked right at me while she said it and I started crying. My husband came out to the living room and his daughter claimed she didn’t do anything, and said that I was just hysterical, and always “spying” on her. They fought and she stormed out. She left for several days and didn’t tell anyone where she was.&lt;/p&gt;

I am six months pregnant and don’t need this stress! My husband keeps making excuses about how hard this is on his daughter. She’s not 6, she isn’t even 16. She is 21 and both her parents were married and working at her age. I was starting graduate school and working full-time. My stepdaughter doesn’t even have a part-time job right now. We pay all her bills. She doesn’t have to like or be happy about the situation but being civil is the bare minimum. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

The reality is that she’ll likely need a large degree of financial support to do so, which requires you and your husband to discuss how feasible that is for you two (and whether her other parent, if they’re in the picture, would be willing to pitch in) and for how long. Shift the focus from how awful your stepdaughter is being (she’s clearly taking out her unhappiness on you), and instead bring attention to how practically untenable your living arrangements are for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re now in their 60s and 70. Our parents did the best they could given the times. The 60-year-olds did therapy in their 20s and it in no way defines them. This wasn’t the case for the 70-year-old. He abused drugs. He blames our parents for his PTSD and lashes out with no apology or acknowledgment. I spent decades as his verbal punching bag to the point that it caused me PTSD and I had to step away. With no knowledge (despite my sharing) of his past behavior toward me, his wife wants me to reconcile. She claims he has no control over his actions, because “it’s his PTSD,” but this ignores mine and his direct role in it. I love my brother and want to reconcile but need him to acknowledge and apologize for the hurt he’s caused me but he will not.&lt;/p&gt;

Does it benefit you to preserve a small semblance of a relationship, or do you need to cut him off fully? Either option is a fully valid choice, in my opinion. Just because someone is family does not mean that you’re ever required to make yourself available to their verbal, emotional, or physical abuse, whatever state they’re in. You can love them from afar and mourn the loss of your relationship at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

It isn’t like anyone lost anything the second time around other than my own dignity and trust in men. I am very tempted to tell my fiancé to plan a destination trip with his parents so we can elope there.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Neil Glausier is co-owner and brewmaster at Burghers Brewing Company in Pittsburgh. But as a small business owner, he’s also just another guy in the trenches — working the production line, delivering beer, and keeping the books in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when faced with the prospect of updating the warning label currently displayed on every can of beer he sells, a move that he says could cost his brewery “tens of thousands” of dollars, Glausier doesn’t mince words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;There is no really good way to explain that it's a waste of money for what I think amounts to a political feelgood statement,” Glausier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General recently released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the link between alcohol consumption and some common forms of cancer. The advisory points out that some 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths occur every year, a number that surpasses the 13,500 deaths that occur annually as a result of drinking and driving. It recommends that current labels posted on alcoholic beverages be more prominent and include language that warns consumers about cancer risks associated with drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jessica Merlin, a physician and a Ph.D.-trained behavioral scientist who works at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC, acknowledges that there are harmful health effects associated with drinking alcohol, which include cancer. She also concedes that “mass media messages,” such as warning labels on alcoholic beverages and packs of cigarettes, reach a wide audience. She believes, too, though, that changing people’s behavior is “a lot more complicated than a warning label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the question I would want to ask the Surgeon General, and just sort of ask ourselves as a society, is, ‘What is the behavior change that we're after here?’” Merlin said. “Because I think: ‘What is the right amount of alcohol consumption for an individual?’ I think that's a question that is between an individual and themselves, their family, their doctor or nurse or whoever they seek primary care from. I think that's an important discussion to have. And that can lead to thoughts about, you know, behavior change and then things that can actually support behavior change if behavior change is the goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Surgeon General’s Advisory, alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind tobacco and obesity. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing at least seven types of cancer: mouth, throat, esophagus, voice box, breast, liver, colon and rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/assets/can-prevent/docs/2019-Survey.pdf" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Less than half of Americans&lt;/a&gt; are aware that alcohol consumption increases their risk of cancer. This lack of awareness, according to the Surgeon General, is a public health issue worth addressing through several means, including updating the current warning label on alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Glausier though, it’s a financial issue: Labels cost money. A retainer for a marketing company costs money. His time, and the time of his employees, costs money. And for an industry that, he says, still hasn’t “recovered from Covid-type numbers,” every dollar counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the impact an updated warning label might cause his business, Glausier is personally skeptical that an updated warning label would accomplish much in the way of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody's drinking for their health and nobody's really looking at a label and like, ‘oh my gosh, I need to really readjust my life choices here,’” Glausier said. “We're drinking for fun. We're drinking for, you know, engagement for community, whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glausier argued that small business supporters should be against additional costs to companies like his. When it comes to educating the public on the dangers of alcohol, Glausier said it’s not his job — or the government’s — to “parent” consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're adults here. We understand the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surgeon General’s Advisory calls for an updated warning label on alcoholic beverages — action that requires congressional approval. Glausier isn’t worried about immediate ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;No, I don't think it's a major concern right now,” Glausier said. “It's something that, you know, could be brooding down the line and would suck.

But the benefits of these drugs aren’t limited to what they can do for an individual’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent analysis of GLP-1 weight-loss therapies by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.citi.com/gps/YVtZitWJyccVYN6w6ycNUIrox9acK76uGACTnE1Ac3hl_lIRDPpO0x44_U2L2Wkj6ki940RpJa46Wk7tNpmrSORIqB0LRMfT" rel&gt;Citi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/pages/gs-research/weighing-the-glp1-market/report.pdf" rel&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; uncovered an interesting and underdiscussed benefit: increased worker productivity. Widely deployed, these drugs could raise labor productivity by up to 0.5 percent. That number may not sound like much, but such an acceleration would be a dramatic boost to the economy of the United States and the health of its citizens. In low-income and disadvantaged communities and regions, where obesity rates are often the highest and rates of work the lowest, access to these medications might be transformational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the paradoxes of our age is that the more economically disadvantaged you are, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2018/18_0217.htm" rel&gt;more likely you will be overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. For millennia, human beings were locked in subsistence economies, not always sure when or from where the next meal was coming. This environment made high-calorie and high-sugar foods especially prized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But in an era of food abundance, our genetically encoded calorie-seeking behavior is no longer a survival benefit. Quite the opposite, in fact. With abundant food, often laced with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/what-are-processed-foods/" rel&gt;saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/added-sugar-where-is-it-hiding" rel&gt;processed sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, chasing calories has become &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;life-shortening &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;behavior. Overeating and eating unhealthy foods leads to obesity, which cascades into a wide range of our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/health-problems-linked-obesity" rel&gt;most serious health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—heart disease, diabetes, kidney failure (all related to one another), cancer, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2793840" rel&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This cluster of obesity-driven conditions shortens lifespans and lessens well-being, while simultaneously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10394178/#:~:text=Studies%20have%20found%20that%20health,to%20be%20nearly%20%24114%20billion." rel&gt;draining our healthcare system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Federal and state governments have in the past focused most anti-obesity efforts on behavior modification, the same thing doctors recommend for everyone: diet and exercise. Outcomes for many of these programs have shown positive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8219622/" rel&gt;but short-lived effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Any frequent dieter who has seen their weight yoyo has faced a similar and discouraging problem: The body “remembers” its prior weight, interprets weight loss as starvation, and seeks to regain the pounds. A 2016 study in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4989512/" rel&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;found that among participants in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; reality TV series, virtually all participants in the show’s extreme diet and exercise program regained a significant portion of the weight they lost, and some exceeded the weight at which they started. GLP-1s, on the other hand, target the physical mechanisms of overeating rather than treating it exclusively as a problem of willpower or behavior modification, offering obese people a way to lose weight and keep it off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The underlying theory of the Goldman Sachs estimates of GLP-1 economic impact is simple: By reducing the disease burden in the population, worker productivity will increase significantly. Less illness equals healthier people and more work, an especially important effect for populations in which employment levels are persistently below average and obesity rates above average. Minority women are much more likely to be obese than white women, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm" rel&gt;CDC health statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The rate of obesity for white women is 39.8 percent compared to 56.9 percent for black women and 43.7 for Hispanic women. Additionally, women with lower incomes experience higher rates of obesity, whereas for men, obesity rates are similar across income levels. Male obesity seems relatively similar across races with low-income males more exposed than higher-income males.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obesity and its related health conditions also show signs of being intergenerational for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34556834/" rel&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24566855/" rel&gt;epigenetic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9217594/" rel&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reasons. In other words, obesity isn’t just a problem for individuals; it is heritable and has community-wide effects on health, well-being, and very likely employment. As such, it should be addressed as a community-based, intergenerational, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w17423" rel&gt;employment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; challenge. We could be treating fewer cases of heart disease, cancer, and dementia if we did a better job of interrupting the eating behaviors that contribute to them. This might be the right moment to try a community-based GLP-1 experiment. Bowling Green, Kentucky, now known as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/nx-s1-5072571/ozempic-takes-over-the-kentucky-city-of-bowling-green" rel&gt;Ozempic capital of the country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, has something of a natural experiment going on as a large portion of the city is seeking GLP-1 treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past few years, the federal government has launched a number of new workforce-related initiatives that could benefit from voluntary obesity-reduction &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nwi.pdx.edu/wraparound-basics/" rel&gt;wraparound interventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Under the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/business/economy/chips-act-childcare.html" rel&gt;CHIPS and Science Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/workforce-development-and-business-owner-training-programs" rel&gt;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/build-back-better-explained.html" rel&gt;Build Back Better Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/American-rescue-plan" rel&gt;American Rescue Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the federal government is making significant investments in workforce development programs aimed at increasing access to training, skills, and employment in disadvantaged areas of the country. Many of these projects are in regions with high levels of joblessness and obesity. A voluntary wellness program that incorporates diet, exercise, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; access to GLP-1 medications seems like a good fit for addressing chronic and endemic obesity while also building technical skills and placing participants in jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Such an effort would likely require additional resources. In some cases, state Medicaid programs may be able to help defray costs. However, without insurance, GLP-1 treatments can run to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/helping-patients-navigate-high-costs-glp-1-medications-2024a1000ac4?form=fpf" rel&gt;$1,000 per month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or more, meaning they would likely need support from outside these workforce-related grants. Moreover, obesity is a progressive disease that doesn’t completely go away with drug therapy, likely requiring ongoing access to medication and long-term financial commitments. As the drugs become cheaper and more plentiful—including through the development of new compounds—prices should decline. In the meantime, philanthropic efforts could fill the gap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The potential payoffs of widespread obesity reduction are great. The savings from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cardiology/glp-1-saved-heart-failure-patients-more-than-7k-in-medical-costs.html" rel&gt;reduced health-care costs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for chronic diseases would likely offset much of the costs of the intervention, not to mention the harder-to-measure but substantial psychosocial improvements for individuals and families. Meanwhile, communities would benefit from a healthier workforce more capable of gaining and keeping jobs. As people consider weight loss for themselves this season, let’s take this opportunity to think about making these treatments widely accessible—so in the spirit of “new year, new you” we can hope for new communities, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/ozempic-community-glp-1-wegovy-weight-loss-obesity-workforce?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Share this article with someone with whom you’ve discussed the new GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/ozempic-community-glp-1-wegovy-weight-loss-obesity-workforce?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/ozempic-community-glp-1-wegovy-weight-loss-obesity-workforce?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 10:27:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQUDROeU01Qm9RelZ6WnVFR1V0eXByRVBLb1dNaURZMFE4SVlYVi1JR2RETXpyTDBQZFZxTkFVZjIzdklEZDUzUTdsNkFDaXlKQTBBLWRSWEdBTVVrcXlBZm00VUZzaWtoMmRPOUgzTW9FMDNFaVU5RGlVdVpUckk2bHl6SnBLeW9zeGtfWDRnZXBHY2M</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu risk remains low after first US death, WHO says - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNNlVaSVRkeXpRSENaVFg3YkczNlRleFhJUkRMM1pLN1lyRmdhVHVmbENUMFV1Z3ViZ3hfeGY3Wm1obGFNMTM2MUJPMmZiOHdYOUs3T1h1aTVwZGxCLTFZb2NsNTFiNGNjdzJqZnFPR0xjenRiSjBBTlNwY0w4YWRuWDJXNDE5MkFTeHd6N3dneHAyc0RxZFJWampvYkR3clRJWnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 10:27:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNNlVaSVRkeXpRSENaVFg3YkczNlRleFhJUkRMM1pLN1lyRmdhVHVmbENUMFV1Z3ViZ3hfeGY3Wm1obGFNMTM2MUJPMmZiOHdYOUs3T1h1aTVwZGxCLTFZb2NsNTFiNGNjdzJqZnFPR0xjenRiSjBBTlNwY0w4YWRuWDJXNDE5MkFTeHd6N3dneHAyc0RxZFJWampvYkR3clRJWnc</guid></item><item><title>Aussie scientists use toxins to kill off world's most dangerous creature - Yahoo News Australia</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNR1pvSmhTZmRfeC1HQWF2VFVGc0tVRzFvTGd5UGRmTG5yVGhRa3gyOEhrZi12bFJZWXU2RGFxeFpQWDRGTzE5NHU3QmdXZmF3MDJYVjBqYzQxbjhYMkhrWURGbTNaMnpMdU96Vy1yQ1VJZmlRdTgwVURUX2dRV1VTYWhiUXFvY1A0d0p5cGpPR21PdHhkQXl6cHJPWFZhVF9OMUROQzNSWFc5ejk1LU1CWDRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia is home to some of the&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/travellers-could-trigger-mosquito-disease-outbreak-in-australia-as-weather-warms-063950442.html" data-ylk="slk:world’s most deadly creatures.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; world’s most deadly creatures.&lt;/a&gt; So it’s not surprising that local scientists turned to venom from &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/spiders/" data-ylk="slk:spiders;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; and sea anemones to combat the insect responsible for the most deaths in the world – mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Applied BioSciences and the ARC Centre of Excellence in Synthetic Biology at Macquarie University have genetically engineered male insects so they carry toxins that are transferred during mating, shortening the lifespan of females. Their research, published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://10.0.4.14/s41467-024-54863-1." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Communications;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found the process could reduce their lifespan by 37 to 64 per cent. It also concluded blood feeding rates could plummet by 40 to 60 per cent compared to established methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Sam Beach told Yahoo News biocontrols are preferable to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/windscreen-detail-on-road-trip-suggests-worrying-natural-trend-in-australia-where-have-they-gone-061309689.html" data-ylk="slk:insecticides;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;insecticides&lt;/a&gt; as mosquitoes are becoming resistant to them, and chemicals don’t just kill their target species, they also cause indiscriminate harm to the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still in the early stages of development of this technology and there are a lot of regulatory and safety concerns that need to be grappled with.

She wasn’t producing any offspring but the downside was she was still hanging around and spreading disease,” Beach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we’d only see a reduction in numbers in subsequent generations. So if a city was in the midst of some epidemic, it wasn’t any comfort that the situation would get better in three to six months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rather than use harmful chemicals as a control measure (background) the scientists opted for venom from the Mediterranean snakelocks sea anemone (bottom) and banana spider (top). Source: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toxic Male Technique biocontrol is the first of its kind and it offers a fast alternative to insecticides. The trials used venom from Brazil's banana spider &lt;em&gt;(Phoneutria nigriventer) &lt;/em&gt;and the Mediterranean snakelocks sea anemone &lt;em&gt;(Anemonia sulcata) &lt;/em&gt;on common fruit flies &lt;em&gt;(Drosophila melanogaster).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="are-mosquitoes-a-major-threat-in-australia"&gt;Are mosquitoes a major threat in Australia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years mosquitoes were nothing more than a nuisance on mainland Australia, making it hard to sleep at night because of their irritating buzz, and causing itchy bites. But they’re now responsible for a growing number of dangerous diseases including Buruli ulcer, Ross River virus and Japanese encephalitis. And as the climate changes, mosquitoes that carry dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika virus could become established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overseas these diseases are already causing major impacts on health and economic growth. It’s estimated around 1 million people die from health complications associated with mosquitoes every year and between 400 and 700 million contract some sort of illness from their bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 10 per cent of the world’s 3,500 mosquito species carry diseases that impact human health. So the team would only target those which are a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="could-the-venom-harm-frogs-and-fish-that-eat-mosquitoes"&gt;Could the venom harm frogs and fish that eat mosquitoes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research indicates there is little danger that animals that eat mosquitoes will be significantly affected by the venom. That’s important because 40 per cent of amphibians and 25 per cent of freshwater fish are threatened with extinction and they are common predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we were looking at what proteins, we wanted to make sure they were very specific for insects,” Beach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These proteins also evolved to be very toxic when directly injected.

Is there any science behind them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/well/live/menopause-symptoms-age-women.html" title=""&gt;common symptoms of menopause&lt;/a&gt;. But the skin can undergo changes in midlife too, including sagging, thinning and becoming more dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Estrogen is key to maintaining skin integrity, said Dr. Susan Massick, a dermatologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. When estrogen levels dip during menopause, your skin can become thinner with less collagen and elasticity, potentially causing more dryness or wrinkling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some skin care companies sell estrogen-infused face creams and serums — available over-the-counter or via prescription — that are supposed to prevent and reverse these changes. One &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.instagram.com/drjashton/reel/C8o7nbgOJnO/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;doctor on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; even said that using prescription vaginal estrogen cream on your face can increase collagen production and minimize dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While this use of estrogen cream “makes sense, in theory,” Dr. Massick said, we need more research showing that it is safe and effective. Here is what we know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-104a7b73"&gt;Can topical estrogen benefit your skin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In one &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647519300012?via%3Dihub#s0020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;review published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed the results of about two dozen studies. They involved menopausal and postmenopausal women who used topical estrogen — including in gels, creams, ointments and patches — on their faces, abdomen, buttocks, forearms and thighs. The authors concluded that it was “plausible” that estrogen could minimize wrinkles and improve skin dryness, texture and elasticity. However, the studies they reviewed had various limitations, including that they looked at small groups of women. And some of the review’s authors were consultants for a skin care pharmaceutical company, presenting a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171d1bw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

This means people across the world have "some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure", Dr Hsu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life," says Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"So overall, I don't think there is currently any signs of a more serious global issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Still, Dr Hsu advises standard general precautions such as wearing a mask in crowded places, avoiding crowds where possible if one is at higher risk of more severe illness from respiratory virus infections, practising good hand hygiene, and getting the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:46:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE04bEQwdVR5NThwUC1GSGstYUdlSmNzcXJQUnQ4V3kwdGYyR00zcmR5NHZsZklBb1ItSDVBZURyUEFRM2IyN1lRam9KNFJCbFVFUkc4QVJTR0QyQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1HbHVkdXZodU02UFVLblVfTUg0cTB0aHJRdlRENzExMWNobUszOS1zNk9vNjJTYUFMTlBDYnRvQXk1LWVUTEFYMk43STBBa0s2VnVXNDlNR3d0WjRVR0Zr</guid></item><item><title>What We Know About HMPV, the Virus Spreading in China - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1OUUc2MVBRbGVNUnozTVE3WEpFSDNlRlhCMWJVZE91R0FtQlpLZlB5QzlOQVlmSzk2V3UyUUZSSm5reUQ2MGhZSC1XOUFCVXE1OFBSaGFNQzFtMEdSX1IwVGxuV3dOM2J0dDU3YnhUVHo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Reports of a surge in cases of a respiratory virus in China have evoked dark echoes of the start of the Covid-19 pandemic almost exactly five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But despite the surface similarities, this situation is very different, and far less worrisome, medical experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Chinese cases are reported to be infections with human metapneumovirus, known to doctors as HMPV. Here is what we know so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-4a244850"&gt;What is HMPV?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is one of several pathogens that circulate across the world each year, causing respiratory illnesses. HMPV is common — so common that most people will be infected while they are still children and may experience several infections in their lifetimes. In countries with months of cold weather HMPV can have an annual season, much like the flu, while in places closer to the Equator it circulates at lower levels all year long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;HMPV is similar to a virus that is better known in the United States — respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;-- CDC is saddened by Louisiana's report that a person previously hospitalized with severe avian influenza A(H5N1) illness ("H5N1 bird flu") has passed away. While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death. As of January 6, 2025, there have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the United States since 2024 and 67 since 2022. This is the first person in the United States who has died as a result of an H5 infection. Outside the United States, more than 950 cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2024--20-december-2024" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="int"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;span class="visually-hidden sr-only" aria-label=" external icon" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cdc-icon-external cdc-link-icon" aria-hidden="true" alt="external icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; about half of those have resulted in death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified. As with the case in Louisiana, most H5 bird flu infections are related to animal-to-human exposures. Additionally, there are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry, or cows that would raise the risk to human health. (CDC reported previously on its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-12232024.html"&gt;analysis of the viruses isolated from the patient in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.) However, people with job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk of infection. For these and others, CDC has developed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/index.html"&gt;prevention resources about how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC is continually: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="nested-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Supporting critical epidemiologic investigations with state and local partners to assess the public health impact of each H5 case.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Working closely with state and local partners to conduct active surveillance for H5 cases.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Monitoring for changes that might suggest H5 viruses are becoming better adapted to mammals and therefore might spread more easily from animals-to-humans or human-to-human or cause more severe disease.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Monitoring for any viral changes that could make these viruses less responsive to flu antiviral medications or the available candidate vaccine viruses.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information about H5 bird flu is available on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="py-2 smallish text-muted border-bottom border-alto-gray w-100" itemprop="description"&gt;
© Elle Katie/Pixabay | Good news! A couple of glasses of wine a day has a positive effect on health, according to the latest research.        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the US government released a report that shows that moderate alcohol consumption lowers your risk of dying, compared to not drinking. One would think this would be big news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There was a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality among those who consumed moderate levels of alcohol compared with those who never consumed alcohol," says the report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Health (NASEM).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite this good news, last Friday, after pardoning Hunter Biden and commuting the sentences of 37 convicted murderers, the Biden administration decided to join the New York Times in ignoring the science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Outgoing surgeon general Vivek Murthy called for a cancer warning label on alcohol. Murthy doesn't have the power to make this law: he needs an act of Congress. When Bill Clinton's surgeon general Joycelyn Elders said in 1994 that &lt;a href="/regions-usa"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;'s schools should teach kids to masturbate, she didn't have the power to order that either. Clinton fired Elder; Biden doesn't need to fire Murthy as both will be out of office in a fortnight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, alcohol &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; increase the risk of breast cancer by 10 percent compared to not drinking at all, according to the comprehensive report from NASEM. The 14-member panel also found a "statistically nonsignificant higher risk of colorectal cancer" for moderate alcohol drinkers. So that's bad news for wine lovers. But there's a big "however" that the surgeon general and the New York Times are choosing to ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for 608,371 deaths in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control. However, the number one killer of Americans is heart disease, responsible for 702,880 deaths in 2022.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the NASEM report confirmed what researchers have shown for decades: moderate alcohol consumption reduces your risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report shows a 22 percent lower risk of heart attack for moderate alcohol drinkers vs. non-drinkers, along with an 11 percent lower risk of stroke. Strokes were the fifth largest killer of Americans in 2022, responsible for 165,393 deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add it all up, and people under 60 years old who drink alcohol in moderation – one to two drinks per day – have a 20 percent lower risk of dying than non-drinkers, according to NASEM. For people over 60, there's an 18 percent lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One would think the US Surgeon General and the nation's leading newspaper would celebrate such good news. I'm going to do a whole story about the New York Times' ongoing irresponsible journalism regarding alcohol, so I'll tackle that later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Meet the new boss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for Biden's surgeon general's outgoing gesture, it's likely to be ignored by the incoming Trump team. That said, like Biden, president-elect Donald Trump does not drink alcohol. (Please Americans, we gotta stop electing these teetotallers. No matter which party you prefer, the great presidents – Reagan, both Roosevelts, Eisenhower, etc. – all liked to drink. In moderation.) And Trump's nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., speaks openly of his past struggles with alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's hard to predict what, if anything, a new GOP-led Congress will do about an outgoing Democrat's call for a warning label, but it's worth noting that the Congressional Wine Caucus lists 127 members from both parties out of 435 House representatives. In the Senate, though, only two of the Wine Caucus' 14 members are Republicans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big battle continues to be over the upcoming dietary guidelines. Currently, the US recommends that alcohol be limited to two drinks per day for men and one for women. There is an ongoing temperance movement to lower that recommendation. A similar effort in &lt;a href="/regions-canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has failed so far, despite many erroneous reports to the contrary. Health Canada, the government agency responsible for Canada's health policy, rejected an austere recommendation from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction. Canada currently recommends no more than 10 drinks per week for women and 15 for men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress empowered NASEM to answer eight questions about alcohol and health specifically to inform the next dietary guidelines. While the peer-reviewed, scientific results regarding the increased risk of breast cancer are sobering, the rest of the report is generally very good news for moderate drinkers. That's the science – the best work from the best research committee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is the best-done study," said Laura Catena, a medical doctor who also runs &lt;a href="/merchant/24993-bodegas-catena-zapata"&gt;her family&lt;/a&gt;'s winery in &lt;a href="/regions-argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. "They really made sure the controls were never-drinkers. They compared to non-drinkers. It's the most careful look at the data from prestigious professors. The NASEM report is so pure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is, who will follow the science?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD) is also working on daily drinking guidelines for adults, even though that has nothing to do with underage drinking. The new Congress could soon have competing reports to consider.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) told Wine Searcher: "Any change to Americans' dietary guidelines should be fully transparent and use the best science – we know NASEM's study meets those rigorous scientific standards. We don't have the same transparency with the duplicative ICCPUD study. I encourage USDA and HHS to take NASEM's findings into account when developing the 2025 Dietary Guidelines."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is the politics of alcohol in full view," said Rob McMillan, executive vice president of Silicon Valley Bank's wine division. "Given the lame-duck status of the current Surgeon General, you would have to conclude that implementation of the NASEM report's recommendations, which have to be approved by Congress, could be delayed for an extended time given the press of other national priorities, and or subject to change in either direction."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that the total population of a country might be healthier if nobody drank at all; this is why countries with national health plans like the UK discourage drinking. The greatest risk to public health from alcohol is alcoholism; second is binge drinking. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated in 2023 that 10.2 percent of Americans have Alcohol Use Disorder. If someone never drinks at all, they won't be as healthy on average as a moderate drinker, but they will be healthier than an alcoholic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catena compares the surgeon general's recent advice to telling people to stay indoors all the time because sunburn and skin cancer are health risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"To me, moderate drinking is like wearing a hat," Catena told Wine-Searcher. "Can you imagine the surgeon general saying 'Don't go outside'? He says 'Wear sunscreen and wear a hat.' There are benefits to going outside – social benefits. What we're saying is, drink in moderation. Alcohol is good for you in moderation. People are afraid to say it's good for you. But it is good for you in moderation."&lt;/p&gt;                                                            &lt;div class="pt-4 mt-4 font-light-bold border-top border-alto-gray"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 19-year-old woman’s breasts stunningly grew from a B cup to a triple G in the six months following her Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2024/12000/the__pfizer_boob_job___a_case_of_unexplained.52.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in what researchers are calling a first-of-its-kind case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unidentified “healthy young woman” reportedly started experiencing the rapid growth one week after getting vaccinated in September 2022 — and it worsened after her second dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The patient believed that the vaccine caused her breast growth; however, her concerns were not adequately addressed by her primary care physicians, leading to mistrust in the healthcare system,” Toronto-based researchers wrote last month in the Plastic &amp;amp; Reconstructive Surgery-Global Open journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More than 13.6 billion COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide since 2020. Researchers are reporting a woman’s breasts grew several cup sizes after receiving the vaccine in 2022. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This is a photo of the woman before she underwent breast reduction surgery in 2023. Her breasts had grown from a B cup to a triple G. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Pfizer Boob Job: A Case of Unexplained Gigantomastia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors pointed to the so-called &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/27/woman-in-australia-reports-experiencing-awkward-headlight-issue-after-getting-pfizer-vaccine"&gt;“Pfizer boob job” phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; — some women claimed their breasts grew after getting the shot, but there’s no evidence that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers report that while lymph node swelling is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10098240/#:~:text=Abstract,patients%20treated%20for%20breast%20cancer." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“known side effect”&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccination, changes to the structure or density of breast tissue are “exceedingly rare.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The woman five months after reduction surgery, now with double D breasts. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Pfizer Boob Job: A Case of Unexplained Gigantomastia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors said there’s only been one published case detailing distinctive breast changes after the Pfizer booster, and it was a noticeable lump. This woman did not have a lump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman was found to have a very rare condition in which a benign lesion called PASH causes extreme breast enlargement — fewer than 20 cases have ever been documented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This case is the first to demonstrate a temporal association between PASH-associated gigantomastia and a vaccine,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post reached out to Pfizer for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman reported feeling a tingling in her breasts before they grew. Doctors didn’t notice hormonal changes in her blood work and prescribed her steroids and antibiotics to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her breasts stopped growing after six months and she underwent reduction surgery five months later, according to the case report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She lost a lot of blood during the procedure, which limited the amount of breast tissue surgeons could remove. She has double D breasts and may get another breast reduction to return to her normal size.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Toronto study authors are calling for further research to see if there’s a link between the COVID-19 vaccine, PASH and rapid breast growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;More than 13.6 billion COVID-19 doses&lt;/a&gt; have been administered worldwide since 2020.

Norovirus is one of the most contagious infections we know of, and to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/norovirus-outbreak-spread-contagious-infectious-disease-doctor-advice-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;help prevent its spread&lt;/a&gt;, you need to be vigilant about washing your hands and disinfecting surfaces, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to do if you're experiencing symptoms is to stay hydrated. When you're losing so much fluid, particularly if you can't keep any fluids down, there's a risk of dehydration, which can become life-threatening, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for these symptoms as warning flags&lt;/strong&gt;: If you reach the point of dizziness or light-headedness, Gohil said, then you may be dangerously dehydrated, and that's when you need to get yourself to an ER. When you get a headache, that's an early warning sign of dehydration and an indicator that you need to increase your fluid intake, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are very young, very old, or immunocompromised can have infections that last longer, and they may be at higher risk of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay special attention&lt;/strong&gt;: Gohil also mentioned a few signs of dehydration to look out for in people who can't speak for themselves, like babies and nonverbal seniors. And that's if they cannot form tears, if their mouth looks dry, if they're despondent, or if they're not really reacting to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9b488a33-8cb4-4480-8114-6a6c04e38f64" data-toc-id="9b488a33-8cb4-4480-8114-6a6c04e38f64"&gt;Why norovirus is so bad this year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the total number of norovirus outbreaks, Gohil said it's pretty bad this year.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for that, she said, is that more and more people are gathered together for the holiday season this year than they did in the last few years when COVID-19 was a more immediate concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got more outbreaks, people are unmasked, people are engaging with each other, they're not cleaning their hands, clearly," Gohil said. "Cleaning and disinfection and all that stuff is down. And we need to shore those practices back up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, there were also years when norovirus outbreaks spiked just like they are now, and fluctuations like this are normal, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an important role to play in helping prevent the spread of norovirus, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could literally, just by being careful yourself, save other people's lives indirectly. That's really, really important for people to understand, that you live in a community, " she said, "and that you have a responsibility to care, and to keep yourself clean, and keep others safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, wash your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a renowned cardiac surgeon has made waves by revealing startling information about the foods that may be slowly poisoning our bodies. This eye-opening revelation has sparked a much-needed conversation about the impact of our dietary choices on our overall health and well-being. Let’s delve into the specifics of these harmful substances and explore why they should be avoided at all costs according to &lt;a href="https://www.drjeremylondon.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.drjeremylondon.com/"&gt;M.D Jeremy London&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The hidden dangers lurking in processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant threats to our health comes from ultra-processed foods, which have become a staple in many people’s diets. These convenience items, often found in fast-food restaurants and grocery store aisles, are packed with artificial ingredients, preservatives, and unhealthy fats that can wreak havoc on our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1185546749"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast food&lt;/strong&gt; is particularly notorious for its negative impact on health. While it may be tempting to grab a quick burger or pizza, these meals are often loaded with &lt;i&gt;trans fats, excessive sodium, and refined carbohydrates&lt;/i&gt;. Regular consumption of fast food has been linked to a host of health issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/06/heartwarming-rescue-lonely-dog-found-woods-using-pine-needles-as-makeshift-bed/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Rescuers find dog alone in the woods making a bed out of pine needles&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Heart disease&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To maintain optimal health, it’s crucial to &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/if-you-want-financial-stability-say-goodbye-these-6-costly-behaviors/"&gt;say goodbye to these costly behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, including the habit of relying on fast food for quick meals. Instead, focus on preparing nutrient-dense, whole foods at home to nourish your body properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-699684265"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;The silent killer in our drinks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many people are aware of the dangers of unhealthy foods, they often overlook the harmful effects of certain beverages. Sugary drinks, particularly sodas, have been described by health experts as “liquid death” due to their detrimental impact on our bodies.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary culprits in these drinks are:



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive sugar content&lt;/strong&gt;: A single can of soda can contain more than the recommended daily intake of sugar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/strong&gt;: Even “diet” versions of these drinks may contain chemicals that pose potential health risks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phosphoric acid&lt;/strong&gt;: This common ingredient in sodas can lead to decreased bone density and increased risk of kidney problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect your health, it’s essential to &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/27/if-you-want-genuine-happiness-say-goodbye-these-10-behaviours/"&gt;say goodbye to these behaviors&lt;/a&gt; that compromise your well-being, including the consumption of sugary drinks. Opt for water, herbal teas, or natural fruit-infused beverages instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/06/ancient-egyptian-sarcophagus-discovered-ceremonial-road-3400-years/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Rethinking our relationship with dairy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While dairy products have long been touted as essential for strong bones and overall health, recent research has called this notion into question. The cardiac surgeon’s revelations have shed light on the potential drawbacks of consuming dairy products, especially in large quantities.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following table showcasing the pros and cons of dairy consumption:



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Source of calcium&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;High in saturated fat&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Contains protein&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;May cause digestive issues&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Provides vitamin D (fortified)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Potential hormonal imbalances&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that humans are the only mammals that continue to consume milk beyond infancy, and from a different species, no less. This fact alone should give us pause and prompt us to reconsider our dairy intake. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/02/people-high-emotional-intelligence-use-these-8-habits-daily-life/"&gt;People with high emotional intelligence&lt;/a&gt; often question societal norms and make informed decisions about their health, including their dietary choices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;The toxic truth about alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with certain health benefits in some studies, the cardiac surgeon’s findings paint a stark picture of its overall impact on our bodies. According to this expert, alcohol is “absolutely toxic to every cell in our body,” even when consumed in moderation.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harmful effects of alcohol extend far beyond the commonly known risks of liver damage and addiction. Regular alcohol consumption can lead to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/05/one-million-woman-gives-birth-quadruplets-including-two-pairs-identical-twins/"&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of certain cancers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Weakened immune system&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cognitive decline and memory issues&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Disrupted sleep patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To truly prioritize your health, it may be necessary to &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/23/if-you-want-lasting-success-say-goodbye-these-8-procrastination-traps/"&gt;say goodbye to these procrastination traps&lt;/a&gt; that prevent us from making positive changes, including the habit of regular alcohol consumption. By eliminating or significantly reducing alcohol intake, you can potentially improve various aspects of your physical and mental well-being.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-5"&gt;Embracing a healthier lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge about the foods and drinks that may be poisoning our bodies, it’s time to take action and make positive changes to our lifestyles. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/12/8-common-traits-people-who-consistently-reach-their-goals/"&gt;People who consistently reach their goals&lt;/a&gt; often do so by making incremental changes and developing healthy habits over time.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve your overall health and well-being, consider implementing the following strategies:



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole foods focus&lt;/strong&gt;: Base your diet on unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal planning&lt;/strong&gt;: Prepare meals at home to have better control over ingredients and portion sizes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;: Replace sugary drinks with water, herbal teas, or infused water for optimal hydration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindful eating&lt;/strong&gt;: Pay attention to hunger cues and practice eating slowly to avoid overconsumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporate physical activity into your daily routine to support overall health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, making significant lifestyle changes can be challenging, but it’s essential for long-term health and well-being. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/29/7-habits-that-help-build-inner-confidence-time/"&gt;Building inner confidence&lt;/a&gt; through small, consistent actions can help you stay committed to your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/05/woman-faces-eviction-sheltering-homeless-kind-act-backfires-as-housing-crisis-deepens/"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being mindful of the foods we consume and making informed choices, we can take control of our health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It’s never too late to start making positive changes, and the benefits of a healthier lifestyle are well worth the effort. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/16/9-ways-deepen-connection-everyday-moments/"&gt;Deepening our connection&lt;/a&gt; with our bodies and understanding the impact of our dietary choices is a crucial step towards a healthier, happier life.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we navigate the complexities of modern nutrition, it’s important to stay informed and &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/06/people-who-naturally-inspire-trust-often-display-these-10-behaviors/"&gt;trust in the guidance of health professionals&lt;/a&gt; who dedicate their lives to understanding the intricate relationships between diet and health. By heeding their advice and making conscious decisions about what we put into our bodies, we can work towards a future of improved health and vitality for ourselves and future generations.

He took Paxlovid a year later for 15 days and reported a month later feeling ‘radically better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another was a middle-aged woman who developed severe Covid in March 2020. Since then, she had experienced sustained respiratory symptoms, fatigue, brain fog, and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a 10-day course of Paxlovid, she saw major improvements in brain fog, respiratory issues, and cardiovascular health. Her heart rate during exercise improved, and she could take work trips without worsening symptoms, something she hadn’t been able to do since Long COVID began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paxlovid is an antiviral medication &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10415839/Pfizers-antiviral-Covid-pill-shows-effectiveness-against-Omicron-variant-lab-tests.html"&gt;approved to treat Covid&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. It was hailed as a game changer with a 90 percent efficacy rate that would finally stem the tide of fatalities linked to the virus. It has not been approved to treat long Covid, however; no drug has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 17 million Americans have long Covid - a constellation of symptoms including shortness of breath, fatigue, heart inflammation, joint pain, brain fog, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00668-8"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;by a coalition of American researchers is not the first examination of Paxlovid for long Covid. Last year, investigators from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-7fe21600-cc83-11ef-a87c-831f09d5bb54"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; San Francisco Medical Center found little to no benefit after a five-day course of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers behind the latest study believe that an extended course of Paxlovid may benefit some people living with long Covid. Given the lack of treatments for the puzzling condition, researchers argue their findings indicate existing antiviral medications should be explored further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Alison Cohen, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and first author of the paper, said: ‘This is not a silver bullet, but it may help a lot of people in a meaningful way.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some study participants did not see improvements in their symptoms for at least 10 days, suggesting that a longer duration of treatment is key to sustained health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The standard course for Paxlovid is five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 13 subjects had been experiencing brain fog, fatigue, respiratory problems, body aches, and post-exertional malaise (PEM) – feeling extremely tired after doing a manageable task like washing the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 56-year-old man developed mild Covid in March 2020 and ongoing long Covid symptoms, including PEM, brain fog, and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he took Paxlovid for 15 days in December 2022, he reported that for the first time in years, his muscles no longer felt like ‘dead weights.’ His brain fog abated, his thoughts were clearer, and his memory improved. He could walk continuously, and the arthritic pain in his hands disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paxlovid may also help with cardiac symptoms associated with long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 45-year-old woman who had contracted mild Covid in March 2022 later developed long Covid and suffered from tachycardia, or abnormally fast heart rate, memory loss, and PEM. She was also diagnosed with POTS, a condition affecting the nervous system that causes the heart rate to jump when a person stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking Paxlovid for 15 days in February 2023, she noted significant improvements in her memory, mental clarity, and physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (difficulty standing up without feeling faint or lightheaded) fully resolved. Some symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome, a condition in which the body's mast cells release too many chemicals, lingered, but improved with treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people experienced relief for a relatively short window of time, indicating to researchers Paxlovid is not a cure-all for everyone with long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 40-year-old man lost his sense of smell when he was diagnosed with Covid in March 2020. It returned when he recovered from the infection, but he had lingering nerve pain, gastrointestinal issues, and blurry vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had tried Paxlovid for his long Covid symptoms several times and saw improvement, though it lasted for about two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And for some people, Paxlovid did not make any noticeable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 34-year-old woman who had Covid in the fall of 2021 developed PEM after she recovered, leading to a hospitalization for chronic fatigue. She was given Paxlovid in May 2022 for 15 days but did not experience any change in her symptoms during or after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 45-year-old woman developed long Covid symptoms in 2022, including fatigue, chest pain, and migraines. She had been diagnosed with POTS, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic inflammation of the thin sac surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had taken a five-day course of Paxlovid in October 2022 and ‘felt normal’ for a few days until symptoms rebounded. A month later, she was placed on a 15-day Paxlovid regimen, which ‘did not improve her fatigue or her other symptoms in any way,’ according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their study was published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00668-8#Sec21"&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid is an amorphous condition made up of a constellation of symptoms from brain fog and fatigue to heart inflammation and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 17 million Americans have long Covid, which manifests differently in each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may only experience shortness of breath and fatigue, while others may only experience brain fog and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9779497/Blood-test-spot-long-Covid-ready-SIX-MONTHS.html"&gt;diagnosing long Covid&lt;/a&gt; is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years ago, American, Danish, and British researchers concluded that long Covid &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12557947/Risks-long-Covid-greatly-exaggerated.html"&gt;has been ‘greatly exaggerated.’&lt;/a&gt; Soon after, another UK-based scientist acknowledged that the condition is real but argued that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12585569/PROFESSOR-ROB-GALLOWAY-long-covid-wrong.html"&gt;more patients have been labeled&lt;/a&gt; with it than actually have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Peluso, lead investigator at UCSF’s long covid research program, said: ‘If we’ve learned one thing over the last four years, it’s that long COVID is complex, and figuring out why some people benefit so remarkably from antiviral treatment while others don’t is one of the most important questions for the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We are going to need to embrace that complexity to get answers for the millions of people suffering from this condition.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Cold weather can pack a serious punch for vulnerable
populations. Cardiologists in the Triangle are warning North Carolinians of the
increased risk of heart attacks during cooler months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cardiologist Nishant Shah explained winter can be especially
dangerous for those with underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Cold weather in general restricts our blood vessels,” said
Shah. “Someone at risk of heart disease or who has already blockages built up
in some of their heart blood vessels, with those blood vessels getting smaller,
it can certainly add more stress and strain on the heart, predisposing them to
heart attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Duke Health doctor shared respiratory viruses which peak
during winter months also aid to the usual rise in heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Doctors are currently cautioning North Carolinians to stay
home when sick due to the &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/covid-flu-rsv-spreading-north-carolina-dec-2024/"&gt;spread
of several respiratory viruses&lt;/a&gt;. An increase in hospitalizations has also
prompted Duke Health and UNC Health &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/duke-health-hospital-visitor-restriction-jan-2025/"&gt;systems
to implement visitor restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“People at risk of heart disease, or have had prior heart
attacks, run the risk of having a lot of inflammation in their blood vessels
due to respiratory illnesses which can also increase risk of heart attack,” shared
Shah. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah cautioned too much physical activity, such as shoveling
snow, can cause an at-risk individual to overdo it. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
							&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say you have someone who is used to mostly being
sedentary or someone who doesn’t do really a lot of intense work but has a lot
of medical conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, and
then they put themselves in the position where they’re doing more work than
their body is used to, that extra strain on their body can really be a lot,” the
doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A busy holiday season can also exaggerate stress along with
feelings of isolation and depression. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Stress can increase the amount of adrenaline,” explained
Shah. “That really puts a lot of demand on your heart. Excess stress can lead
to abnormal heart rhythms and it can lead to heart attacks as well as other
conditions that just will limit your heart from functioning at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While those with prior heart attacks are more at risk, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/young-adults-are-having-heart-attacks-more-often/21490464/"&gt;cardiac
arrest is happening more often in younger patients&lt;/a&gt; with seemingly no
obvious risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah says warning signs should be taken seriously and not
dismissed, especially if coming from a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
							&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“A common complaint I hear is, ‘I thought it was just acid
reflux’,” said Shah. “Women historically can present a-typically. If you look
at the science, women are often times missed when they’re having a heart
attack.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of heart attack can include: &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
chest pain&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
pain that radiates down the arm or jaw&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
shortness of breath&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
							&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
nausea &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
vomiting&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah said women may not always have the classic symptoms and
instead symptoms like back pain, abdominal discomfort or hiccups can be
indicators of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;If you or a loved one is exhibiting even mild symptoms of a potential
heart attack, the doctor encourages you to call 911 and take the idiom “Better
safe than sorry”, seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah highly encourages more people to become CPR-certified. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
							&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-cardiologists-warn-heart-attack-risk-cold-weather/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/what-is-cpr"&gt;The
American Heart Association reports&lt;/a&gt; immediate CPR can triple someone’s
chance of survival, especially for women.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The organization also reports men are 1.23X more likely to receive
CPR from a bystander and their survival rate is 23% higher compared to women.&lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah advised routine doctors visits, maintaining a healthy
diet, exercising appropriately, not smoking, and getting 7-9 hours of sleep are
crucial in reducing your risk of having a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;
						
						
						
					
					
				&lt;/div&gt;

But with less public knowledge around HMPV in the U.S., worries of a potential new pandemic have risen — though experts say there isn't need for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concern for a pandemic can be put at rest," &lt;a href="https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno,&lt;/a&gt; Children's Medical Center Plano director of infection prevention and control, told CBS News, adding not only is the virus fairly stable, it's also not a novel virus like COVID-19 was. "This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity against this human metapneumovirus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HMPV?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV is a virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of illness varies depending on the severity on an individual's case but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HMPV symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasal congestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections," the CDC's website notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is HMPV a new virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV is not new. It was first discovered in 2001 and is part of the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus, or &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-flu-contagious-period/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may have been circulating even earlier — for decades or over a century, Garcia Carreno said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., HMPV typically circulates beginning in the winter and lasts until or through spring, the CDC says, and can circulate simultaneously with RSV and the flu during the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is HMPV worse than COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern — it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;HMPV accounts for less than 2%&lt;/a&gt; of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia," the clinic's website adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HMPV transmission and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMPV is transmitted through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, compared to flu, RSV and COVID, we don't have a vaccine for human metapneumovirus, so we don't have that advantage of priming over or boosting our immune system to fight these viruses," said Garcia Carreno. "But still, everything else that we learned for COVID can apply to methane."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent illness, take similar steps to preventing other respiratory viruses, meaning wash hands with soap and water and avoid close contact with sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody's sick, try to avoid crowding so they don't expose everybody, especially the vulnerable people," said Garcia Carreno. "If that person is sick and can not avoid going to a place where other people are, then try to use a mask, use cough and sneezing etiquette and good hand washing."&lt;/p&gt;

Their findings reveal potential treatment strategies and emphasize the severe impact of poor diet on cellular health and cancer risk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Liver cells attempt to shut down as a defense mechanism against cancer, but this strategy is not particularly effective.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/ucsd/"&gt;University of California San Diego School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have provided new insights into the development of liver cancer, a disease that ranks as the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, highlights a complex relationship between cellular metabolism and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule composed of two long strands of nucleotides that coil around each other to form a double helix. It is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms that carries genetic instructions for development, functioning, growth, and reproduction. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; damage that fuels the progression of fatty liver disease into liver cancer. These findings open new avenues for preventing and treating liver cancer while deepening our understanding of how cancer develops and the impact of diet on DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)—the most prevalent type of liver cancer—have surged by 25–30%. A significant factor in this increase is the rising prevalence of fatty liver disease, which now affects 25% of adults in the United States. About 20% of individuals with fatty liver disease develop a more severe form called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which significantly raises the risk of HCC. Despite this, the mechanisms that drive the progression from MASH to liver cancer remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going from fatty liver disease to MASH to liver cancer is a very common scenario, and the consequences can be deadly,” said Michael Karin, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “When you have MASH, you either end up destroying your liver and then you need a new liver, or you progress to frequently fatal liver cancer, but we still don’t understand what’s happening at the subcellular level during this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DNA Damage and Cellular Senescence in Liver Cancer Development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a combination of mouse models and human tissue specimens and databases to demonstrate that MASH-inducing diets, which are rich in fat and sugar, cause DNA damage in liver cells that causes them to go into senescence, a state in which cells are still alive and metabolically active but can no longer divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senescence is a normal response to a variety of cellular stressors. In a perfect world, senescence gives the body time to repair damage or eliminate the damaged cells before they’re allowed to proliferate more widely and become cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_446635" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-446635" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-446635" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-777x418.jpg" alt="Mouse Liver Cancer Cells" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-777x418.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-400x215.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-768x413.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-150x81.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells-450x242.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mouse-Liver-Cancer-Cells.jpg 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-446635" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;These images show slices of mouse liver under the microscope, with tumors outlined in yellow and green indicating the expression of different proteins within cells. The left column is a control group. In the center column, the protein detected (TBG-Cre) is expressed in all liver cells, so the entire image appears green. In the right column, the protein detected (p21-Cre) is only expressed in senescent liver cells. Because green is only visible within the tumor area, the results show that liver tumors originate from previously senescent liver cells.

&lt;p&gt;However, as the researchers discovered, this isn’t what happens in liver cells, also known as hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, some damaged cells survive this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cells are, according to Karin, “like ticking time bombs that could start proliferating again at any point and ultimately become cancerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Comprehensive genomic analyses of tumor DNA indicate that they originate from liver cells damaged by MASH, emphasizing a direct link between diet-induced DNA damage and the development of cancer,” added study co-author Ludmil Alexandrov, Ph.D., associate professor of cellular and molecular medicine and bioengineering at UC San Diego and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential Therapeutic Approaches and Insights on Aging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that developing new drugs to prevent or reverse DNA damage could be a promising therapeutic approach for preventing liver cancer, particularly in people with MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a few possibilities for how this could be leveraged into a future treatment, but it will take more time and research to explore these ideas,” said Karin. “One hypothesis is that a high-fat diet could lead to an imbalance in the raw materials our cells use to build and repair DNA, and that we could use drugs or nutri-chemicals to correct these imbalances. Another idea is developing new antioxidants, much more efficient and specific than the ones we have now, and using those could help block or reverse the cellular stress that causes DNA damage in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to opening these new avenues of treatment for liver cancer, the study also offers new insight into the relationship between aging and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that aging increases the risk of virtually all cancers and that aging is associated with cellular senescence, but this introduces a paradox since senescence is supposed to guard against cancer,” said Karin. “This study helps reveal the underlying molecular biology that allows cells to re-enter the cell cycle after undergoing senescence, and we believe that similar mechanisms could be acting in a wide range of cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also help directly quantify the detrimental effects of poor diet on cellular metabolism which, according to Karin, could be used to help guide public health messaging related to fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A poor, fast-food diet can be as dangerous as cigarette smoking in the long run,” said Karin. “People need to understand that bad diets do far more than just alter a person’s cosmetic appearance. They can fundamentally change how our cells function, right down to their DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a story all too many people know: You wake up with a stomachache and soon find yourself stuck in the bathroom, battling nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. Within a day or two, everyone in the house is showing the same symptoms. These fast-spreading bouts of gastrointestinal distress are often caused by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42944-what-is-norovirus.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42944-what-is-norovirus.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;norovirus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, colloquially known as the "stomach bug" or "stomach flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is highly contagious and the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The virus spreads easily through direct contact with an infected person or with contaminated surfaces, even after the infected person's symptoms have passed. Though cases tend to rise in fall and winter when people gather indoors in close quarters, anyone can contract norovirus at any time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutralizing, or "killing," any norovirus that ends up on people's hands or on surfaces helps to curb the spread of the illness. So what's the best way to kill norovirus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of the virus,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nfid.org/person/robert-h-hopkins-jr-md/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nfid.org/person/robert-h-hopkins-jr-md/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Live Science. Cleaning hard surfaces, such as countertops, with bleach-based solutions can also neutralize the virus and thus prevent it from spreading to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/61949-norovirus-prevention-math.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/61949-norovirus-prevention-math.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's the best way to protect yourself from a norovirus outbreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one common cleanser doesn't work against norovirus: alcohol-based hand sanitizer. That's because alcohol-based cleansers are only effective against certain types of viruses, known as "enveloped" viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/53272-what-is-a-virus.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/53272-what-is-a-virus.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;viruses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contain genetic material — namely, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — wrapped in a protein coating called a capsid. Some viruses, such as the culprits behind &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influenza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/coronavirus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/coronavirus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;COVID-19&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also have a protective outer "envelope" called a phospholipid bilayer, which is similar to the membrane that surrounds human cells. Without this envelope, these viruses can't attach to or infect host cells. Alcohol-based cleansers neutralize viruses by interfering with that outer envelope, rendering the virus inert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-G9VibebRgZN8MUNxYT59cR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-G9VibebRgZN8MUNxYT59cR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alcohol-based hand sanitizers, cleaners and cleansing wipes &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; work against non-enveloped viruses, such as norovirus. Non-enveloped viruses don't have or need a phospholipid bilayer, and they can survive much longer on surfaces without invading a host cell. (Norovirus can survive for days or weeks on surfaces, depending on the surface type.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohols can't break through the protein capsid of these viruses as easily as they do phospholipid bilayers, so neutralizing non-enveloped viruses requires different cleansers, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/norovirus-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/norovirus-factsheet.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;soap or bleach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a person washes their hands, the soap surrounds the viral particles and physically washes them off the skin. "Soap itself is very effective at disrupting capsules of almost any type of cell. If you put enough soap on your skin, you're going to break the skin barrier. Same with bleach,” Hopkins said. That's why frequent handwashing can sometimes lead to dry skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning surfaces requires an even stronger cleanser, such as bleach, to completely inactivate the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once someone contracts norovirus, they have to let the infection run its course — there are no available antiviral treatments for it, and antibiotics won't help because they treat bacterial infections, not viral ones.&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that people who catch the stomach bug drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and stay away from others while they're sick, as well as for two days after their symptoms resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we don't have specific antivirals, then I think it's even more important that we do what we can to prevent infections, rather than having to treat those symptoms," Hopkins told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and others from norovirus,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;the CDC recommends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; frequent handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom, before preparing or handling food, and before and after caring for someone who is sick. If a family member or roommate falls ill, disinfect contaminated surfaces with a bleach solution and wash soiled clothing in hot water.

Researchers with the University of Copenhagen found that children with a high versus low burden of infection between birth and 3 years of age were more likely to have moderate to severe infections and to receive antibiotic treatment by ages 10 and 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the findings are useful for the prognosis and follow-up of young children who have a high burden of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High versus low infection burden&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Danish population-based Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) birth cohort, the researchers analyzed daily symptom and medication diaries completed by parents of children ages 0 to 3 years, supported by both scheduled and acute visits to the COPSAC clinic. Infections of interest included colds, gastroenteritis, fever episodes, acute otitis media (earache), tonsilitis, and pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined data on diagnoses and prescriptions at scheduled clinical visits until February 2024, when the children had reached the age 10- or 13-year planned clinical visit. The incidence of moderate to severe infections and systemic antibiotics after age 3 was estimated using adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRRs). The analysis was adjusted for social and environmental confounders, including sex, social circumstances, delivery mode, and maternal age, education and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 700 children included in the study, 614 had daily diary infection data from birth to 3 years available. Among these children, there was a mean of 16.4 infections, with colds the most frequent infection identified. After age 3, the 614 children experienced 268 moderate to severe infections, primarily pneumonia (77.6%), with a mean of 2.32 antibiotic treatments per child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal cohort study suggests that early-life infection burden may continue throughout childhood and is associated with later antibiotic treatments independent of social and environmental risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared children who'd had 16 or more infections by age 3 (high burden) with those who'd had 15 or fewer (low burden), they found a more than twofold higher risk of moderate to severe infection after age 3 in the high-burden group (181 vs 87 episodes; AIRR, 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52 to 3.89] and an increased risk of systemic antibiotic treatments (799 vs 632 episodes; AIRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis also found that, even in children who weren't in the high-burden group, each infection listed in the diary increased the later risk of moderate to severe infections (AIRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02 to1.08) and systemic antibiotic treatments (AIRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04). Subtype analyses showed significant associations between each cold, acute otitis media, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and fever episode between birth and 3 years and increased risk of later moderate to severe infections or systemic antibiotic treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early infection load and later risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This longitudinal cohort study suggests that early-life infection burden may continue throughout childhood and is associated with later antibiotic treatments independent of social and environmental risk factors," the study authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also note that, in addition to their findings, other studies have found links between early childhood infection burden and the development of asthma, allergies, cardiometabolic risk factors, and mental disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important for all pediatricians to discuss these disease trajectories associated with early-life infections with families, knowing that a high infection load in the first years of life may increase the risk of infections in later childhood and a range of other chronic disorders later in life," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 4-5
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Sugary drinks may leave a sour taste given their possible impact on mortality, according to a new study. "This is a public health crisis, requiring urgent action," said the study's senior author, Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed global data on sugar-sweetened beverages consumed around the world, observational and randomized studies, and both diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the evidence, researchers created a comparative risk model and estimated that sugary drinks "cause more than 330,000 annual deaths from diabetes and cardiovascular disease," Mozaffarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is particularly serious in Latin America and the Caribbean, which had the largest number of cardiovascular disease cases related to beverages, and sub-Saharan Africa, which also had the most cases of Type 2 diabetes from sugary drinks, he added, based on the researchers' model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined the demographics of those most affected by sweetened drinks — namely, younger male adults with higher education in urban areas, said Toby Smithson, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a senior manager at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's time to pay attention to, and take priority actions to deal with, this tragic preventable suffering," Mozaffarian said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why liquid sugar is so fast-acting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the study did not test a behavior or intervention against a control group, the new study's researchers can't say that the sugar sweetened beverages are causing diabetes and cardiovascular disease — they can only estimate the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected valuable data across 184 countries, but the study did not factor in all income levels and the increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among high-risk ethnic groups, Smithson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the finding of sugary beverages as harmful makes sense, as many studies have shown a link between such drinks and poor health impacts, Mozaffarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Liquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Suzanne Janzi, Lund University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages have "empty calories" — or calories without any nutritional benefits, Smithson said. They are also a source of fast-acting carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream and raise blood sugar quickly, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These empty sugars in liquid form are even more harmful than those in desserts or sweet foods, Suzanne Janzi, a doctoral student in nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, said previously. She was not part of the most recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods," Janzi said in an email. "Solid sugars are often part of foods that contain other nutrients like fiber, proteins, and fats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those nutrients slow digestion, meaning there is a more gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fats, fiber and proteins in solid food leave you feeling fuller longer, liquid sugars often don't fill you up, which can lead to appetite dysregulation and the consumption of too many calories, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Different sources of added sugars also vary in their consumption patterns, which could further explain why they associate differently with cardiovascular disease risk," Janzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are alternative sweeteners the answer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about drinks that are sweetened with something other than sugar? They might be better, but they aren't the answer, Mozaffarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Growing research shows that both natural and artificial low-calorie sweeteners are not innocuous and may cause health harms, so these should be considered a short-term, less harmful alternative, not a long-term solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, artificial sweeteners might be a good substitute in moderation for people with diabetes, who may be accustomed to sugary drinks, Smithson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By providing a diabetes-friendly way to prepare foods people are used to eating, we can meet people where they are in offering support to effectively manage their diabetes," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of relying on artificial sweeteners, Mozaffarian advises switching to unsweetened drinks all together, such as seltzer, unsweetened tea or coffee, or just plain water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is important for managing blood pressure, blood sugar, internal temperature and digestion, Smithson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best hydrating beverage is water," she said in an email. "If a person doesn't like plain water, they can jazz up their beverage by drinking infused water with slices of lemon, lime, or fresh herbs, or using sparkling waters that contain no added sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Of 13 patients studied, five experienced sustained improvements, while others reported temporary or no benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complexity underscores the challenge of treating long Covid, a condition with over 200 symptoms ranging from brain fog to respiratory issues. Researchers emphasize the need for more targeted studies to determine which patients might benefit most from antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Five of 13 patients had sustained improvements in long Covid symptoms after extended Paxlovid treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Covid Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The condition affects 1 in 13 adults in the U.S., with over 200 reported symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Research Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies aim to identify biological mechanisms and patient-specific responses to treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An extended course of Paxlovid appears to help some patients with long Covid, according to a case series by UC San Francisco researchers that suggests this treatment option holds promise for some of those struggling with debilitating symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results are at odds with recent research that has failed to show the antiviral can alleviate persistent symptoms of the disease. The authors said more study is needed to find out which patients may benefit from the drug and how long it should be given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107355"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a man's head and the covid virus." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/paxlovid-long-covid-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Three months later, he took it for 15 days and reported that both his cognitive and his physical symptoms improved. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 17.6 million Americans, or 1 in 13 adults, have long Covid. These individuals experience symptoms for months or even years after their initial Covid-19 infection that range from brain fog and headaches to respiratory and cardiovascular issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are about five years into the pandemic, and yet there are not yet any federally-approved treatments for long Covid,” said Alison Cohen, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at UCSF and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a silver bullet, but it may help a lot of people in a meaningful way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study appears Jan. 6 in the &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;publication &lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews with patients reveal the drug helps some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a randomized controlled clinical trial of a 15-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, the drug combination marketed as Paxlovid, concluded that it was safe, although it did not lessen long Covid symptoms. The researchers noted that further research may show benefits for people with specific symptoms or at different doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCSF team collaborated with long Covid patients, some of whom are members of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a group of people with long Covid and other associated chronic conditions who are also researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a closer look at what happened when people took a longer course of Paxlovid to see if it might work in people with specific symptoms or at different times in their disease. They also examined the experiences of people who contracted different strains of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that five of the 13 patients in the study experienced sustained improvements in their symptoms. Others experienced temporary reprieves; and some had no improvement. Treatment lengths varied, but many took Paxlovid for 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a 56-year-old man who developed long Covid at the start of the pandemic was plagued for more than two years with fatigue, headaches, photosensitivity, brain fog, exercise intolerance, elevated heart rate and joint pain. He took Paxlovid for five days in September of 2022 with no change in his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months later, he took it for 15 days and reported that both his cognitive and his physical symptoms improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a 45-year-old woman who developed long Covid in January of 2022 experienced fatigue, breathing difficulties, chest pain, weight loss and migraines for months after her infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-day course of Paxlovid in October of 2022 gave her a three-day reprieve from her symptoms. But when she took a 15-day course the following month, it did not affect her symptoms at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 200 symptoms ascribed to the condition, long Covid has remained difficult to define, diagnose or treat. Researchers are still trying to understand the biological mechanisms that underlie the disorder; and UCSF has launched the world’s first long Covid tissue bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’ve learned one thing over the last four years, it’s that long Covid is complex, and figuring out why some people benefit so remarkably from antiviral treatment while others don’t is one of the most important questions for the field,” said study co-author Michael Peluso, MD, principal investigator of the UCSF long COVID research program and an infectious disease researcher in the UCSF School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to need to embrace that complexity to get answers for the millions of people suffering from this condition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional co-authors are associated with the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a group of long Covid patients and individuals with associated illnesses who are also researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;  The authors received no funding for this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Long COVID and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f79666c7b607d666e216c60636366796a7d4f7a6c7c69216a6b7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Victoria Colliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Victoria Colliver – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-024-00668-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in established Long COVID: a case series&lt;/a&gt;” by Alison Cohen et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in established Long COVID: a case series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (&amp;gt;5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11) of and within (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 21:41:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE1IWG8xOXNCZFViX0tuaC01NFlVYkJHSVdfZ0l2ckJZbV8tNUF1U1h5MmdSaFpETFVNUWRRZVByMFctUG5rZ1ViY01UUTh5UXBlaHo1R0w0QXkwaHdTcFN4dExlNEkxdw</guid></item><item><title>Big Agriculture Is Leading Us Into the Bird Flu Abyss - Truthout</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPdjA3MHZ2cFRRZGd0bjRGMFhjWklTQjJkVUI3VGZpRFQwQms4UHB1RnZjOXAtYVNLRDJrVjhIakI4SFRwd3NzSEEyOXpuZHBxc3NnUU1YSUZoRDBseGx6XzFkSkxaLU9XYm1QcVk1NzIya1d6Z2pzRDhTVGM0RmVxSTN4alNBV3pyb2FXNg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContent" class="ar__con order-3 col-12 col-lg-7 mt-3 px-md-6"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might have just rung in a new year, but it feels like an epidemiological Groundhog Day. Nearly five years since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, public health experts are once again sounding the alarm. This time, it’s the H5N1 virus — also known as avian influenza, or bird flu — that’s causing concern. Even though federal officials have had ample time to stymie the spread, the last 10 months have seen the virus jump virtually unabated from state to state, infecting cattle herds, poultry, pigs and people. There’s still no proof that bird flu can be transmitted between humans, but if the virus continues on its current trajectory, experts &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-spread-cattle-poultry-pandemic-cdc/"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that we could be facing a devastating pandemic of COVID-19 proportions, at minimum. And, just as in 2020, the U.S. stands to face the next major viral outbreak with none other than President Donald J. Trump at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It didn’t have to be this way. H5N1, which has been around for decades, was first observed infecting humans in 1997. But last March marked a new turning point: The U.S. reported its first confirmed bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle. Since mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus is rare, its spread among cows raised immediate red flags for epidemiologists. Still, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched a containment effort that critics called slow and fragmented. Within a month, more than 30 dairy herds across eight states had tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, Zeynep Tufekci, a Princeton University professor who wrote a series of columns on the government’s poor COVID-19 response in 2020 and 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/bird-flu-cow-outbreak.html"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a new op-ed titled, “This May Be Our Last Chance to Halt Bird Flu in Humans, and We Are Blowing It.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="truth-44dfda0789a4fa70dfb34841f6ae1675 truth-post-content-high" id="truth-44dfda0789a4fa70dfb34841f6ae1675"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a fine line between one person and 10 people with H5N1,” Rick Bright, an immunologist who served on President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board, told Tufekci at the time. “By the time we’ve detected 10, it’s probably too late.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of January 3, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 66 bird flu cases in humans. One person in the U.S. has died after being infected, according to state officials in Louisiana, where the patient was hospitalized. At least 915 dairy herds across 16 states have now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html#:~:text=Data,avian%20influenza%20A(H5N1)."&gt;tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus. In October, the first known bird flu infection in a pig was reported in Oregon. In late December, an animal sanctuary in Washington went into &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/26/nx-s1-5239841/bird-flu-kills-20-cats-washington-sanctuary"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt; after the virus killed 20 big cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent in-depth reporting from &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News &lt;/em&gt;provided a disturbing &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-spread-cattle-poultry-pandemic-cdc/"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; of how the U.S. has stumbled headfirst into another public health emergency, thanks in large part to the federal government’s deference to agriculture industry interests. Fearing financial setbacks from lost milk production, many farmers declined to test their herds when the outbreak began, monitor their employees for illness or allow health officials to inspect their herds. Farmworkers told &lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt; they’d received scant information on protective gear and testing. When the USDA &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; permitted on farms, officials &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/bird-flu-cow-outbreak.html"&gt;dragged their feet&lt;/a&gt; when sharing information with scientists from the genome testing, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the USDA didn’t announce a federal mandate to test milk for bird flu until December — months after the virus had already taken hold of hundreds of dairy farms. “The agriculture community has dictated the rules of engagement from the start,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told &lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, Big Ag may be leading us into the bird flu abyss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agriculture industry, after all, has a substantial voice in the U.S. government. From 2023 to 2024, agribusiness PACs contributed nearly $30 million to political candidates, according to &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/industry-detail/A/2024"&gt;OpenSecrets data&lt;/a&gt;, and the industry’s trade groups spent more than $130.5 million lobbying the federal government. More than half of registered agribusiness lobbyists in 2024 were former &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/sectors/summary?cycle=2024&amp;amp;id=a"&gt;government employees&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon known as the revolving door. Biden’s Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, who previously served in the position under President Barack Obama, has also received scrutiny as a “revolver.” In between his two stints as USDA head, Vilsack &lt;a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/11/ag-secretary-tom-vilsack-deflects-on-future-career-plans-regulatory-revolving-door/"&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; a dairy industry lobbying position, receiving a salary of nearly $1 million as vice president of Dairy Management, Inc. When asked by reporters at the World Dairy Expo in October, Vilsack did not rule out another potential stint as a dairy lobbyist after he leaves office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the bird flu fire is the stand-off between federal agencies and state agriculture officials. Despite the USDA’s lax approach, some states have pushed back against federal intervention. “They need to back off,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/bird-flu-dairy-farms-cdc-00156119"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May, referring to the CDC’s efforts to track and contain the virus on Texas farms. Texas, the first state where bird flu was detected in dairy herds, didn’t invite the CDC to conduct epidemiological field studies, and Miller, a former rodeo cowboy, was considered a frontrunner for Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture. In mid-November, as the bird flu crisis continued to worsen across U.S. dairy farms, Miller published an op-ed on the Texas Department of Agriculture’s website &lt;a href="https://texasagriculture.gov/News-Events/Article/10214/OPINION-RAW-MILK-WORTH-THE-RISK-WE-SHOULD-GET-TO-DECIDE"&gt;criticizing&lt;/a&gt; the government’s regulation of raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​There’s nothing more American than the freedom to choose what kind of food you eat,” Miller wrote. “The government should educate and inform about potential risks but leave it to the people to decide what is best for them and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sale of raw milk — milk that hasn’t undergone the pasteurization process, which kills harmful bacteria and viruses such as bird flu — is banned in 20 states. While the dairy product has seen a surge of interest in recent years, particularly among anti-establishment &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/12/23/why-conservatives-are-now-obsessed-with-raw-milk/"&gt;conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, health experts overwhelmingly say that the potential harms outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;California, which allows the retail sale of raw milk, has already announced two recalls after detecting bird flu in commercial samples. The last thing that the U.S. needs amid a burgeoning dairy industry-fueled public health crisis is raw milk deregulation. And so it’s deeply depressing that Trump has picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a raw milk proponent and vaccine skeptic — to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency that oversees the various entities key to combatting public health crises, including the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the head of one of the California raw milk farms at the center of a bird flu recall said that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-05/raw-farm-ceo-reportedly-encouraged-to-apply-for-fda-position"&gt;encouraged&lt;/a&gt; him to apply for a position within the FDA. Mark McAfee, the chief executive of Raw Farm, told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;in December that, at RFK Jr.’s request, he had applied for the position of “FDA advisor on raw milk policy and standards development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bungled bird flu response cuts deep because the COVID-19 pandemic was so recent — and its effects continue to linger. Trump was rightly condemned for his mishandling of that public health emergency. In fact, Bright — the top vaccine scientist who spoke to Tufekci about bird flu last April — was ousted by Trump from his role as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the agency responsible for fighting emerging pandemics, in April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following year, Bright &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/05/850960344/rick-bright-former-top-vaccine-scientist-files-whistleblower-complaint"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; a whistleblower complaint he’d filed against Trump’s HHS. Bright alleged he had been demoted as an act of retaliation, after he had declined to promote unproven COVID-19 treatments like hydroxychloroquine, and after his early warnings to the Trump administration about the pandemic were ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has failed to mount what experts would call a formidable or adequate response to the bird flu outbreak. Even more concerning, though, is that Trump’s all-too-recent record shows us he’s unlikely to do any better.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers developed new in vitro and cell models to study how membrane anchoring inhibits these harmful transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that while anchoring stabilizes prion proteins, pre-formed aggregates can still induce clumping, suggesting a mechanism relevant to infectious prion diseases. These findings provide critical insights into protein misfolding and may inform therapeutic strategies for prion and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipid Anchors Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Membrane anchors stabilize prion proteins, preventing pathological aggregation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-formed aggregates can induce clumping of anchored prion proteins, relevant to infectious prion diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding protein stabilization could aid in developing treatments for prion and related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein aggregation is typical of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases such as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team headed by Professor Jörg Tatzelt from the Department of Biochemistry of Neurodegenerative Diseases at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, has now used new in vitro and cell culture models to show that a lipid anchor on the outer membrane of nerve cells inhibits the aggregation of the prion protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107351"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a rendition of proteins clumping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/lipids-protein-aggregation-cjd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;3D reconstruction of a microscope image: red is the membrane and green is clumped prion protein.

They are associated with the transformation of the cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) from its healthy fold into pathological aggregates, i.e. scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;). While such diseases are rare in humans, hereditary prion diseases are triggered by genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some gene mutations affect the anchoring of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; to the cell membrane. However, it is still not fully understood exactly how these changes can trigger prion diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to gain new insights into the underlying processes, the researchers have developed new models to explore the role of a membrane anchor on the folding and aggregation of PrP in vitro and in neuronal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments showed that anchoring to membranes stabilizes the folding of PrP and effectively inhibits aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s interesting is that the clumping of membrane-anchored PrP could be induced by pre-formed protein aggregates,” says Jörg Tatzelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a mechanism that might play a role in infectious prion diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the German Research Foundation: TA 167/6-3, WI/2111-6 and Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation (RESOLV, EXC 2033–390677874).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e18b8e849386cf9580959b848d95a193948993cc948f88cc838e8289948ccf8584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jörg Tatzelt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ruhr-uni-bochum.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jörg Tatzelt – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to AG Tatzelt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2415250121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Topological Confinement by a Membrane Anchor Suppresses Phase Separation into Protein Aggregates: Implications for Prion Diseases&lt;/a&gt;” by Jörg Tatzelt et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topological Confinement by a Membrane Anchor Suppresses Phase Separation into Protein Aggregates: Implications for Prion Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein misfolding and aggregation are a hallmark of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms driving protein misfolding in the cellular context are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that the two-dimensional confinement imposed by a membrane anchor stabilizes the native protein conformation and suppresses liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and protein aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inherited prion diseases in humans and neurodegeneration in transgenic mice are linked to the expression of anchorless prion protein (PrP), suggesting that the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of native PrP impedes spontaneous formation of neurotoxic and infectious PrP species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining unique in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that anchoring to membranes prevents LLPS and spontaneous aggregation of PrP. Upon release from the membrane, PrP undergoes a conformational transition to detergent-insoluble aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates an essential role of the GPI anchor in preventing spontaneous misfolding of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; and provides a mechanistic basis for inherited prion diseases associated with anchorless PrP.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 21:11:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOdXRITzFzU1BqTUJaT25waGtiSV9Pd0NWbEVSSFZCMzJ1YlhiMm9rS1JPMnpsc2NEeXMtOFQ3dHh5ZWFqdEI3TVFsV1dMdmsxRldlVFJWanY2bWZxbU9wb0J0cDhIb2RrSFN6R1lyZk9nWkItZ0JwVWhYMmw0Z0FHWEdJQnk3ZW03QllB0gGQAUFVX3lxTE8wZDNUM0J4c3A0TUNPclpqVjBBaUNkRkx6N0pLeXZkZy1POUwwYVRfSUtHTTM4MUZERjRFaVBfQ3ZjcXNiWURpRnF1TmE3eVpDeXF4czV0M0IxM05uSTFTTWNVRWFfbFpTQmtpQWtnZENXTG5aa21mdW9xVkRrRXRnQTIxdGhuM1F5Rk5KRktWZg</guid></item><item><title>LDH reports first U.S. H5N1-related human death - Louisiana Department of Health - Louisiana.gov</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSkFVX3lxTE1hTnlXS0RvT0tBSHRoOFd1SGtzZmtTVFNDWTd3Q3Y5UXotODB6RjVoQXhlejRBYnF2RU80cnZnRllKS3A1R1BfeWN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSkFVX3lxTE1hTnlXS0RvT0tBSHRoOFd1SGtzZmtTVFNDWTd3Q3Y5UXotODB6RjVoQXhlejRBYnF2RU80cnZnRllKS3A1R1BfeWN3?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;LDH reports first U.S. H5N1-related human death&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Louisiana Department of Health - Louisiana.gov&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRHNacUlpbEMtZkgxRG1MdVA0VGhNbGQ3V1BtZmZwQU5Db2I2eUdLRU5uQU0xaUNiOVN4MGJBb2R6UWNpeE5rWms3cTEwU1RJVHJrWlVPZG9aSm5LT2lBVVk5ZllfZndrek9jbGcxZnRCV0dmSlQ0ZGswT1VJWFdEUS1uamJtaDRDWFRyeTFfblBYWDBDcDNQTjQyN0Y?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;First bird flu death reported in the U.S., according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;NPR&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNSWt6WFRBSkxiVWwtaGNpeDlydHd3QkFiekN3Q0JrMy1jUXJlMldSXzlmUnVscGprS3YwSUo4cGY1WGx0Q3pEMXhNT3huMlh0NjNiZHZ5bXhfM2pmbk1GX05mb2ZQWjVVMWRHbmFBMHNKTl9LRWktcmp5STZvX0JWRkk4VTN4b2JBY2dJSkxmOERIWXFJZ3RISWw5NDg?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;State health officials report first avian flu death&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;KATC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxQWFlkOWhTeWNxUDRTTFJ5VXRJSF9mWDc1S2xBZ2ZrMEUyMHNoZVhMQTRkVUtUcElsTWp0QkdneGR3RnRHQlJkRHJwd1FWYm9xZ0hqejVzR1FaRDZzeWFDT2U1Y1Q0TzhEc2hxa3lhdjFnRHJUbmRKaFJINjBoa2xGdHZVZmljVXg5ZTBOU2kxUmJNbjNFSGpnUjJBREdCZWQ0bURCVVFzSkRpamJWbTJ6eW8ybmhSZWVFQUFrcHlWZzc2NlZPS2pROG9fXzVjUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;‘Worrisome’ mutations found in H5N1 bird flu virus isolated from Canadian teenager&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxQWkU0bjhoWmo5eUVnc0VPSmF4T1FMdHM5VzBXWDc3ZVFTNVNhWjJLZHBRR1M0T1pNX0F4OUlrQm9UVnVSQ3BhZXExUWwyVnBxbHdhQ0QtbjltRjlmLUZ0anFTcVliWVY2aGIyUkkzeHNVMlpYVHZ5SVNiVTU0VkowbElGdUVHOEpzNHdrT0hPaEZDTEJPUHZjSS1sSXphNHRxamR4MklpRG1tVWp4THNWWEhtNjd0d0N3Rnhhd1FQZXRjckw0MjlaNnhDUV8?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Why The U.S. Could Be Making The Same Mistakes With Bird Flu As It Did With COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>Louisiana Department of Health - Louisiana.gov</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 20:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiSkFVX3lxTE1hTnlXS0RvT0tBSHRoOFd1SGtzZmtTVFNDWTd3Q3Y5UXotODB6RjVoQXhlejRBYnF2RU80cnZnRllKS3A1R1BfeWN3</guid></item><item><title>The Genetic Impact of Forever Chemicals on Brain Function - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9iTDNKZTJlT0hnRklTcDVpeUdaMF9HQkw0c2F3WUd6TDV0RkpzLVNWdUJBQ0NKeDhUb284MVdCYXFYMk5UMDN2LTFhVWdaaHpzUjl1X1FLbkwybDhiUmdBMjdrOWdaSWoycFRpYUtSX1V6em42S3NF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have found that per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) alter the expression of specific genes in brain-like cells, potentially contributing to neurotoxicity. Among six tested compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) caused the most significant changes, downregulating genes crucial for neuron survival and upregulating those linked to cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite shared chemical traits, PFAS vary widely in their biological effects, making it critical to study each compound individually. These findings may help identify genetic markers for PFAS exposure and prioritize safer alternatives to phase out harmful compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Expression Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; PFAS exposure alters over 700 genes, affecting neuronal function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Harmful Compound:&lt;/strong&gt; PFOA significantly impacts genes linked to synaptic growth and neuron survival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marker Genes Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Eleven genes consistently respond to all six tested PFAS, suggesting use as exposure markers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University at Buffalo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) earn their “forever chemical” moniker by persisting in water, soil and even the human brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain tissue makes PFAS particularly concerning, but the underlying mechanism of their neurotoxicity needs to be studied further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107347"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/forever-chemicals-genetics-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Taken together, this suggests that distinct molecular structures within each type of PFAS drives changes in gene expression. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, a new study by University at Buffalo researchers has identified 11 genes that may hold the key to understanding the brain’s response to these pervasive chemicals commonly found in everyday items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genes, some involved in processes vital for neuronal health, were found to be consistently affected by PFAS exposure, either expressing more or less, regardless of the type of PFAS compounds tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, all compounds caused a gene key for neuronal cell survival to express less, and another gene linked to neuronal cell death to express more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate these genes may be markers to detect and monitor PFAS-induced neurotoxicity in the future,” says lead co-corresponding author G. Ekin Atilla-Gokcumen, PhD, Dr. Marjorie E. Winkler Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry, within the UB College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the study, published in the Dec. 18 issue of &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience,&lt;/em&gt; found hundreds more genes whose expression changed in different directions based on the compound tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, there was no correlation between the level at which PFAS accumulates in a cell and the extent to which it causes differential gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, this suggests that distinct molecular structures within each type of PFAS drives changes in gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PFAS, despite sharing certain chemical characteristics, come in different shapes and sizes, leading to variability in their biological effects. Thus, knowledge on how our own biology reacts to the different types of PFAS is of major biomedical relevance,” says the study’s other co-corresponding author, Diana Aga, PhD, SUNY Distinguished Professor and Henry M. Woodburn Chair in the Department of Chemistry, and director of the UB RENEW Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on their chain length or headgroup, PFAS can have very different effects on cells,” Atilla-Gokcumen adds. “We should not be viewing them as one large class of compounds, but really as compounds that we need to investigate individually.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors include Omer Gokcumen, PhD, professor in the Department of Biological Sciences. The study was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ups and downs of gene expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS aren’t immediately toxic. We’re exposed to them practically every day, including through drinking water and food packaging, and don’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, researchers need to find points of assessment further upstream in the cellular process than just whether a cell lives or dies,” Atilla-Gokcumen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team decided to focus on how PFAS affects the gene expression of neuronal-like cells, as well as how PFAS affects lipids, which are molecules that help make up the cell membrane, among other important functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to different PFAS for 24 hours resulted in modest but distinct changes in lipids, and over 700 genes to express differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six types of PFAS tested, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) — once commonly used in nonstick pans and recently deemed hazardous by the EPA — was by far the most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its small uptake, PFOA altered the expression of almost 600 genes — no other compound altered more than 147. Specifically, PFOA decreased the expression of genes involved in synaptic growth and neural function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the six compounds caused changes in biological pathways involved in hypoxia signaling, oxidative stress, protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism, all of which are crucial for neuronal function and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven of the genes were found to express the same way, either more or less, to all six compounds. One of the genes that was consistently downregulated was mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor, which is important for the survival of neuronal cells and has been shown to reverse symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the genes consistently upregulated was thioredoxin interacting protein, which has been linked to neuronal cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of these 11 genes exhibited consistent regulation across all PFAS that we tested. This uniform response suggests that they may serve as promising markers for assessing PFAS exposure, but further research is needed to know how these genes respond to other types of PFAS,” Atilla-Gokcumen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying the least-worst options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As harmful as PFAS can be, the reality is that good substitutes have yet to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compounds can perhaps be replaced in applications like food packaging, but their effectiveness in firefighting and semiconductor manufacturing, for example, may need to continue long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why studies like this are crucial, Atilla-Gokcumen says. The varied reaction most genes had to different compounds, as well as the lack of correlation between PFAS uptake into cells and the extent of gene change expression they cause, underscores just how unique each of these compounds are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we understand why some PFAS are more harmful than others, we can prioritize phasing out the worst offenders while seeking safer substitutes. For example, alternatives like short-chain PFAS are being explored, as they tend to persist less in the environment and accumulate less in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, their reduced persistence may come at the cost of effectiveness in certain applications, and there are concerns about potential unknown health effects that require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research is needed to ensure these substitutes are genuinely safer and effective for specific applications,” Atilla-Gokcumen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is a major step towards achieving this goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81f5e7e5e8efeae8c1e3f4e7e7e0edeeafe4e5f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tom Dinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://buffalo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University at Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tom Dinki – University at Buffalo&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.4c00652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Investigating the Mechanism of Neurotoxic Effects of PFAS in Differentiated Neuronal Cells through Transcriptomics and Lipidomics Analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Marjorie E.

Increasing evidence links PFAS to neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms of their effects on neuronal function remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we utilized SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, differentiated into neuronal-like cells, to investigate the impact of six PFAS compounds─perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorodecanesulfonic acid (PFDS), 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (8:2 FTS), and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH)─on neuronal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a 30 μM exposure for 24 h, PFAS accumulation ranged from 40–6500 ng/mg of protein. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across treatments (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), with 11 DEGs shared among all PFAS exposures, indicating potential biomarkers for neuronal PFAS toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFOA-treated cells showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic growth and neural function, while PFOS, PFDS, 8:2 FTS, and 8:2 FTOH exposures resulted in the upregulation of genes related to hypoxia response and amino acid metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipidomic profiling further demonstrated significant increases in fatty acid levels with PFDA, PFDS, and 8:2 FTS and depletion of triacylglycerols with 8:2 FTOH treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the neurotoxic effects of PFAS are structurally dependent, offering insights into the molecular processes that may drive PFAS-induced neuronal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 20:05:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9iTDNKZTJlT0hnRklTcDVpeUdaMF9HQkw0c2F3WUd6TDV0RkpzLVNWdUJBQ0NKeDhUb284MVdCYXFYMk5UMDN2LTFhVWdaaHpzUjl1X1FLbkwybDhiUmdBMjdrOWdaSWoycFRpYUtSX1V6em42S3NF</guid></item><item><title>Lead Poisoning May Have Made Ancient Romans a Bit Less Intelligent - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNQ3pNNTJPcUJkSjF3TzhabUVnbTU0Z05sY2dwaWh1V01mcUJNN19OdDlvSVloMWFvS0VxdE5EdER4NzhXNUVDRVg1b2pyOHEtcG01eWlPT0Y2eUpJX2ZJTzR0STY3UHk3cUx3OFd2RnRGMWtMTmVPRmpxYUdfSUtyOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Roughly 2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire was flourishing. But something sinister was in the air. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Widespread pollution in the form of airborne lead was taking a toll on health and intelligence, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2419630121" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;researchers reported on Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the roughly two centuries starting in 27 B.C., a period of relative stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, the empire extended throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Its economy relied on silver coinage, which required huge mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But extracting silver from the Earth creates a whole lot of lead, said Joseph McConnell, an environmental scientist at the Desert Research Institute, a nonprofit group based in Nevada, and the lead author of the new research. “If you produce an ounce of silver, you’d have produced something like 10,000 ounces of lead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And lead has a host of negative effects on the human body. “There is no such thing as any safe level of lead exposure,” said Deborah Cory-Slechta, a neurotoxicologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. McConnell and his colleagues have now detected lead in layers of ice collected in Russia and Greenland that date to the time of the Roman Empire. Lead entered the atmosphere from Roman mining operations, hitched a ride on air currents and eventually fell out of the atmosphere as snow in the Arctic, the team surmised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171d1bw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead exposure is responsible for a range of human health impacts, with even relatively low levels impacting the cognitive development of children. DRI scientists have previously used atmospheric pollution records preserved in Arctic ice cores to identify periods of lead pollution throughout the Roman Empire, and now new research expands on this finding to identify how this pollution may have affected the European population.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The study, published Jan. 6 in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, examined three ice core records to identify lead &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pollution/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; levels in the Arctic between 500 BCE through 600 CE. This era spans the rise of the Roman Republic through the fall of the Roman Empire, with the study focusing on the approximately 200-year height of the Empire called the Pax Romana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead isotopes allowed the research team to identify mining and smelting operations throughout Europe as the likely source of pollution during this period. Advanced computer modeling of atmospheric movement then produced maps of atmospheric lead pollution levels across Europe. Combined with research linking lead exposure to cognitive decline, the research team also identified likely reductions in IQ levels of at least 2 to 3 points among the European population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to take a pollution record from an ice core and invert it to get atmospheric concentrations of pollution and then assess human impacts," says Joe McConnell, research professor of hydrology at DRI and lead author of the study. "The idea that we can do this for 2,000 years ago is pretty novel and exciting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Records of the past preserved in ice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McConnell's Ice Core Laboratory at DRI has spent decades examining ice cores from places like Greenland and Antarctica, where sheets of ice have built up over millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using enormous drills, they painstakingly extract columns of ice as much as 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) long, reaching more distant depths of Earth's history with each inch. McConnell's team creates precise timelines using records of well-dated volcanic eruptions, which stamp the ice record like postcards from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas bubbles trapped in the ice offer insight into the atmosphere of past eras, while pollutants like lead can be used to interpret mining and industrial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McConnell began developing methods to create very detailed lead records in ice more than twenty years ago, when he applied them to more recent history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When archaeologists and historians learned of this work, they approached him hoping to apply these new techniques to the Roman period, seeking answers to lingering historical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The resulting research changed our understanding of the era by finding precise linkages between the lead pollution records and historical events such as population declines associated with periodic plagues and pandemics," adds co-author and ancient historian Andrew Wilson of Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A growing understanding of the harms of lead pollution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient lead pollution stemmed largely from silver mining, whereby the lead-rich mineral galena was melted down to extract silver. For every ounce of silver obtained, this process produced thousands of ounces of lead—much of which was released to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, lead pollution predominantly came from the emissions of vehicles burning leaded gasoline. Following the passing of the Clean Air Act in the U.S. in 1970, which restricted the use of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/leaded+gasoline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;leaded gasoline&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have tracked the sharp decline of lead in human blood. However, the nationwide exposure, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-03-exposure-century-shrunk-iq-scores.html" target="_blank"&gt;particularly for children born between 1950 and 1985&lt;/a&gt;, allowed scientists to track lead's impact on health and cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As lead pollution has declined during the last 30 years, it has become more and more apparent to epidemiologists and medical experts just how bad lead is for human development," McConnell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adults, high levels of lead exposure are linked to infertility, anemia, memory loss, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and reduced immune response, among other impacts. In children, even low levels of exposure have been connected to reduced IQ, concentration challenges, and reduced academic success.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a blood lead level of 3.5 µg/dl the point for medical intervention for children, they have stated that there is no level of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/lead+exposure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lead exposure&lt;/a&gt; without risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lead is known to have a wide range of human health impacts, but we chose to focus on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; because it's something we can put a number on," says study co-author Nathan Chellman, assistant research professor of snow and ice hydrology at DRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An IQ reduction of 2 to 3 points doesn't sound like much, but when you apply that to essentially the entire European population, it's kind of a big deal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that atmospheric lead pollution began during the Iron Age and reached a peak during the late 2nd century BCE at the height of the Roman Republic. It then declined sharply during the 1st century BCE, during the crisis of the Roman Republic, before increasing around 15 BCE following the rise of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead pollution remained high until the Antonine Plague from 165 to the 180s CE, which severely affected the Roman Empire. It wasn't until the High Middle Ages in the early 2nd millennium CE that lead pollution in the Arctic exceeded the sustained high levels of the Roman Empire. According to the research, more than 500 kilotons of lead were released into the atmosphere during the nearly 200-year height of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ice core records show that Arctic lead pollution was up to 40-fold higher during the highest historical peak in the early 1970s, the insight gained from this study demonstrates how "humans have been impacting their health for thousands of years through industrial activity," McConnell says.&lt;/p&gt;

Current treatments, such as dialectical behavior therapy, fail to fully address social integration, which is crucial for long-term recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better approach may involve general psychiatric management (GPM), which emphasizes self-reliance, community engagement, and expanding social networks through low-stakes relationships. Interventions like group therapy, vocational programs, and community activities could help patients build lasting connections and reduce dependency on exclusive therapeutic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness in BPD:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients report high loneliness levels despite symptom remission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; Current therapies overlook fostering real-world social integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; GPM promotes self-reliance through group therapy, vocational work, and shared activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Loneliness is a key driver in the maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD), Harvard researchers argue. Thus, many patients cite increased social connection as a primary treatment goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Review of Psychiatry,&lt;/em&gt; part of the Lippincott portfolio from Wolters Kluwer, Lois W. Choi-Kain, MD, MEd, DFAPA, of Harvard’s McLean Hospital, and colleagues call for BPD treatment to extend beyond exclusive therapeutic relationships to help patients build durable connections with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any support in building small connections can provide some relief from loneliness and work against cycles of dependency, exclusivity, and volatility in social relations,” the authors emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, benefits achieved through community resource-driven interventions are valuable in a landscape in which demand for traditional psychotherapeutic treatment drastically outweighs supply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness is core to BPD, but current interventions do not address it comprehensively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a review of scientific literature, Dr. Choi-Kain’s team found that, compared with healthy controls, individuals with BPD consistently report higher levels of loneliness, which is defined as a subjective feeling of insufficient social connection distinct from the person’s objective degree of social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, social networks of people with BPD include more intense and exclusive relationships, such as romantic partners and therapists, and fewer acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness often persists when clinical symptoms remit, indicating that it is integral to BPD. In the general population, loneliness has been linked to numerous chronic health conditions and premature mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, loneliness should be targeted as a general health intervention in BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, however, identified multiple studies demonstrating that dialectical behavior therapy, which concentrates on emotional dysregulation and skill deficits, does not result in adequate functional improvements in roles that can provide a positive sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major psychodynamic approaches, such as mentalization-based treatment and transference-focused psychotherapy, focus on enhancing accurate and mature social cognition and insight, but do not always focus on social integration in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General psychiatric management promotes self-reliance and community engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to noting the shortfalls of current treatment approaches, Dr. Choi-Kain and her co-authors critique colleagues for “advocating sequential migration of patients through multiple intensive specialist psychotherapies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They point out, “this practice of stringing together lengthy and inaccessible therapies continuously socializes patients into dyadic caregiving in treatment settings rather than emphasizing self-reliance in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better option, the group says, is the general psychiatric management (GPM) model, which considers hypersensitivity to interpersonal stressors to be the core dysfunction in BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to harnessing psychoeducation to help patients more realistically understand their social interactions, GPM emphasizes developing self-esteem and identity through work and other forms of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to expand patients’ social networks by helping them form low-stakes relationships through role-bound, scheduled, activity-directed interactions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Group therapy, which allows patients to practice social behavior in a supportive environment, provides a forum for explicit instruction on rules and community values, and balances the intense and exclusive relationships that people with BPD tend to form&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connection to nonclinical community resources, including organized activities in line with patients’ genuine interests, such as gardening, sports, and the arts, as well as engaging in individualized pursuits in a shared space&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vocational interventions to increase patients’ self-reliance by participating in daily activities and structured relationships with others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peer support, which appears to benefit both patients and peer support specialists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Choi-Kain’s group urges more attention to the long-term recovery period for patients with BPD, beyond initial symptom reduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Greater investment in this later treatment phase is critical and requires further research to help patients work independently, among peers, and in relationship with others to solidify and stabilize their personality functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this borderline personality disorder and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5933362a312c38773d3c2a2d3c3f383736192e36352d3c2b2a32352c2e3c2b773a3634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Josh DeStefano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolterskluwer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Josh DeStefano – Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HRP.0000000000000417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Borderline Personality Disorder and Loneliness: Broadening the Scope of Treatment for Social Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;” by Lois W.

This characteristic drives distinguishing criteria, such as frantic efforts to avoid abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both BPD and loneliness are linked with elevated mortality risk and multiple negative health outcomes. Psychodynamic theories of BPD emphasize fundamental impairment in attachment and interpersonal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empirical research demonstrates an association between BPD diagnosis and increased loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with BPD experience higher levels of loneliness than the general population, and their social networks are systematically smaller, less diverse, and less satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences in the subjective experience of loneliness persist when controlling for these relevant social network features, indicating that people with BPD experience more loneliness than others in the same objective social circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to patients with BPD, increased social connection is often a primary treatment goal and marker of satisfying recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, few evidence-based approaches that primarily target loneliness and building life structures that support durable connections with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, loneliness persists as an intractable problem, often failing to remit alongside other symptoms, and few resources are routinely implemented to address this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we argue that loneliness is central to the symptomatic oscillations and subjective experiences of many patients with BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that treatment extend beyond the overemphasized therapeutic alliance relationship to also promote socialization and group and vocational settings to enhance patients’ social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building larger social networks that rely less on exclusive caregiving and/or romantic relationships and more on role-bound identity building and community relationships would more directly target long-term identity diffusion and relational instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such interventions can harness nonclinical community resources, such as group treatment, vocational supports, and peer supports.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:46:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBobGYwQVZ4emNfVUpqSkJmaWNtbm5RWWVORXpaRjlNLXhNMnRfQlhER0h3dGRmcmZBdGdaaHR0RnFyeGNCbFdaQWdTR1p4em9xaGNkOEN2SmFMc0tUeVJTU1pSYnRiUlo1OW41by1XOXRHNTFraTg5dw</guid></item><item><title>Night owl or early bird?

   &lt;p&gt;Did the holidays mess up your sleep patterns? Maybe you stayed up late ringing in the new year, or changed time zones while traveling. Science journalist Lynne Peeples says the body's circadian rhythms are sensitive to many different types of changes — but especially to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her new book, &lt;em&gt;The Inner Clock: Living in Sync with Our Circadian Rhythms&lt;/em&gt;, Peeples describes an experiment in which she lived for 10 days in an underground bunker, with no exposure to sunlight or clocks.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wanted to get a sense of my personal rhythm," she explains. "We all tick a little differently, and so I wasn't totally clear on just how my inner clocks ticked."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Peeples says she quickly lost sense of time, and began suffering from clumsiness and brain fog: "I think day seven or eight, I was just dropping everything and super uncoordinated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Throughout the experiment, Peeples charted her temperature, heart rate and glucose levels. Later, she worked with scientists to analyze the data she had gathered over the 10-day period. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"About that same time that I was feeling just really out of whack, uncoordinated and a little loopy ... that was when the data showed that my heart-rate rhythm and my temperature rhythms were no longer coordinated, and also when I was becoming more and more uncoordinated with the sun," she says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Peeples says her time in the bunker illustrates the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5178149/light-exposure-circadian-rhythms-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;importance of daylight&lt;/a&gt;: "Our clocks and this coordination of our entire physiology really counts on those inputs of light and dark to tell the body that it's day and night and coordinate those activities. And when we don't get daylight, when we don't get those photons to help calibrate those clocks, then things go awry. And that affects our mental health and our physical health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt; Interview highlights&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-41204" class="bucketwrap image medium"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how important circadian rhythms are to our overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We have trillions of tiny "clocks" in our bodies. Really, when you think about it, nearly every cell in your body has a clock. And these clocks evolved to coordinate with each other and with the sun to help our bodies be primed to do the right things at the right time. … We evolved to be most alert and awake and take advantage of the light of the day. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And "circa" in circadian means about or around. So our inner clocks did evolve to be ... around 24 hours but they're not precise timekeepers so we need that regular calibration from the environment, from the Earth's 24-hour cycle to keep them coordinated with each other and with the sun so that they are primed to do those right things at the right times. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; On the importance of daylight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The science suggests that light across the whole day is crucial, but in particular, morning light. … It's pretty clear that during the daytime, especially in the early hours, getting daylight will help recalibrate our rhythms. And then throughout the day, the accumulation of that, getting those photons from the full spectrum that the sun offers, in particular those blue wavelengths of light that we get from the sun, will help align our rhythms as well as help make them more robust. ... &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then at night again, to keep that contrast, to make the body understand that this was day and this is night when we're supposed to wind down for sleep, that's when we need the lights down and not blasting our overhead lights in our our homes, for example, or putting our face in front of screens. So it's all about that contrast.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On daylight saving time disrupting our circadian rhythms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When we spring forward or fall back, we are giving ourselves a dose of jet lag, but we're locking the clock there. So when we spring forward, we're essentially stealing an hour of light from the morning, which is when we really want the light. And we're tagging that on to the end of the day, when we our bodies really are looking for the dark and it's throwing us out of alignment from the sun. Before we had any kind of standard time around the world locally, the sun was generally at its highest point of overhead at noon. And if we shift that with daylight saving time, we're throwing that off. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On everyone's clocks ticking differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We all tick a little differently. Those inner clocks in our bodies that tick at around 24 hours, for some of us, that means that they take a little longer than 24 hours, and for some, they're faster and it's a little under 24 hours to do its full circuit, so to speak. So because of that, there's times a day that we have a greater predilection for certain things. And if we think about sleep/wake, that's where I think most of us experience these differences. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are some of us that if we have a shorter circadian rhythm, we might more likely be early birds. It's easier for us to go to sleep early at night and we might wake early. And on the other end of the spectrum, there are the extreme night owls, where they may be at their peak late and be awake and alert into the night and then wanting to sleep in late in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So it's both the speed at which our clocks tick, as well as this alignment with light. Scientists are trying to understand that more now. But how our body responds to light is also affecting how these clocks align with the 24-hour day. There's not just early birds and night owls. There's a full spectrum that goes to pretty great extremes. Different genetics can program or predispose some people to truly function better overnight than during the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;On how our clock changes with age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-41202" class="bucketwrap image medium"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When we are first born, as parents can attest, we don't really have a lot of rhythm. We're kind of eating and sleeping throughout the day and night. And then as we get a little older, young kids tend to be early risers, and that quickly changes when we reach adolescence. So at that point, early teen years, our rhythms start to drift later., [by] as much as two or three hours. A kid that used to rise and be alert and ready to go at 6 a.m., now it might be more like 9 a.m. And of course, that means it's harder for these kids to go to sleep at night. And then as we get older, it kind of balances out a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And then in our older years, on average, we tend to be maybe slightly early risers. But ... scientists are finding, as we get older, our circadian rhythms get blunted, they get weaker. So we do not have as profound of a rise and fall in our rhythms and that manifests in a weaker sleep/wake cycle. So we might be more prone to napping during the day. You know, you think about like the the grandparent sitting in the chair and are falling asleep during the day and then maybe struggling to sleep at night. That is always partially due to the circadian rhythm being weakened as we get older. But ... we're also understanding how to potentially strengthen those rhythms, in part through things like getting that extra contrast of light and dark throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On research out of the University of Pittsburgh studying the correlation between some mental health disorders and circadian rhythms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It might be the case that certain drugs that are used for mental health disorders, like schizophrenia and depression, might actually work by affecting the circadian clock. … This vicious spiral that happens with a lot of mental health disorders where somebody has depression, for example, and they're indoors during the day. … Being indoors and missing that morning light then sets them up to more likely stay awake later at night. And then that's going to set them up to sleep in the next day. And overall, that's going to weaken their rhythms. And if there's a link between that and the disorder itself, it creates the snowball effect that some of the science is pointing to potentially a way out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On disruption to our circadian rhythms and Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The science is pretty clear that as we disrupt our rhythms and we disrupt our immune system and our ability to metabolize food at the right times a day and all these things. It's not a shock to scientists that there could be ramifications for how that could propel the development of cancer and heart disease, other cardiometabolic disorders, and then in the long term, potentially dementia&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; … &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If we understand that, maybe that could help us find new treatments or help certain people as we get older to access more of those cues, more of that circadian hygiene that helps their rhythms stay robust. And could that again put off and delay the onset of these diseases? Or if somebody has that disease, could having those stronger rhythms alleviate some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of that disease? These are open questions, but a lot of promising research [is] suggesting that there there is a lot of potential here.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The 13-year-old boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck. Doctors were puzzled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing ruled out their first suspicion. But further tests pinpointed what they — and the boy — had been missing: iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century ago, iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country. It essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt, bread and some other foods, in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But today, people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most people are still getting enough, researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people, raising concerns about an impact on their newborns. And there is also a very small, but growing, number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This needs to be on people’s radar,” said Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez, a Brown University doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in Providence, Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is iodine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas. A French chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor. The name iodine comes from a Greek word meaning violet-colored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that century, scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy, and that it’s crucial in the development of brain function in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck, known as a goiter. The thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions. When there’s not enough iodine, the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the United States, especially in a “goiter belt” that stretched from Appalachia and the Great Lakes to the northwest United States. Some of the kids were unusually short, deaf, intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as “cretinism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding iodine to salt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts realized they couldn’t solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood, but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt. Iodized salt first became available in 1924. By the 1950s, more than 70% of U.S. households used iodized table salt. Bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine, and iodine deficiency became rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But diets changed. Processed foods now make up a large part of the American diet, and though they contain a lot of salt, it’s not iodized. Leading bread brands no longer add iodine. In the case of the 13-year-old boy, he has mild autism and was a fussy eater, mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for people who do salt their food, the fashion now is to use kosher salt, Himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="SovrnAd Advertisement " data-module data-class="sovrn-story-feed" data-delayadinsertion&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People have forgotten why there’s iodine in salt,” said Dr. Elizabeth Pearce of Boston Medical Center. She is a leader in the Iodine Global Network, a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9768638/#:~:text=The%20National%20Health%20and%20Nutrition,trend%20that%20must%20be%20monitored." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported 50% drop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in U.S. iodine levels in surveyed Americans between the 1970s and the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much iodine is enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though iodine consumption is falling overall, most Americans are still getting enough through their diet, experts say. But doctors worry that’s not the case for women and children, who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day. You can get that from one-half to three-quarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years or so, U.S. researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women. A Michigan State University &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(20)30716-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of about 460 pregnant women in the city of Lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="SovrnAd Advertisement " data-module data-class="sovrn-story-feed" data-delayadinsertion&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many prenatal vitamins don’t contain iodine, noted Jean Kerver, the study’s lead author. That’s why &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/hcp/diet-micronutrients/iodine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doctors recommend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower IQs and language delay in children, although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start, Pearce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say there hasn’t been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the U.S. population in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serrano-Gonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We’re concerned this may be increasing, especially in patients with restricted diets,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;___&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The commander of our body, it was widely considered an overlord, one that told everything else what to do while also thinking noble thoughts or, more likely in my case, daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-hbKfVi bHGvbW desktop-only teads "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time and studies advanced, it became obvious that that wasn’t the case, that our brain wasn’t a series of slimy ropes sending electrical impulses around, coldly directing the organs and muscles and sinews, but rather in communication with them. Especially our gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, according to the Clinical Nutritionist Dr Stephanie J Moore, our gut is, if anything, the master of our brain: “four times more information passes up from the gut to the brain than from the brain to the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So convinced is Moore that the gut is the cradle of good brain health – and by extension good mood, good energy levels, good &lt;a href="/topic/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and so on — that she has devoted her latest book, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-in-hand.co.uk/product/eat-your-brain-happy/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat Your Brain Happy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to the pursuit of fostering a better brain via the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intrigued me. Not only because I’ve long suspected the brain fog that becomes my constant companion at the end of the year is the result of popping many mince pies, and wanted to know for sure — but also because the idea of catering my diet to make me more alert appeals. So I wanted to know exactly what I should be loading up on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore’s response to my mince pie dilemma was fortunately, not to tell me that I shouldn’t have had any at all (sacrilege), but rather to focus on getting enough &lt;a href="/topic/nutrients"&gt;nutrients.&lt;/a&gt; “Without these, the brain simply cannot function well, never mind thrive — and short-term that could mean brain fog, inability to concentrate, poor memory recall, general fatigue, but if it persists there’s a risk of neurodegeneration, where over decades, a poorly nourished brain can develop &lt;a href="/topic/dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So more kale it is. And, chewing, apparently. Moore recommends bearing these rules in mind if you want to give your brain a hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a woman with a robust appetite, this filled me with glee, Moore advising that “The brain is incredibly nutrient and energy hungry, so if you’re under-eating, or eating nutrient-poor foods, the gut and the brain are likely to suffer.” She suggests making sure at least one of your daily meals contains “mostly wholesome, unprocessed foods, a range of colourful plant foods, and natural protein sources such as fish, eggs, meat, soy, beans, and lentils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A dehydrated brain is an anxious brain,” Moore says. The answer to this isn’t just to lay off dehydrating factors like booze, but also to hydrate well in the morning after having been asleep for hours. “That’s really key, so before you have any coffee or tea, make a commitment to yourself to have a large, room temperature glass of water with a little lemon or line juice and a tiny pinch or salt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore says this is “imperative”, that “our brain is cleaned of toxins and plaques that build up each day during good quality &lt;a href="/topic/sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;.” You may not like reading this, but she repeats the oft-issued maxim that you do really need to move away from digital devices to prep for that all-important sleep; “our digital devices can be over-stimulating to the nervous system, and they’re one of the most common causes for a poor night’s sleep and sluggish brain the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me, you’ll have some go-to vegetables, and you’ll buy them every time you do a shop. Moore says this is a mistake, that keeping your gut microbes happy and well-balanced requires “as diverse a range of plant-based foods as possible, so rather than eating the same one or two over and over, include a variety.” She encourages richly-coloured fruits (including berries, kiwi, and green apples), as well as bitter leaves like rocket, watercress, or chicory because they contain “potent prebiotic fibre that feeds your keystone gut microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/lifestyle/wellness/wellness-clinics-retreats-expert-tips-what-to-eat-sleep-b1186892.html" title="Secrets from the world’s best wellness clinics… that you can do at home"&gt;Every single good medical clinic I’ve ever been to&lt;/a&gt; bangs on about chewing, but that doesn’t mean it happens in practise. I’m going to redouble my efforts. “However great your diet, if you’re not chewing thoroughly and taking time to focus on your food, you’ll impair your ability to digest and absorb the essential nutrients from your food, and you are far more likely to have large, undigested food particles being passed into the intestine, which can upset digestion and cause bloating and discomfort due to dysbiosis, where ‘unfriendly’ gut bugs outcompete the good ones – and this is especially true of poorly-digested proteins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-ilJxFg hXwUTU full-bleed-1000"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kOPcWz gqjFGk"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/11/20/14/01/The-foods-to-help-your-brain-out.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;width=320 320w,

Beyond being easy to chuck in your handbag, they’re particularly good for the brain, she says: “they’re highly-absorbable protein, which is required for mending our tissues, making enzymes for good digestion, and core ingredients for brain chemistry — and yolks are an exceptional source of choline, which is needed for the brain to make acetylcholine, a key neuro-chemical for anxiety and general brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think mackerel, sardines, and herring. “These small fish don’t have the heavy toxic load of large fish like tuna, and contain good amounts of the essential and brain healthy fat: omega 3.” They’re also an excellent source of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This family of foods — which include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbages, and, the brassica superstar, broccoli sprouts — “are nutrient-rich, full of great prebiotic fibre to feed your gut microbes, and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties help protect the brain from oxidative damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scatter liberally! “Pumpkin seeds are fab for their zinc and magnesium content, which are both important for the gut and brain.” They also contain healthy fats, which Moore says the brain is largely made up of and therefore appreciates being a part of your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-gEvEer kGHzwr"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aXZVg iLuLZl"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;… or cacao nibs/very dark &lt;a href="/topic/chocolate"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt; that’s more that 75 per cent cocoa, for that matter. Very good for the brain, says Moore, because, “with high levels of magnesium to calm the nervous system, polyphenols that feed the gut microbes, plus tryptophan, a precursor to the ‘happy’ brain chemicals serotonin and anandamide (which is known to increase oxytocin, which is our love and connection brain chemical).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Evening Standard</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:20:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNMERlOVZwX0xvNS14ZUhlT3dMcEdsTHZsSjR2ZUgwYUxBbVpFVzZNTjZXNV8yLUVxaWpHT1ZUTFlxRUdiUU1aNHZXc2xYMGUteVhGeXpmU3lPTFVkcjdJYTVBcFU1dW1NSDNmc3k4OV8xVV9lSXFSSUxTd3BJcmhiX2JRNWdSRFFpM2hVRVNEMnc2Q1BEbk5DQU1tUEhXMmM</guid></item><item><title>Doctors worry that iodine deficiency — a dietary problem from the past — is coming back - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQOGM4bzFuRU43QVVNaWJIZHI3eURDVXpYLVY0TDZMMGZnekhoVHI2eEpac3c5WFJSSW9MWERyTW11MGtlSjNuSnl0eVQxOXh5cE56dHRpSHZjTkVGZ05ONWxVcHlFdDJQYmM0ZjN2Z0JrSjQ5YzlyNFc5SDNmT0wwMWx2cWNIMTdDRFZCYmQtMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-article-mobile md:max-w-[750px] md:grid-cols-article" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The 13-year-old boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck. Doctors were puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Testing ruled out their first suspicion. But further tests pinpointed what they — and the boy — had been missing: iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;A century ago, iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country. It essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt, bread and some other foods, in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="col-body md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h4 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;But today, people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Although most people are still getting enough, researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people, raising concerns about an impact on their newborns. And there is also a very small, but growing, number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“This needs to be on people’s radar,” said Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez, a Brown University doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in Providence, Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;What is iodine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Iodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas. A French chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor. The name iodine comes from a Greek word meaning violet-colored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Later that century, scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy, and that it’s crucial in the development of brain function in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;One sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck, known as a goiter. The thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions. When there's not enough iodine, the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the United States, especially in a “goiter belt” that stretched from Appalachia and the Great Lakes to the northwest United States. Some of the kids were unusually short, deaf, intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as “cretinism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Adding iodine to salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Public health experts realized they couldn't solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood, but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt. Iodized salt first became available in 1924. By the 1950s, more than 70% of U.S. households used iodized table salt. Bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine, and iodine deficiency became rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;But diets changed. Processed foods now make up a large part of the American diet, and though they contain a lot of salt, it's not iodized. Leading bread brands no longer add iodine. In the case of the 13-year-old boy, he has mild autism and was a fussy eater, mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;And for people who do salt their food, the fashion now is to use kosher salt, Himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“People have forgotten why there's iodine in salt,” said Dr. Elizabeth Pearce of Boston Medical Center. She is a leader in the Iodine Global Network, a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;She noted a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9768638/#:~:text=The%20National%20Health%20and%20Nutrition,trend%20that%20must%20be%20monitored." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported 50% drop;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported 50% drop&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. iodine levels in surveyed Americans between the 1970s and the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;How much iodine is enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Though iodine consumption is falling overall, most Americans are still getting enough through their diet, experts say. But doctors worry that's not the case for women and children, who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day. You can get that from one-half to three-quarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;In the last 15 years or so, U.S. researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women. A Michigan State University &lt;a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(20)30716-X/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of about 460 pregnant women in the city of Lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Many prenatal vitamins don't contain iodine, noted Jean Kerver, the study's lead author. That's why &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/hcp/diet-micronutrients/iodine.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:doctors recommend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;doctors recommend&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower IQs and language delay in children, although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start, Pearce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Experts say there hasn't been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the U.S. population in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Serrano-Gonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“We’re concerned this may be increasing, especially in patients with restricted diets," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient had originally needed a liver transplant because he developed alcoholic cirrhosis - liver disease that causes scarring of the organ due to excessive drinking - and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But body scans did not show signs of cancer anywhere else in the body, doctors &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/24/6/e391/6439429"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in the patient's case report published in The Oncologist and shared in the NIH's National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While his medical team originally tried minimally invasive procedures to cure the cancer, the man developed worsening liver function and a transplant was deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months after his initial diagnosis, he underwent a liver transplant at The Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four months later, a routine ultrasound revealed two solid masses in his liver. While the masses had not been seen on previous scans, doctors still ruled them 'indeterminate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient then underwent a CT scan, which revealed three new masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six weeks later, an MRI showed 'innumerable liver masses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biopsies confirmed 'poorly differentiated carcinoma,' suggesting an aggressive and advanced form of metastatic lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors wrote: 'The... features of the tumor were distinctly different from those of the prior HCC. These findings were suspicious for donor‐transmitted malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A polymerase chain reaction‐based assay [PCR test] strongly suggested that the newly diagnosed metastatic carcinoma in the liver originated from the donor.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above charts show the genetic makeup of the tumor in the man's transplanted liver is the same as that of the donor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests the organ donor had undiagnosed, advanced lung cancer that had spread to his liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 50-year-old male deceased donor had a history of smoking, but did not have a history of lung tumors or cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further, pre-donation testing did not uncover any tumors and exams of the donor's lungs did not uncover any causes for concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the spread of his cancer, the patient was not eligible to receive another liver transplant and anti-rejection medications - prescribed so his body did not reject his new liver - had to be reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man received chemotherapy drugs and the cancer appeared to be stabilizing, but a subsequent scan revealed it had progressed beyond treatment. He died approximately six months after his transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors wrote: 'Progression of [liver] metastases and reduced immunosuppressive agents led to liver failure and the patient's death.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case report stated donor-derived lung cancer in a liver has only ever been reported one other time in a 41-year-old man whose donor was discovered to have lung cancer several days after the transplant.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is the first-known case of donor-derived cancer from a donor with no known cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above images show a CT scan of the liver tumor (top, circled) and an MRI of the liver tumor (bottom, circled)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Transplanted' cancer cases are extremely rare.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2013 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3685882/pdf/cshperspectmed-TRN-a015677.pdf"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;of these cases published in the Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine states there is no estimation of risk for transmitting cancer from donor to recipient and there is limited data on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Report authors wrote: 'The incidence of any cancer transmission is so low that sporadic case reports are the main source of information.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An earlier &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8475546/"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;from 1993 that looked at data from the 1970s also found there were only 'sporadic' reports of cancer being transmitted through organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2013 review added: 'The low frequency and very variable stage of cancers mean that definitive risk calculations are impossible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors continued, the data is 'highly likely to underestimate the true incidence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using the limited data available, authors of the 2013 report found cancers known to have been transmitted from donor to recipient on at least one occasion include, breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and renal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These findings may shed light on sensory processing challenges in autism and other neurological conditions, paving the way for deeper understanding and potential interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Smell signals from the basal amygdala merge with hearing in the auditory cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Cue Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Disrupted smell signals impair maternal behaviors like pup retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may explain sensory processing challenges in autism and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CSHL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re at a dinner party, but you can’t smell the food cooking or hear the dinner bell. Sounds like a dream, right? What if it wasn’t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we experience the world and interact with people, we use all our senses,” Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Professor Stephen Shea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s true for animals and humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107335"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-sensory-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These conditions can affect how the brain processes incoming information, making it difficult to interpret the social cues that drive conversations, dates, and other interpersonal activities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that’s not always the case in developmental disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions can affect how the brain processes incoming information, making it difficult to interpret the social cues that drive conversations, dates, and other interpersonal activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how such signals mix and influence each other in the brain isn’t well understood. To shed light on the subject, Shea and graduate student Alexander Nowlan traced how smell and hearing interact in mouse brains during a maternal behavior called pup retrieval. This activity isn’t limited to mothers. It can also be learned by surrogates. Think stepmoms and babysitters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pup retrieval is one of the most important things for mothers or caregivers. It requires the ability to smell and hear the pup. If these things are both important, that may mean they merge somewhere in the brain. One interesting thing we found was a projection from a location called the basal amygdala (BA),” explains Shea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the BA is involved in learning and processing social and emotional signals. During pup retrieval, the team found that BA neurons carry smell signals to the brain’s hearing center, the auditory cortex (AC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, they merge with incoming sound signals and influence the animal’s response to future sounds—like pups’ cries. Amazingly, when Shea’s team blocked maternal mice from accessing smell signals, their pup retrieval response almost completely broke down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think what’s reaching the AC is being filtered through social-emotional signals from BA neurons,” Shea explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That processing can be impaired in autism and neurodegenerative conditions. We think many parts of the brain participate in this behavior and that it’s very richly controlled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shea’s lab is now exploring how these brain regions connect and interact with one another. Their work may lead to a better understanding of how autism can affect a person’s ability to interpret social cues. But that’s just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that we found a neural circuit that may allow emotional processes to directly interact with perception is very exciting to me,” Shea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not alone there. His research might yet provide answers to one of humanity’s oldest questions. How do our senses inform the ways we connect with one another and experience the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social and sensory neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31565850435f58544358715242595d1f545544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Giarnieri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cshl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CSHL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Giarnieri – CSHL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.10.078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multisensory integration of social signals by a pathway from the basal amygdala to the auditory cortex in maternal mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephen Shea et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multisensory integration of social signals by a pathway from the basal amygdala to the auditory cortex in maternal mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social encounters are inherently multisensory events, yet how and where social cues of distinct sensory modalities merge and interact in the brain is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When their pups wander away from the nest, mother mice use a combination of vocal and olfactory signals emitted by the pups to locate and retrieve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work revealed the emergence of multisensory interactions in the auditory cortex (AC) of both dams and virgins who cohabitate with pups (“surrogates”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify a neural pathway that relays information about odors to the AC to be integrated with responses to sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that a scattered population of glutamatergic neurons in the basal amygdala (BA) projects to the AC and responds to odors, including the smell of pups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurons exhibit increased activity when the female is searching for pups that terminates upon contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we show that selective optogenetic activation of BA-AC neurons modulates responses to pup calls, and that this modulation switches from predominantly suppressive to predominantly excitatory after maternal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports an underappreciated role for the amygdala in directly shaping sensory representations in an experience-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the BA-AC pathway supports integration of olfaction and audition to facilitate maternal care and speculate that it may carry valence information to the AC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:03:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE50MVpIYmI5T3FjZEs5NVhKNWx4ZDdGNWtGMlUwR1hxTXJFcGRsN000Sm5XbzJ6aVJvSXdKU0hZY1dmcEdTMU9EVXhVQUxGMXFOck5xdFViU3pmVzBTY0NwZDQwZ0pXMXhPSWtESVhranpkWHloZHRr</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu kills 200 snow geese in Pennsylvania - TribLIVE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOTUtIdHphNnR6a0xTVWtxMklZT2F0RHpxMDRqTkZYc2ZjS3o5Mmx5ajkyMUF1VU0wU3BLNnFNLWdhd0ZUdGJhWU1uQWw1eFRBd2t6eXgydjlHLVpHVFl6TzlOTGlDcTUwelM0b08ydHF3VEVkUGJkcTZRSEM4eTFiNEpFNU9MbDZ4eGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 200 snow geese were found dead last week in the Allentown area — likely because of the bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead birds were found in both Nazareth Township in Northampton County and Upper Macungie Township in Lehigh County, &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/newsroom/influenza-suspected-in-snow-goose-mortalities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Pennsylvania Game Commission reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary in-state testing revealed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu, the commission said. The test results are being confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of infection in wild birds could include neurologic dysfunction such as swimming/walking in circles, holding their heads/necks in unnatural positions, being unable to tilt their heads, and having difficulty flying, &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/avian-influenza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/avian-influenza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Bird flu outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon to detect bird flu in wild birds, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, as it can circulate freely without birds appearing sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an HPAI outbreak began in January 2022 in the United States, and since then, it’s impacted wild and domestic birds in every state, the commission reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HPAI does not appear to (have) significantly impacted wild bird populations,” the commission said. “However, it does have the potential to significantly affect the commercial poultry industry and international trade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds affected include wild waterfowl and shorebirds like hawks, eagles, crows, gulls, ravens, ducks, geese, turkey and grouse. The flu is particularly contagious and lethal to domestic poultry, according to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because avian influenza viruses are naturally occurring and ever-present in wild birds, preventing or controlling HPAI in wild populations is not feasible,” the commission said. “However, safeguards can be taken to protect domestic birds or wild birds held in captivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners of domestic birds should make sure they don’t come in contact with wild birds to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Mitigating sickness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird flu outbreak remains ongoing, as sick birds were also observed at the locations where the 200 dead geese were found, the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been in contact with sick birds and is feeling under the weather should contact their health provider, &lt;a href="https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/avian-flu-suspected-after-200-snow-geese-found-dead-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to WHTM, a TV station in Harrisburg&lt;/a&gt;. The commission said people can also contact the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 877-724-3258.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans can become infected with the bird flu, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the current outbreak poses a low risk to the public. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;66 confirmed total reported human cases of the bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, with the majority in California, since the national flu surveillance began in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, the virus was detected in 10,922 wild birds nationwide, the CDC reported. AS of Thursday, 129,795,101 poultry and 915 dairy herds were affected nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should not handle wildlife unless they are hunting, trapping or authorized to do so, according to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Avoid contacting surfaces that may be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds,” the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hunters coming in contact with birds, they should wear nitrile gloves, protective eye wear and a mask, as well as wash their clothes and hands following a hunt, the game commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people encounter sick or dead wild birds, they should not handle them — and instead report them to the the Pennsylvania Game Commission by calling 1-833-742-9453, by emailing pgc-wildlifehealth@pa.gov or by using the online Wildlife Health Survey tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sick or dead domestic birds should be reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at 717-772-2852, according to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TikToker Amanda (@mandadawn93) has gone viral after sharing a surprising remedy for norovirus. As she sat in the car, Coke in hand, she said to viewers, “I don’t know if you guys have seen this Tiktok trend going on that if you have norovirus and you do not feel good, or you feel like you’ve been around people who have had it, get a McDonald’s Coke.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will take any excuse to get a McDonald’s Coke because that is the one thing that always makes me feel better when I don’t feel good,” she added. “Like, McDonald’s Coke always sounds good. So, I was around people this weekend. After we left the trip, everybody started throwing up, getting sick. So, cheers to a Coke. Go get one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the comments, users highlighted how Coke syrup in particular had helped them in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Am I the only one whose mom bought Coke syrup from the pharmacy when I was sick?” one asked. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“My mom used to give us straight Coke syrup (without the fizz) when we had a stomach bug and it worked,” another added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a third shared, “We used to get Coca-Cola syrup when we were sick as kids in the 70s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Coke syrup is a lot less widespread these days, the product remains available online if McDonald’s Cokes aren’t your thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video was viewed 293,200 times. Amanda didn’t immediately respond to the Daily Dot’s request for comment via TikTok comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-coke-help-heal-norovirus"&gt;Does Coke help heal norovirus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.12141"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; cited by &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/26124-coca-cola-stomach-blockages.html"&gt;LiveScience&lt;/a&gt; looked at 24 research papers focused on using Coke to treat stomach upset and blockages. As this study points out, Coke contains carbonic and phosphoric acid, making it highly acidic with a pH of 2.6. In turn, the researchers claimed that the drink mimics stomach acids that help to digest fiber. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide bubbles and sodium bicarbonate found in Coke are meant to assist the dissolving and digestive process further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wrote that “Coca-Cola ingestion should be the treatment of choice considering that less endoscopies and accessories are needed and patients stay less at the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, availability, low cost, rapid way of action, simplicity in administration and safety renders Coca-Cola a cost-effective therapy for gastric phytobezoars,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-mcdonald-s-coke-different"&gt;How is McDonald’s Coke different?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/why-mcdonalds-coke-tastes-better-than-all-others/"&gt;AllRecipes&lt;/a&gt;, McDonald’s Coke is a cut above the rest because, while the majority of restaurants have Coca-Cola syrup delivered in plastic bags, McDonald’s has theirs delivered in a special stainless steel container. As the outlet points out, “The special tanks keep the syrup fresh and protect it from light, temperature, air, and anything else that might take away from its delicious flavor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AllRecipes also points out that McDonald’s Coke has a superior filtration system. &lt;span&gt;This is because McDonald’s has water &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;it is added to the soda fountain, giving it added freshness.&lt;/span&gt; McDonald’s also pre-chills both the syrup and the water before it reaches the machine. Moreover, the outlet explains that there’s a higher syrup-to-water ratio in McDonald’s Cokes because it accounts for melting ice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately, you’re getting a more chilled, less polluted, and higher volume of that all-healing Coca-Cola syrup at McDonald’s than you would anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

His past work has &lt;a href="https://news.yorku.ca/2021/07/07/dancing-with-music-can-halt-most-debilitating-symptoms-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;examined the effects&lt;/a&gt; of dance on motor skills and quality-of-life issues such as sleep, sex, anxiety and mood, with only a minimal emphasis on depression, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZCZUWY2LSNGD5EIMPGGQXSSP2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This study, however, focused solely on dancing’s impact on depression using standard depression scale measures from questionnaires, and neuroimaging, to see how dancing affects the brain. The researchers found that dancing both improved mood and prompted changes in the activity of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21145043/"&gt;subcallosal cingulate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; (SCG), a brain region in the frontal cortex linked to mood regulation and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3JFVPDAEUNE2JL7H7DSMFJWTJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Not only did the introduction of dance make them feel better, but it impacted the brain similarly to what antidepressants do,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/helen-s-mayberg"&gt;Helen Mayberg&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral neurologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who has been studying both primary depression and depression in neurological diseases for more than 30 years. “That area of the brain is overactive when you are depressed and decreases its activity with drug treatment — dance appears to do something similar.” Mayberg was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PI2GAQDNRNERJDXXO7ACGA5UJE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PI2GAQDNRNERJDXXO7ACGA5UJE"&gt;Drop in depression rates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z6LSZDDTHNBHXNIZAJA6D7SULQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Parkinson’s results from the death of key neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain that produces the chemical messenger dopamine. Over time, the loss of these nerve cells impairs movement, speech and cognition — outward signs of Parkinson’s include tremors, muscle rigidity, slowed motion, and poor posture and balance — and can cause depression in an estimated 40 percent of those afflicted, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1372794/#:"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XTSHORMC5NER7I2UISRLJB376E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most people think Parkinson’s is just the tremors and the movement problems, but there are other less familiar aspects such as depression and anxiety,” DeSouza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YEELICDTJNGV3FXBE3FJGHKTC4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recent study was small — a limitation DeSouza acknowledged — and followed 23 Parkinson’s patients in the &lt;a href="https://www.nbs-enb.ca/dance-for-life/sharing-dance-parkinson-s/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharing Dance Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; program at Canada’s National Ballet School, along with 11 healthy controls, mostly family members or caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZOKKV2Q6U5CCPDZWRTRF5TVTLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The patients were “young” in their disease, meaning they had been diagnosed only within the past five years, DeSouza said, and “none had ever danced before.” The group included men and women in their 50s to their early 80s, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F4H4BRDLK5FVZLYY74PTFU2B7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Participants attended weekly 75-minute dance classes for eight months.

William Langston&lt;/a&gt;, clinical professor of neurology and neuroscience and of pathology at the Stanford School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said that “one of the hardest things in treating Parkinson’s is to get non-exercisers previously to start exercising, so anything they might like — whether boxing or dancing — that involves balance and gait would be terrific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZK2JXZKMHBH4LAYDUP4TIFQLHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mayberg described movement and mood as interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7CYYBM57GZCNZEXVLPEL3VMWXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When you are down in mood, you tend not to move, or you move less,” she said. “Even healthy people use movement to elevate mood — it’s why people run.

He hopes to expand his research, including learning more about what dancing does to trigger such a positive response.

While some viruses like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a20723391/what-is-genital-herpes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;herpes&lt;/a&gt; and West Nile may cause changes in the brain, CMV is not currently known to do this, Segil says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It's “extremely unlikely” that CMV causes Alzheimer’s disease, Segil says, adding that he has “no concerns” about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I protect myself from CMV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;You may have already had CMV and didn’t know it.

            Sugary drinks may leave a sour taste given their possible impact on mortality, according to a new study. “This is a public health crisis, requiring urgent action,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001m3b6ml57glorc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday in the journal&lt;/a&gt; Nature Medicine, analyzed global data on sugar-sweetened beverages consumed around the world, observational and randomized studies, and both diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevalence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001n3b6mvcy1rkby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the evidence, researchers created a comparative risk model and estimated that sugary drinks “cause more than 330,000 annual deaths from diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” Mozaffarian said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001o3b6mwyzkl6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem is particularly serious in Latin America and the Caribbean, which had the largest number of cardiovascular disease cases related to beverages,  and sub-Saharan Africa, which also had the most cases of type 2 diabetes from sugary drinks, he added, based on the researchers’ model.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001p3b6mdbgddhpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also examined the demographics of those most affected by sweetened drinks –– namely, younger male adults with higher education in urban areas, said Toby Smithson, a registered dietitian nutritionist, fellow of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and senior manager of nutrition and wellness at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001q3b6m571f3q43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s time to pay attention to, and take priority actions to deal with, this tragic preventable suffering,” Mozaffarian said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001s3b6mb3s23y6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the study did not test a behavior or intervention against a control group, the new study’s researchers can’t say that the sugar sweetened beverages are causing diabetes and cardiovascular disease –– they can only estimate the impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001t3b6m2vhx4dkx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers collected valuable data across 184 countries, but the study did not factor in all income levels and the increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among high-risk ethnic groups, Smithson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001v3b6m5r2g4maf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the finding of sugary beverages as harmful makes sense, as many studies have shown a link between such drinks and poor health impacts, Mozaffarian said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001w3b6ml5sh1xna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sugar sweetened beverages have “empty calories” — or calories without any nutritional benefits, Smithson said.  They are also a source of fast-acting carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream and raise blood sugar quickly, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001x3b6mon4uooeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These empty sugars in liquid form are even more harmful than those in desserts or sweet foods, Suzanne Janzi, a doctoral student in nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, said &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/health/sugary-drinks-heart-disease-wellness/index.html"&gt;in an earlier CNN article&lt;/a&gt;. She was not part of the most recent research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001y3b6ms776a8tz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Liquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods,” Janzi said in an email. “Solid sugars are often part of foods that contain other nutrients like fiber, proteins, and fats.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw001z3b6mb37x0f4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those nutrients slow digestion, meaning there is a more gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00203b6me5oz4282@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While fats, fiber and proteins in solid food leave you feeling fuller longer, liquid sugars often don’t fill you up, which can lead to appetite dysregulation and the consumption of too many calories, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00213b6mh8s4328c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Different sources of added sugars also vary in their consumption patterns, which could further explain why they associate differently with cardiovascular disease risk,” Janzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00233b6mgsitxbhm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about drinks that are sweetened with something other than sugar? They might be better, but they aren’t the answer, Mozaffarian said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00243b6mys2rljcc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Growing research shows that both natural and artificial low-calorie sweeteners are not innocuous and may cause health harms, so these should be considered a short-term, less harmful alternative, not a long-term solution,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00253b6mvsnd32qq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, artificial sweeteners might be a good substitute in moderation for people with diabetes, who may be accustomed to sugary drinks, Smithson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00273b6mq3abkvzw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By providing a diabetes-friendly way to prepare foods people are used to eating, we can meet people where they are in offering support to effectively manage their diabetes,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00283b6mp206nxf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But instead of relying on artificial sweeteners, Mozaffarian advises switching to unsweetened drinks all together, such as seltzer, unsweetened tea or coffee, or just plain water.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw00293b6m8ssgxk6t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hydration is important for managing blood pressure, blood sugar, internal temperature and digestion, Smithson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm5l86obw002a3b6m2tslpfn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/05/health/drinking-water-wellness/index.html"&gt;best hydrating beverage is water,”&lt;/a&gt; she said in an email. “If a person doesn’t like plain water, they can jazz up their beverage by drinking &lt;a href="https://diabetesfoodhub.org/recipes/sparkling-strawberry-mint-water" target="_blank"&gt;infused water&lt;/a&gt; with slices of lemon, lime, or fresh herbs, or using sparkling waters that contain no added sugar.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The food also tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) and the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ODVL) at Oregon State University conducted the tests after a house cat in Washington County contracted the illness and died. "Tests confirmed a genetic match between the virus in the raw and frozen pet food and the infected cat," a press release from ODA states. The company voluntarily recalled their products after the bird flu was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/recall/cat-food-bird-flu-recall-rcna185534" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Today Show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt; reports that dozens of cats have died since the bird flu outbreak started in March 2024. Cats seem to be more susceptible to die of bird flu than other animals. They seem to contract the illness from a variety of sources; either from unpasteurized dairy products, raw meat, exposure to infected birds, or exposure to people who work with infected birds.

    &lt;p&gt;On TikTok, influencers tout protein powder as key to building muscle and nourishing their bodies — all in a quick, convenient scoop added to coffee or a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that protein is essential for making muscles, strengthening bones and maintaining your immune system, digestion and hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most protein powders are considered dietary supplements, which raises the question: Do you really need a supplement to get enough protein? And if you do, what kind is best? We asked experts for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Are protein powders necessary? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “vast majority” of people in the United States already get enough protein from the foods they eat and don’t need to take it in supplement form, said Colleen Tewksbury, an assistant professor of nutrition science at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal guidelines recommend that adults 19 and older consume 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. That comes out to 54 grams for a 150-pound adult, or 72 grams for a person weighing 200 pounds. Research suggests, however, that older adults may benefit from adding about 50% more protein, and those who are pregnant, breastfeeding or do regular strength or endurance training may want to double the recommended amount or more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods — like chicken, fish, other lean meats, yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, nuts, beans and lentils — are the best sources of protein, experts said. They offer a variety of other valuable nutrients, like vitamins, minerals, fiber, healthy fats and plant-based compounds, said Wayne Campbell, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re “just slugging down a supplement” instead of eating real food, “you’ve got your protein, but you’re missing out on a lot of nutrition,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most protein powders contain about 20 grams of protein per serving. That’s roughly equivalent to the amount found in a half-cup of diced chicken breast; two cups of brown rice and beans; three-quarters of a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt topped with 1 ounce of walnuts; and three tablespoons of peanut butter on two medium slices of whole wheat bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once you’ve met your body’s protein needs, more is not necessarily better, Tewksbury said, since you can’t store extra protein. Instead, your liver will break it down to be used as calories or stored as fat. Because the kidneys have to eliminate the waste from that process, people with kidney disease should not consume too much protein, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Who might benefit from protein powder? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein powder can be useful for certain people, Tewksbury said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include those who need to get enough protein with smaller amounts of food — such as cancer patients with limited appetites, or those recovering from major gastrointestinal surgeries who can only consume liquids or small portions of food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, older adults who need fewer calories and often have reduced appetites may find that stirring protein powder into oatmeal or yogurt can help them get enough, said Nancy Rodriguez, a professor emerita of nutritional sciences at the University of Connecticut. About half of women and a third of men 71 and older in the United States aren’t meeting federal recommendations for protein. That may increase their risk of muscle loss, which can lead to falls, bone fractures and hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to build muscle size and strength, research suggests that using a protein powder can help you meet your goals, Rodriguez said. Consuming protein from regular foods can work just as well, she said, but busy athletes often choose to use protein powders for their convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind, Rodriguez said, that “eating protein does not mean you’re going to convert the protein to muscle.” You need a well-designed strength training program and extra calories to put on muscle, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And your body can’t use more than 20 to 40 grams of protein per meal to make muscle, Tewksbury said. That’s no more than a serving or two of protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Are there downsides to protein powders? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most protein powders are classified as dietary supplements, they aren’t tightly regulated by the federal government, Rodriguez said. They may not contain the amount of protein they claim, and researchers have detected small amounts of heavy metals and in rare cases, anabolic steroids in some protein supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most protein powders are likely safe, said Stefan Pasiakos, the director of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. But it’s best to choose one marked with a seal &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/articles/supplement-vitamin-certification" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;from a third party lab, like NSF&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.usp.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;U.S. Pharmacopeia&lt;/a&gt;, which independently test supplements to ensure they contain what’s on the label and nothing more, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein powders are also ultraprocessed foods, and health concerns are associated with certain ingredients used in them. They can contain added sugars like high fructose corn syrup; or they may be sweetened with artificial sweeteners or other sugar substitutes, like stevia or erythritol, which limited studies have linked to cardiovascular problems, Type 2 diabetes and microbiome changes. They may also contain emulsifiers, such as lecithin or xanthan gum, which some research suggests can increase gut inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a medical reason for using a protein supplement, the benefits likely outweigh the potential risks, Tewksbury said. For everyone else, she added, we don’t know enough about their long-term health effects to say if they might increase the risk of chronic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What should you look for in a protein powder? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many types of protein powders available, whey protein is backed by the most research, Pasiakos said. Made from milk, whey is rapidly digested and is a “complete” protein — meaning it contains enough of the nine essential amino acids, or building blocks to create new proteins in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most plants are low in at least one essential amino acid, so many powders contain blends of several plant sources to provide a balance of amino acids, Pasiakos said. “In the grand scheme of things,” he said, the type of protein you choose likely won’t matter much in terms of your ability to build muscle or meet your protein needs, he said. Pea, soy and rice protein powders, for example, have been shown to support muscle building, similar to whey protein in small trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important, Rodriguez said, is to choose one that doesn’t have a lot of extra ingredients, like added sugars, additives or vitamins and minerals in excess of the recommended daily value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simpler, the better,” Pasiakos agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County is investigating after &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/2024-12-25-mary-pilgrim-inn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;over a dozen people got sick&lt;/a&gt; following a Christmas dinner served at an emergency housing shelter in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 14 people who attended dinners at &lt;a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/survival-services/mary-pilgrim-inn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mary Pilgrim Inn&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for salmonella, the health department said Friday. Additional people who got sick are being tested, although the department hasn’t gotten results back yet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the people got sick after eating food served at two dinners on Christmas Day or leftovers on Dec. 26, 2024. The food served at the meals was only available to shelter residents and staff and was not open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salmonella is a bacterial infection spread through contaminated food and water or animal contact. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fever, chills, and abdominal cramping, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health staff visited Mary Pilgrim Inn on Dec. 31 to learn about the food preparation for the dinner and give suggestions to improve food safety.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent salmonella, health officials recommend washing hands after using the restroom and before eating or preparing food, cooking all meats thoroughly and washing cutting boards and counters immediately after being used for meat or poultry to avoid cross-contamination.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Pilgrim Inn on Aurora Avenue North in north Seattle is a temporary emergency shelter operated by the Downtown Emergency Service Center that houses single, highly vulnerable adults experiencing long-term homelessness. It does not offer walk-up services and offers people a play to stay while waiting for permanent housing placement.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a final analysis from the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02047097"&gt;Phase 4 ESTEEM clinical trial (NCT02047097)&lt;/a&gt;, which tracked outcomes from Tecfidera treatment among more than 5,100 MS patients. The results also did not reveal any unexpected safety issues with the long-approved therapy, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ESTEEM study, in which over 5,000 patients received [Tecfidera] in a real-world setting for up to 6.5 years, indicated sustained effectiveness of [Tecfidera] and safety consistent with the well-known profile of [Tecfidera],” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, titled “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40120-024-00680-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Dimethyl Fumarate in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis Treated in Routine Medical Practice: Final Analysis of the ESTEEM Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt; Neurology and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;. The work was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Biogen&lt;/a&gt;, which markets name-brand Tecfidera. Several generic versions of the therapy also are available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Researchers call ESTEEM ‘largest and longest real-world setting study’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tecfidera has been approved in the U.S. as a treatment for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;relapsing types of MS&lt;/a&gt; for more than a decade. The therapy’s mechanism of action isn’t fully understood, but it’s broadly thought to work by modulating the activity of immune cells, thereby limiting the inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;drives MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESTEEM study, completed in 2022, tracked outcomes from 5,124 patients who were treated at nearly 400 sites around the globe with at least one dose of the medication. The study’s main goal was to evaluate safety outcomes, but the treatment’s effect on MS relapses and disability progression also were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all (98.9%) of the study’s participants were specifically diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS). The study included nearly 1,500 people who started on Tecfidera after being &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/newly-diagnosed-guide-for-ms/"&gt;newly diagnosed with MS&lt;/a&gt;, and about 2,200 who had previously been on &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;interferon treatments&lt;/a&gt; or glatiramer acetate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/copaxone-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Copaxone&lt;/a&gt; and others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average duration of Tecfidera treatment was 31 months, or about 2.5 years, though some patients had more than six years of follow-up data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clinical effectiveness results reported here are, to our knowledge, from the largest and longest real-world setting study of [Tecfidera],” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS relapse rates dropped by 90% for patients on Tecfidera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half (51%) of the participants stopped taking the medication at some point during the study, with nearly 1 in 5 (22%) of them stopping Tecfidera specifically due to safety issues. The most common safety issues leading to treatment discontinuation were digestive complaints and low counts of immune cells, both of which are well-established side effects of Tecfidera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious safety issues were documented in 8%, or fewer than 400, of the patients on Tecfidera. The most common serious safety problems were infections. The researchers highlighted, however, that there was not a clear connection between low counts of immune cells and infections while on treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with rates from before starting on Tecfidera, relapse rates while on the medication were reduced by 90.1%, from 0.81 relapses per year at the study’s start to 0.08 relapses per year over six years of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data after four years also indicated that 87.6% of patients had not experienced disability worsening that was sustained for at least 48 weeks, or nearly one year. After six years, the rate of patients without sustained disability progression was similar, at 87%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, about 16.7% of participants had experienced sustained improvements in disability, meaning their symptoms were less severe, after six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety and efficacy outcomes were broadly similar across all subgroups of patients, including those who were newly diagnosed, those who had previously been on other MS treatments, and patients with milder disease. Likewise, analyses from the study overall also have indicated that the safety and efficacy of Tecfidera are &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/01/tecfidera-confirmed-safe-effective-black-hispanic-ms-patients/"&gt;consistent across racial and ethnic groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data reported in ESTEEM were overall comparable with findings from other, shorter studies of Tecfidera in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These data demonstrate that [Tecfidera] is an effective treatment option in the real-world setting, with a well-known safety record,” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Through this resource, PAHO strengthens its active surveillance efforts to prevent potential transmission of the disease to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January 1 and December 31, 2024, the platform recorded 66 confirmed human cases in the United States and one in Canada, as well as over 1,300 outbreaks in animals in various countries across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, PAHO published an &lt;a href="/en/documents/public-health-risk-assessment-associated-potential-occurrence-zoonotic-avian-influenza" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="901a64b1-ee75-4f6a-88fa-da92c9f64e8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Public health risk assessment associated with the potential occurrence of zoonotic avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b in Latin-American and the Caribbean - 6 November 2024"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; of the public health risks associated with the potential occurrence of zoonotic avian influenza A(H5N1) in Latin America and the Caribbean, classifying the risk as moderate. To date, human-to-human transmission has not been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform not only provides data on outbreaks but also on symptoms presented by patients, based on information provided by countries. This level of detail can help public health authorities be better prepared to detect and make informed, swift decisions during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO has also published a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/timeline-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; on avian influenza in the Americas, covering key events from 2020 to December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As concerns grow over the spread of this disease, the availability of accurate, real-time information is crucial for authorities to prepare, prevent new outbreaks, and protect public and animal health in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data underscores the importance of regional and global collaboration to monitor the spread of zoonotic diseases like avian influenza A(H5N1) and mitigate its potential impact.

&lt;p&gt;Murthy’s proposal accompanied a new advisory (&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) highlighting growing evidence linking alcohol consumption to several types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this call for warning labels significant, and what does the science say about the risks associated with drinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-the-us-surgeon-general-calling-for-cancer-warnings-on-alcohol-bottles-now"&gt;Why is the US surgeon general calling for cancer warnings on alcohol bottles now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current text-only alcohol warning labels, introduced in 1988, address pregnancy risks and impaired driving but fail to mention cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murthy argues these labels are outdated and insufficient given today’s understanding of alcohol’s health impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For individuals, be aware that cancer risk increases as you drink more alcohol,” Murthy wrote on Friday on the social media platform X. “As you consider whether or how much to drink, keep in mind that less is better when it comes to cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-big-a-cancer-risk-is-alcohol"&gt;How big a cancer risk is alcohol?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report (&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) from the surgeon general claims that alcohol consumption in the country is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 deaths annually. It is also the third leading preventable cause of cancer, following tobacco use and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar findings have also been published in other parts of the world. In 2018, alcohol consumption was linked to 180,000 cancer cases and 92,000 deaths in the World Health Organization’s European region, accounting for 4.2 percent of all cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, alcohol consumption is linked to 93,596 cancer cases (3.6 percent of total cases) and 78,881 cancer deaths (4.4 percent of total deaths), with men being significantly more affected than women. Women in China typically consume alcohol much less than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have also demonstrated this link. One published in the British Journal of Cancer analysed data from 572 studies involving 486,538 cancer cases, establishing alcohol as a key carcinogen that damages DNA and disrupts cell repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these concerns, public awareness remains low — only 45 percent of Americans recognise alcohol (&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) as a cancer risk, compared with 91 percent for tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-much-alcohol-does-it-take-to-raise-cancer-risk"&gt;How much alcohol does it take to raise cancer risk?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption when it comes to cancer risk. The WHO and other public health bodies stress that even small amounts can harm health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consuming two drinks per day is linked to an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer in about five out of 100 women and three out of 100 men, according to data in US surgeon general advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="will-the-warning-curb-drinking"&gt;Will the warning curb drinking?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgeon general proposes updated warning labels on alcoholic beverages, drawing parallels to cigarette warnings, which studies have linked to reduced smoking rates. However, there are some doubts over how effective text warnings are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its push for cigarette packs to carry graphic new health warnings, including pictures, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in 2019 that existing text warnings on cigarette packs, unchanged since 1984, are deemed ineffective and “virtually invisible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Timothy Naimi, director of the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, argues that warning labels serve a fundamental role in promoting transparency and consumer rights, regardless of their immediate effect on public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naimi points out that while other packaged food and beverage products are required to display detailed information — such as ingredients, calorie content, and potential health risks — alcohol labels in North America lack even basic consumer information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In most parts of the world there’s just not a lot of information about what people are consuming when it comes to alcohol,” he told Al Jazeera. “People should be allowed to make their own decisions but at least have information that’s accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Carina Ferreira-Borges, head of alcohol, drugs, and prison health at the WHO’s Europe regional office, says these types of labels play a broader role beyond individual behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol health warning labels are a systemic tool for change — they raise awareness, support broader alcohol policies, and reduce the marketing appeal of alcohol packaging,” she told Al Jazeera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-else-can-alcohol-consumption-be-curbed"&gt;How else can alcohol consumption be curbed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say additional regulatory measures would also be key to reducing consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The single most effective step would be to increase the federal excise tax on alcohol; instead Congress decreased it in 2017, and made that tax cut permanent in 2020,” said David Jernigan, professor of health law, policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that the greater value of strong labels lies in framing alcohol as “a different and potentially unhealthy product”, which could help pave the way for more effective measures, such as tax increases, to gain legislative support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;The WHO also recommends three “best buys” to reduce alcohol consumption: raising taxes, limiting marketing, and reducing physical availability, such as restricting the number of sellers and their operating hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic countries and Thailand have successfully reduced alcohol consumption by increasing taxes and restricting marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-does-drinking-alcohol-affect-your-health"&gt;How does drinking alcohol affect your health?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption increases the risk of at least seven cancers, including breast, colon, liver, mouth, throat, oesophageal, and laryngeal cancers, according to the surgeon general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens through several mechanisms such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol metabolises into acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that damages DNA, the molecules that guide how humans grow and function, and prevents cells from repairing themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormonal disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol disrupts hormone levels, particularly oestrogen, increasing breast cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorption of carcinogens:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol heightens the body’s absorption of other carcinogens, such as those found in tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="does-moderate-drinking-have-health-benefits"&gt;Does moderate drinking have health benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One widely-cited 1991 study in The Lancet introduced the “French Paradox”, suggesting that moderate wine consumption might protect against heart disease despite high-fat diets. This was supported by observational studies over the years that associated moderate drinking (one or two drinks per day) with lower cardiovascular disease rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new studies have largely debunked these claims, revealing problems in earlier research and pointing to the overall risks outweighing any potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2022 review in JAMA Network Open, which analysed 107 studies, found that previous claims about heart benefits of moderate drinking were based on flawed methodologies, particularly failure to account for “sick quitters” — people who stopped drinking due to health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naimi acknowledges that debates over whether small amounts of alcohol may benefit heart health have complicated public understanding, but says emerging evidence supports the message that drinking less is better for both heart health and cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if you believe a little bit of alcohol might be good for your heart, it’s only a very small amount — maybe a drink or two a week,” Naimi explains. Beyond very low levels, alcohol increases the risk of heart disease, including heart attacks, high blood pressure, heart failure, and irregular heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, industry voices, like Amanda Berger, senior vice president of science and research of the Distilled Spirits Council, argue that moderate drinking may have some health benefits and that any label updates should reflect a comprehensive review of scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many lifestyle choices carry potential risks, and it is the federal government’s role to determine any proposed changes to the warning statements based on the entire body of scientific research,” Berger said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferreira-Borges, the WHO representative, says the alcohol industry’s responsibility lies not in promoting responsible drinking campaigns, but in reducing the harm caused by their products through regulatory measures and reformulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol industry claims that alcohol harms are a matter of personal responsibility serve to deny the widespread nature of, and misrepresents who experiences, alcohol harms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="will-congress-approve-new-labels"&gt;Will Congress approve new labels?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the surgeon general’s advisory and new research on alcohol’s risks, Congress is unlikely to act quickly on updating warning labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last alcohol warning label, which addressed pregnancy risks and impaired driving, was approved nearly 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988, the bill was introduced in the House in September 1988 and became law within a few months. But it faced significant opposition from the alcohol industry, which argued that the warnings would be ineffective and could hurt business. The resulting labels were also relatively small and lacked detailed health warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to add a cancer warning would likely face strong opposition from the powerful alcoholic beverage industry, which spends $30m annually lobbying Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts also anticipate pushback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This seems to be one of the industry’s greatest fears – that this marks the beginning of their going down the same road as tobacco,” said Jernigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the labels are approved, alcohol use among young Americans is already declining — 49.6 percent of those aged 18-25 reported drinking in the past month in 2023, down from 59.6 percent in 2013, according to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trends among them indicate a growing preference for non-alcoholic alternatives, with movements like “Dry January” gaining traction, while social shifts may also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;“Young people are starting to drink later in life, which likely affects their later drinking years,” says Jernigan. He adds that other risky behaviours, like teen pregnancy, have also declined as teenagers increasingly connect digitally rather than in person, leading to more time spent alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera English</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:10:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOX3NGM04wajVPaU5Ld1JNLVFlN2tLbXdoV25JNVY0OENmR2I0M0dxYm1kbkwzN182Z0FEdHhfUWpzenBiOUlOWjdsenNnQkxzS2dlU1ptSUpRbGxUV1JmUnV2dHpRa0xOV2FZZmcxTmVWZGJJTlFTalJpSmwyZm9DVE0zQ241UzRndjZHRmxacEh1ZDFQa0ltNGFMTHJOcUFIMmk3dnRsU0t3dU0tQjBENNIBtgFBVV95cUxNdUxrdkZHUThpSExjUnRkYVRSVk1LVW96LWZZLUU2TXM2dnpDbE9YWUFKX2lPUHFwd19uTEdqOWJ0T1M2UmxsMS1HcURqU29CYm5HQlhlSFFCcHIwREF1TzM0NlN4YnFKOGhzMjA5T0FJbXRaUjZKOVROUC1kMkxtcmVicDNlN1JUaUxwMG85Rzl1WXF0T2dSRXpLbDJjeUg1RHU3N1hxRWR1LXU1NTNFQjE3YkxUUQ</guid></item><item><title>Sugary Drinks Linked to Global Rise in Diabetes, Heart Disease - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQWHUxMjBQN3YzWU5HMDRzZi11dWZJcnN4U3g1WVdjWTJqNEhhZ0VXQmJjUi1hZ2ZQcG85MlBwQVBnRFpDM2EyWThiRXBBV01iMDA4Uk5XVFp0dlVzazFSNktQanVieVNKbllfRlBhMDluVXp5UVlockowY0Q0Y2gwcUJxTV9aVmh3bGJKYjI1cTFFOUZUTHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Across the world, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is responsible for about 340,000 deaths each year from Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, according to a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study published&lt;/a&gt; Monday that is one of the largest attempts to assess how the spread of Western eating habits is affecting global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study, in the journal Nature, also found that sugary drinks were linked to 2.2 million additional cases of Type 2 diabetes and 1.2 million cases of cardiovascular disease in 2020, with a disproportionate share of those cases concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As it happens, those two continents have also experienced the biggest jump in the consumption of soft drinks in recent years as soda companies, faced with declining sales in North America and Europe, have sought new customers in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The estimated death toll of 340,000 is a significant increase from previous assessments of how sugar-sweetened drinks affect global health.

    &lt;p&gt;Human beings are inherently social. We thrive on connection, communication and shared experiences, which help shape our identities and foster a sense of belonging. Yet, in an increasingly digital and fast-paced world, feelings of loneliness and social isolation have become alarmingly common. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that these feelings are widespread. About 25% of older people &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/commission-on-social-connection#:%7E:text=People%20across%20all%20age%20groups,cent%20of%20adolescents%20experience%20loneliness"&gt;experience social isolation&lt;/a&gt; and 5%-15% of adolescents feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures are important since published studies have demonstrated that social isolation and loneliness are linked to increased risk of disease and death. Indeed, our own study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35676089/"&gt;published in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, found that social isolation in older people carried a 26% increased risk of developing dementia. We also found that loneliness was associated with depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to follow up our previous study by understanding the underlying biological processes behind this link between social isolation and loneliness and health. Why is loneliness so bad for our bodies and minds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exploring proteins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on proteomics, the study of proteins. This is because we know that proteins play a role in gene expression, the process by which the information encoded in a gene is turned into biological activity. Proteins are also a major source of drug targets for developing medications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collaborative study between the University of Cambridge and Fudan University, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02078-1"&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, we used data from 42,062 participants from the UK Biobank and studied 2,920 plasma proteins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association between proteins and self-reported loneliness and social isolation. We discovered that the proteins found to be significantly associated with loneliness and social isolation are also known to be implicated in inflammation as well as antiviral and immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, our study suggested that loneliness may lead to an increase in the levels of five specific proteins expressed in the brain (known as GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1). In other words, all the proteins we identified as related to loneliness were “positively associated”, meaning that people who feel lonely tend to have higher protein levels compared to those who do not feel lonely.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/640757/original/file-20250106-15-n8ahn2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Loneliness is linked to stroke and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/senior-man-hypertension-measuring-blood-pressure-2403982331"&gt;Anatoliy Cherkas/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also studied data that tracked the health of our participants for about 14 years. This found that more than half of the proteins were linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our findings, having good social relationships and not feeling lonely may promote health by reducing the levels of certain harmful proteins. However, proteins may only partly explain the link between loneliness and health. Other potential pathways, such as social stress, may also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this may be the first demonstration of how loneliness affects morbidity and mortality through its association with these five key proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Societal impacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social isolation and loneliness affect all ages and genders and leads to major mental and physical health problems. This study helps to understand how this happens on a biological level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It demonstrates how important it is to connect with others through social activities, for example volunteering or team sport. This can reduce the effects of social isolation and loneliness on the underlying biological processes important for health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technology offers new ways to stay in touch, it can sometimes lead to superficial connections that leave us feeling more disconnected than ever. This paradox — being surrounded by digital interactions yet feeling profoundly alone — underscores the importance of deep, meaningful social connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face-to-face social interactions where you also experience non-verbal communication often fosters better connections. Indeed one study showed that partners communicating face-to-face &lt;a href="https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/sites/liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/files/psychology/research/okdie_guadagno_bernieri_geers_mclarney-vesotski_2011.pdf"&gt;had more positive impressions&lt;/a&gt; than people interacting via a computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social interactions are ultimately essential for our wellbeing, boosting both physical and mental health. Social connections reduce stress, lower blood pressure and support immune function. They also enhance cognitive health and improve brain health. In addition, they can foster empathy and understanding, strengthening our minds and providing emotional resilience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, to foster a flourishing society we need to build meaningful connections with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;"There’s a good chance that a lot of people are going to get sick in the next couple of weeks," one expert predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
  

  
  
  
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;div id="articleContent" class="ar__con order-3 col-12 col-lg-7 mt-3 px-md-6"&gt;

    

    

    
    
    &lt;p class="truth-c35079dca79df117498591a6b6fe4828 truth-post-content-before" id="truth-c35079dca79df117498591a6b6fe4828"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of coronavirus across the U.S. are increasing at higher levels than usual, an unexpected surge that is leading some health experts to state that the COVID-19 pandemic is “still ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By all measures of the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/covid-surges-us-low-booster-uptake"&gt;COVID rates are rising rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, with notable increases in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospitalizations in general, as well as deaths and wastewater monitoring indicators. What’s worse, only one-fifth of Americans have received the latest round of boosters for coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rates appear to be increasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/health/covid-holiday-surge-us/index.html"&gt;as more people have been gathering for end-of-year holiday celebrations&lt;/a&gt; without taking proper precautions to guard against COVID. Trends for the virus began to shift at the start of December, just after the Thanksgiving holiday, with rates steadily increasing up to the week of December 21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="truth-4fa47cb7f29048e38e1d270e028225b1 truth-post-content-high" id="truth-4fa47cb7f29048e38e1d270e028225b1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those trends are likely to continue: A forecasting model for COVID estimates that an individual attending a Christmas gathering of 10 people has a 1 in 8 chance of COVID exposure. For a person who traveled on a plane of 100 people to reach their holiday destination late last month, that likelihood of exposure increased to a 3 in 4 chance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a good chance that a lot of people are going to get sick in the next couple of weeks and be unaware of it,” said Michael Hoerger, professor at Tulane University School of Medicine, speaking to &lt;em&gt;NBC’s &lt;/em&gt;“The Today Show” about the matter. “Most people are not tracking CDC data, and so their only way of knowing whether we’re in a wave is if they’ve gotten sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The COVID pandemic is still ongoing. It’s still dangerous. … As this new administration comes about, everyone in public health and in public health communication has to be just exceedingly clear” that COVID is still a threat, said Yale School of Public Health biostatistician Jeffrey Townsend, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/covid-surges-us-low-booster-uptake"&gt;speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the rising rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the incoming Donald Trump administration — most notably, Trump’s nominee to become head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — is unlikely to heed these warnings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy specifically &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/trump-picks-conspiracy-theorist-rfk-jr-to-oversee-the-countrys-public-health/"&gt;has pushed a number of falsehoods and conspiracy theories relating to coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, including conspiracy theories based on racism. Kennedy once claimed, for example, that COVID targets “Caucasians and Black people” and that the “most immune” people to the virus were “Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/trump-picks-conspiracy-theorist-rfk-jr-to-oversee-the-countrys-public-health/"&gt;Kennedy has also peddled the lie that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe and ineffective&lt;/a&gt;, despite trustworthy data repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/is-the-covid19-%20vaccine-safe"&gt;showing the opposite is true&lt;/a&gt;. By pushing these falsehoods, Kennedy and the Trump administration could do significant harm to the American populace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If RFK has a significant influence on the next administration, that could further erode people’s willingness to get up to date with recommended vaccines,” &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/trump-picks-conspiracy-theorist-rfk-jr-to-oversee-the-countrys-public-health/"&gt;former Surgeon General Jerome Adams said last fall&lt;/a&gt;. “I am worried about the impact that could have on our nation’s health, on our nation’s economy, on our global security.”&lt;/p&gt;

Whether through miscarriage, stillbirth or the birth of a child with defects incompatible with life, these losses are profoundly devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CFEKZX6AP5G53MVWQ33IZBBCZM"&gt;One of the most painful aspects for many of these women is the response -- or lack of response -- from their friends and loved ones. Too often, people avoid the grieving mother entirely. It’s not because they don’t care but because they simply don’t know what to say. Tragically, when they do say something, it can often be unintentionally hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RCN3BGDNINDYRDXZFWM6QWNE5M"&gt;Phrases like, “You can always have another one” or “He (or she) is in a better place” or, “It was God’s will” may be well-intentioned, but they can diminish the profound grief and invalidate feelings of loss. These statements unintentionally communicate that the life that was lost is replaceable or that the grieving person should simply accept the tragedy and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BCTCED45UNFEBA7PT2DOGKO77M"&gt;From my experience, the best response is often the simplest: “I’m so sorry for your loss.” Acknowledging the pain without trying to fix it or explain it away is far more meaningful. This small gesture tells the grieving person that their loss matters, that their child’s life -- however brief -- was significant, and that they are not alone in their grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZQAUJ3KFPZCKXNUGD4BEWDUH6M"&gt;Pregnancy loss is an emotional and often isolating experience, and a little compassion and sensitivity can make a world of difference to someone who is grieving. If nothing else, we should strive to offer our presence and our willingness to listen without judgment or advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SFGHZ5HRBZCRVCSK36B7VIWPVQ"&gt;Thank you for providing a platform for these kinds of conversations. I hope this perspective will help others feel more confident in supporting loved ones during such difficult times. -- Baby MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IJOLEZD7AFAXRBHVN2JAOEGXDQ"&gt;DEAR BABY MD: Thank you so much for your letter.

Nearly one-third of all new diabetes cases in Mexico were linked to sugary drinks, which were also connected to more than a quarter (27.6%) of new diabetes cases and 14.6% of cases of cardiovascular disease in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sugary drinks are rapidly digested, causing a spike in blood-sugar levels with little nutritional value. Drinking them regularly over time leads to weight gain, insulin resistance and a host of metabolic issues tied to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dariush Mozaffarian, one of the paper’s authors and director of Tuft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt; is Medicine Institute, said: “Sugar-sweetened beverages are heavily marketed and sold in low- and middle-income nations.

Mexico, which has one of the highest rates of sugary drink consumption in the world, &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_8/e012227" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;introduced a tax&lt;/a&gt; on the beverages in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Much more needs to be done, especially in countries in Latin America and Africa where consumption is high and the health consequence severe,” said Mozaffarian. “As a species, we need to address sugar-sweetened beverage consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxNVWYtbGJTWDlzSkdzUDBKYjhCRUFjSWotcFNYcngybVhIeEF2MkRCck1oTkhiSEFfTTdza2hfck12OUxBemw1LXVFWjRhN2luWUNHMjBoMDdJbUtPRWZSQkg5S3c1cDNsZWVPSmllU3lBZXptenhXazJlTWN2M0JrTkE3VnVRaVFlQlcyUFBRTjlUN0g1VnJZUDFpcE9MTVdRN0FaS2xMUmZubDZoYng0ZUdiXzFscklCSTJmeng1cUZpVTdPX3doeUZLSDVrUFFBd2NMcGl5QW44OGwzQzFpdTFXYnpfRVJ2VXV3</guid></item><item><title>Chlamydia and syphilis infections PLUNGE in US by 80 per cent thanks to 'Morning-after pill for STIs' - but th - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUjRaSmpvTzFkUUgtaG16eS16aTEtOG1QdG5URUpTWHV4eUhvc1B4eDJWdDhjT3B1eHM1d1dEQUp0VG5QOXp6bVEwbW9IamtGdlBtdG5MSjZfWW1ucWZXbmF4MXRqT01jdGhYWHBVb1E1MHF0dVVZQ3U0WXh2ZFBYUVpLQk53ZnNTcTBnRG9ibTZvN01NaEdsZXhQM3UtcGp5V1BxR2JZRnBGZTTSAbABQVVfeXFMTk5pcmhLX2pUdk53T1hBc09lTUFiMldEcU5IVFNBbmtiblhyYUdmU19rYXZPb0M0NlRvU2hGUTBlOG5WZk1RV21Qbmd3enk0LVprUmxwc1UwcU1XTTJKMW1MQXA0cDhXRjJpTUQtb0FCQ2hyS3hJRHpyeFdfNmlvbHJkQks4clJTMnJLaHBUMThxX0hfMWVtZUNkNnlRcEdFRzRGRTI4VV81UnFNaGlMWFM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 'morning after pill' could slash soaring rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), new research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who took the common antibiotic, doxycycline, within 72 hours of having sex cut their chances of contracting syphilis and chlamydia by up to 80 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggested it could be a vital new weapon in the fight against rising STIs if unlikely to impact on antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;STI rates have surged in recent years in the UK and America, with changing sexual behaviours and treatment resistance believed to be behind the increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rising divorce rates, the emergence of erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra, dating apps and the growth of retirement villages have seen infections increase in middle aged and older groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns have also been raised about children copying what they see in pornography, freely accessed on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend has led to calls for new strategies to address poor sexual health, particularly among older generations who may have missed out on safe sex education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the first 'real world' study of doxycyclines potential as an STI prevention, researchers from Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute in the US gave it to 2,253 people already taking preventative &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-407e6650-cc45-11ef-8fb4-cd44f14f4b8e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; medication, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who took the common antibiotic, doxycycline, within 72 hours of having sex cut their chances of contracting syphilis and chlamydia by up to 80 per cent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They looked at STI test results before and after taking the pills, also known as doxyPEP, to understand how it may have affected risk of acquiring STIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that incidence declined by 79 per cent for chlamydia, 80 per cent for syphilis, and 12 per cent for gonorrhoea, according to the findings published in JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Costing just a few pence, doxycycline is given on the NHS to people to treat bacterial conditions such as chest and dental infections, as well as STIs syphilis and chlamydia once they have an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not yet used in the UK as a preventative treatment, despite growing noise surrounding it as a viable option for STI reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK sexual health chiefs were said to be considering guidance but are concerned about the potential for drug-resistant strains of infections to emerge if the antibiotics is more widely used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were 401,800 new STIs diagnosed in England last year, up 4.7 per cent from 383,789 in 2022, according to the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sharpest year-on-year rise was among children aged 13 and 14, where the number was up by almost a fifth (19.5 per cent) to 459.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was followed by pensioners aged 65 and over, with new cases soaring by 18.2 per cent to 2,885.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rate per 100,000 people for the total number of syphilis cases recorded in the US since the 1940s.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A varied diet rich in vegetables is known to be healthy for one's well-being. Excessive consumption of meat, especially red meat, can lead to chronic and cardiovascular diseases. That is also because what we eat shapes the gut microbiome. At the same time, excluding certain foods, such as dairy or animal products, is not necessarily a general solution to achieve microbial balance. But can we find out which food products determine differences in the gut microbiome?&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Starting from this question, a group of researchers has analyzed biological samples from 21,561 individuals (vegans, vegetarians and omnivores) living in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, and found that the dietary pattern has a strong influence on the gut &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and on specific gut microbes that are associated with better health. The data is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01870-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome, the set of microorganisms that inhabit our intestine, plays a crucial role in determining a person's health, as it influences many aspects, from digestion to the immune response. So far, only a few large-scale studies have examined how different diets impact the composition of gut &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study focused in particular on the differences and consequences of different diets on the microbiome. The results show that diet patterns shape the gut microbiome, as they not only determine the microbes necessary for digestion, but also the acquisition of microbes directly from the food itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As more and more people adopt &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vegan/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vegetarian+diets/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vegetarian diets&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to find out how different their microbiomes are and which microorganisms are responsible for these differences," explains Gloria Fackelmann, first author of the study and researcher at the Cibio Department at Italy's University of Trento. The group that conducted this research, which also includes scholars from King's College London, was coordinated by Nicola Segata, professor of Genetics and head of the Computational metagenomics laboratory of the Cibio Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of the analyses, performed at the Metagenomics Laboratory of the Cibio Department, on average vegans have the healthiest diets, followed by vegetarians and omnivores. However, the most interesting data emerged from the study of the diversity of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;; that is, by measuring the variety of bacteria that inhabit our intestines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was less diversity in vegetarians and vegans than in omnivores, but scientists point out that diversity alone is not a reliable means to determine the health of the microbiome, as it does not take into account the quality and functionality of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The microbial signatures of vegan, vegetarian and omnivorous diets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of the study was to examine the differences between gut microbiomes. The researchers were able to see how each dietary pattern leads to a unique microbial signature. The microbiomes of omnivores have an increased presence of bacteria associated with meat digestion, such as Alistipes putredinis, involved in protein fermentation. Omnivores also have more bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease and an increased risk of colon cancer, such as Ruminococcus torques and Bilophila wadsworthia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiomes of vegans differ in the number of bacteria involved in fiber fermentation, such as several species in the Bacteroides and Firmicutes phyla, which help produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate. These compounds have beneficial effects on gut health, as they reduce inflammation and maintain a better homeostatic balance with our metabolism and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the main single difference between vegetarians and vegans is the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus in the microbiome of vegetarians, a bacterium found mainly in dairy products and used in the production of yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Healthy diet and healthy microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlighted that it is the quality of the diet—rather than the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+pattern/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary pattern&lt;/a&gt; itself—that influences the composition of the microbiome. People with healthier dietary patterns, whether vegan, vegetarian or omnivorous, showed a more favorable microbiome composition. This suggests that regardless of the type of diet, eating more plant-based foods and fewer animal-based foods, especially if highly processed, can be good for gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Another innovative aspect of the research was the study of how bacteria transfer from food to the microbiome. The scientists found that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vegans/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vegans&lt;/a&gt; had the fewest food-associated bacteria in the microbiome, except for those derived from fruits and vegetables, which were most present. Vegetarians and omnivores, on the other hand, showed a greater number of bacteria linked to dairy products, especially fermented ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have observed," emphasizes Nicola Segata, "that the quantity and diversity of plant-based foods have a very positive impact on the microbiome. Avoiding meat or dairy products does not necessarily have a positive effect if it does not come with a variety of quality plant-based products. From the point of view of the microbiome, what we can generally recommend is that it is important to eat many plant-based foods, especially those rich in fiber. And that food diversity is important."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is part of a larger project that aims to identify the benefits of a certain diet based on the specific microbiome of each person or group of people, especially in terms of cardiometabolic health: the so-called precision nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

However, a study published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.4352"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals potential developmental risks. Children exposed to cannabis in utero scored lower on attention and planning tasks and showed increased aggression during observational assessments, suggesting prenatal exposure may disrupt critical areas of cognitive and behavioral development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use among pregnant individuals in the United States has doubled over the past two decades, rising from 3.4% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2021. This increase is partly fueled by perceptions of cannabis as a safe, natural remedy for pregnancy-related issues like nausea and mood disorders. Despite recommendations from major medical organizations to avoid cannabis during pregnancy, many clinicians struggle to provide consistent guidance due to limited evidence on long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked prenatal cannabis exposure to deficits in executive function—critical cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and problem-solving—as well as behavioral challenges like aggression. However, much of the existing research relies on data from cohorts studied decades ago or uses caregiver-reported outcomes that may be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, advances in technology have recently enabled more precise, computerized assessments of early executive function, creating an opportunity for more nuanced investigations. The new study aimed to address these gaps by employing rigorous methods to examine the relationship between prenatal cannabis exposure and specific behavioral and cognitive outcomes in preschool-aged children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed the legal environment related to cannabis use was changing rapidly, but the research to understand the potential effects of use during pregnancy had not been updated to keep pace. We thought that it was important that pregnant people and health care providers that work with them should have more recent evidence,” explained Sarah A. Keim, an associate professor at The Ohio State University and principal investigator in the Center for Biobehavioral Health at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the study using data from the Lifestyle and Early Achievement in Families (LEAF) cohort, a group derived from the Ohio Perinatal Research Network. This repository included data from pregnant individuals who received care at a medical center in Ohio between 2010 and 2016. Participants provided detailed information about their health, substance use, and environmental factors during pregnancy and consented to follow-up studies involving their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, 250 children aged five participated in behavioral assessments at a research facility. Eighty children had been exposed to cannabis during pregnancy, as determined through maternal self-reports, clinical records, and urine tests detecting a metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabis’s psychoactive component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study assessed executive function through various laboratory-based tasks, including computerized tests measuring attention, inhibitory control, and planning ability. For instance, one test involved the “Tower of Hanoi” puzzle, which evaluates planning skills. Aggression was measured through observational methods, such as the Bobo Doll task, where children’s physical interactions with a doll were recorded. Caregivers also completed questionnaires about their children’s behaviors and cognitive abilities. To control for confounding factors, the researchers used statistical techniques that accounted for maternal education, household income, and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found significant differences between children who were exposed to cannabis prenatally and those who were not. On laboratory-based tests, cannabis-exposed children scored lower on attention and inhibitory control, key components of executive function. They also demonstrated poorer planning ability. Observational assessments revealed that cannabis-exposed children displayed more aggressive behaviors, such as hitting a doll’s face with a closed fist during the Bobo Doll task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found prenatal cannabis exposure was associated in early childhood with poorer thinking skills and behaviors such as impulse control, paying attention, planning ability, and more aggressive behavior, all of which play a vital role in how children perform in school and interact with others,” Keim told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these patterns did not appear in caregiver-reported measures of children’s behavior. Caregivers of cannabis-exposed and non-exposed children rated their children similarly on attention, planning, and aggression. This discrepancy highlights the value of using multiple methods to assess developmental outcomes, as caregiver perceptions may not fully capture behavioral differences observed in structured settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with prior research suggesting that cannabis exposure during pregnancy may affect the development of the frontal lobe, a brain region critical for executive function. The study also adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that behavioral challenges linked to prenatal cannabis exposure can emerge as early as preschool, a critical period for cognitive and social development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were not surprising – they actually confirm and expand on longstanding evidence from previous research from several decades ago,” Keim said. “With our more contemporary and diverse sample of women and children, and with much higher potency of cannabis now than in past decades, this study validates previous research and supports existing clinical recommendations for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study did not account for the timing or dosage of cannabis use, which may influence outcomes. As cannabis becomes increasingly potent and widely available, understanding its impact on child development remains a critical area for ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by incorporating more precise measures of cannabis exposure, such as biomarkers that track cumulative exposure, and by exploring how factors like dose and timing impact outcomes. Longitudinal studies that follow children into later childhood and adolescence could provide a clearer picture of the long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently studying outcomes among these children at age 7 to see how they develop,” Keim said. “We found in qualitative research that we conducted that some women believe that because cannabis comes from a plant that it must be safe, or safer than many pharmaceuticals. This is simply not true. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both caution against cannabis use during pregnancy because of possible health risks to mothers and children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.4352"&gt;Prenatal Cannabis Exposure and Executive Function and Aggressive Behavior at Age 5 Years&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah A. Keim, Peter Fried, Keith Owen Yeates, Kelly M. Boone, Daphne M. Vrantsidis, Abigail Dean, Aaron W. Murnan, Joseph Rausch, and Mark A.

Oddly enough, our ancient ancestors didn’t have as many issues with cavities, even without modern dental tools. This curious case points to how much our diet has influenced tooth decay over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Did They Find in Ireland?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an intriguing dig, scientists found two teeth belonging to someone from the &lt;strong&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/strong&gt;, roughly between &lt;strong&gt;2280 and 2140 B.C.&lt;/strong&gt; These teeth came from a limestone cave in County Limerick, southwest Ireland, during excavations from &lt;strong&gt;1993 to 1996&lt;/strong&gt;. Even after all these years, the teeth offered some eye-opening insights into the bacteria of yesteryears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teeth had loads of &lt;strong&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/strong&gt;, a bacterium we know today for causing cavities. Even though the enamel was intact, S. mutans hinted at possible cavity development. Other teeth at the site showed signs of decay too, but since the skeletons were mixed up, it wasn’t clear if they belonged to that same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Finding Streptococcus mutans is Such a Big Deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotting &lt;strong&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/strong&gt; in ancient teeth is pretty rare because this bacterium tends to mess up DNA with its acid production. It’s hard to find due to less sugary diets before farming became common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some older studies did find small amounts of S. mutans in things like a Neolithic tooth from southwest France and an old Scandinavian “chewing gum.” These finds highlight how much our eating habits have changed and affected our oral bacteria over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Our Diets Changed Bacteria Over Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shed light on how major dietary shifts in recent centuries have shaped S. mutans’ evolution. Eating more sugar made life easier for this bacterium in our mouths. Notably, there was a population boom for S. mutans after medieval times because of these food changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparative research shows that more refined sugar available during the &lt;strong&gt;19th century&lt;/strong&gt; led to higher cavity rates. Observations also point out that cavities became more common after people started farming cereals around &lt;strong&gt;10,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Happened to Our Mouth Bacteria Over Time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;strong&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/strong&gt; back in 2013 talked about how changing diets altered oral bacteria make-up through time. Harmful bacteria like S. mutans began taking over from friendlier types that kept things balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bacterium found was &lt;strong&gt;Tannerella forsythia&lt;/strong&gt;, linked to gum diseases and showing more diversity in old microbiomes compared to today’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Should We Care About All This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in microbial diversity we’re seeing now raises flags about human health impacts. Prehistoric mouth microbiomes were way more diverse than what we’ve got today—a fact that might explain some diseases common among Western populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts like Lara Cassidy at Trinity College Dublin stress understanding how recent diet changes affect both mouth and gut microbiomes—key insights needed for tackling today’s health problems tied directly or indirectly to microbial imbalances caused by modern sugary and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Louise Humphrey from London’s Natural History Museum says: “Higher caries rates correlate with increased availability”—a reminder that our choices can heavily influence not just our own health but maybe future generations’ too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dive into ancient dental health offers both a fascinating look back at history and pushes us forward—to better grasp what healthy living truly means amidst today’s ever-evolving food norms.&lt;/p&gt;

She was idly running her fingers through the dirt when she saw a red head dart from between the stones and felt a sharp sting on her right index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Never a crier, she ran to her father, David Mutunga, who was building a fence. He cut the cloth belt on her dress into strips with a machete, tied her arm in three places and rushed her to a hospital 30 minutes away on a motorcycle taxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the day stretched on, her finger grew darker, but the hospital in Mwingi, a small town in Kenya, had no antidote for that kind of venom. Finally that evening in November 2023, she was taken by ambulance to another hospital and injected with antivenom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When the finger blistered, swelled and turned black despite a second dose the next day, “I understood that they will now remove that part,” Mr. Mutunga said with tears in his eyes. Beatrice’s finger was amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In Kenya, India, Brazil and dozens of other countries, snakes vie for the same land, water and sometimes food as people, with devastating consequences.

In fact, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.03.018" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; of studies on this topic found that average weight gains around the holiday season are around 1 to 3 pounds (0.5 to 1.3 kilograms), though those who are overweight or obese tend to gain more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;There’s likely more going on with year-end weight gain than just overindulgence in abundant holiday treats. In our ancestral past, in many places, winter meant that food became more scarce. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602346" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wintertime reductions in exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Wintertime reductions in exercise&lt;/a&gt; and increases in how much and what people eat may have been an evolutionary adaptation to this scarcity. If the ancestors who had these reactions to colder, winter environments were at an advantage, evolutionary processes would make sure the adaptations were passed on to their descendants, coded into our genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sex, generosity and focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Beyond these winter-related shifts in mood and waistlines, the season brings with it a number of other changes in how people think and interact with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;One less discussed seasonal effect is that people seem to get friskier in the winter months. Researchers know this from analyses of condom sales, sexually transmitted disease rates and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-012-9996-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:internet searches for pornography and prostitution;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;internet searches for pornography and prostitution&lt;/a&gt;, all of which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00871.x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:show biannual cycles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;show biannual cycles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.1993.9940826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:peaking in the late summer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;peaking in the late summer&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/014107689909200204" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the winter months;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in the winter months&lt;/a&gt;. Data on birth rates also shows that in the United States and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, babies are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/tis-the-season-for-conception-106663" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more likely to be conceived in the winter months;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more likely to be conceived in the winter months&lt;/a&gt; than at other times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Although this phenomenon is widely observed, the reason for its existence is unclear. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/09654280810842120" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers have suggested many explanations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Researchers have suggested many explanations&lt;/a&gt;, including health advantages for infants born in late summer, when food may historically have been more plentiful, changes in sex hormones altering libido, desires for intimacy motivated by the holiday season, and simply increased opportunities to engage in sex. However, changes in sexual opportunities are likely not the whole story, given that winter brings not just increased sexual behaviors, but greater &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-012-9996-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:desire and interest in sex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;desire and interest in sex&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Winter boosts more than sex drive. Studies find that during this time of year, people may have an easier time paying attention at school or work. Neuroscientists in Belgium found that performance on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518129113" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tasks measuring sustained attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tasks measuring sustained attention&lt;/a&gt; was best during the wintertime. Research suggests that seasonal changes in levels of serotonin and dopamine driven by less exposure to daylight may help explain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518129113" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shifts in cognitive function during winter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shifts in cognitive function during winter&lt;/a&gt;. Again, there are parallels with other animals – for instance, African striped mice &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-015-0892-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:navigate mazes better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;navigate mazes better&lt;/a&gt; during winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;And there may also be a kernel of truth to the idea of a generous Christmas spirit. In countries where the holiday is widely celebrated, rates of charitable giving tend to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2018.07.004" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:show a sizable increase around this time of year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;show a sizable increase around this time of year&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2013.10.014" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people become more generous tippers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;people become more generous tippers&lt;/a&gt;, leaving about 4% more for waitstaff during the holiday season. This tendency is likely not due to snowy surroundings or darker days, but instead a response to the altruistic values associated with winter holidays that encourage behaviors like generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;People change with the seasons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Like many other animals, we too are seasonal creatures. In the winter, people eat more, move less and mate more. You may feel a bit more glum, while also being kinder to others and having an easier time paying attention. As psychologists and other scientists research these kinds of seasonal effects, it may turn out that the ones we know about so far are only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/us?utm_source=Yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=related-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related-link-0&amp;amp;utm_content=article-217350" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

It was genetic, but no one would learn that for nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman writes: 'This meant that Diane’s illness was genetic and wasn’t a complication of a viral infection, as doctors formerly assumed. Instead, Diane transmitted a deadly gene to Karen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had to find the mutation before God’s cruel game of Russian roulette picked off more members of the family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tragedy, nearly a year after her father's sudden fatal heart attack at 66, prompted the 78-year-old to use her expertise as a geneticist to find an answer. She pored over research and corresponded with experts in the field about the latest discoveries in the variations of human DNA that make a person who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman soon learned many members of her family had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-3957620/One-100-healthy-people-carry-faulty-gene-linked-deadly-heart-condition.html"&gt;inherited a potentially lethal&lt;/a&gt; gene mutation responsible for making a protein crucial for maintaining the function and structure of muscle cells, including those that make up the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Susan Weiss Liebman's new book The Dressmaker’s Mirror, is both a memoir and genetic exploration, tracing generations of her family marked by sudden deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Dr Liebman was a child, she heard the story of the untimely death of her father's brother, Eugene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eugene was just four years old when he was crushed to death by a falling mirror in 1916.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Family members tried to lift the mirror off him, but it was too late and the story haunted Dr Liebman for decades - until she learned it was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The four-year-old’s death certificate said nothing of an accident, a mirror, or being crushed. In reality, the child had died of congestive heart failure following a five-day hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death wasn't a freak accident. He had inherited a killer gene that later took Dr Liebman’s grandmother, father and niece, among others in her family tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her father never knew the family’s grim secret and she didn't learn the truth until she had already been an accomplished geneticist for three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had always considered genetics in terms of my career. I studied it as an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and the University of Rochester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I understood that genetics determined my eye and hair color, my handedness, and other traits, but I never thought that it would have a significant impact on my actual life. Now that all changed.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Liebman's niece Karen is pictured with her husband Andrew. The couple is showing off Karen's baby bump just one day before her freak deadly heart attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hunt for the culprit took years and several rounds of tests of Dr Liebman's and her sister Diane's DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With each test, they came out with no answers. There were no red flags or clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until Diane passed away in 2016 at 73 of heart failure that the puzzle pieces began to fall into place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genomics is constantly evolving. With advances in technology come more effective ways of exploring genes in greater detail and identifying previously unknown genes or gene variants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sisters had provided blood samples to geneticists now working at Northwestern University before Diane's death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Dr Liebman reached out to them asking about the potential genetic link to her condition, Northwestern cardiologist Dr Beth McNally delivered the news that scientists had found a gene variation in Diane's DNA that had previously never been linked to cardiomyopathy - but it could be the answer now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McNally said at the time of the discovery that Diane's gene was the only one that had been linked to cardiomyopathy. But, as years went on and more reports potentially linked the gene and the disease, it 'makes it more likely that this may be a real association.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman and her family are Jewish, a population at a higher risk for having the mutation that makes them more prone to fatal cardiac conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is Dr Liebman's father [left] who died when he was 66 of a heart attack, next to his brother Cyrus. Their father David sits on the far right. He died at 41&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I recently completed &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32805325/"&gt;a small research study&lt;/a&gt; that asked if the mutation in my family is a major cause of DCM among Ashkenazi Jews. Our results suggest it is,' Dr Liebman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mutation &lt;span&gt;changed a crucial section of DNA. In some cases, Dr Liebman explained, this can lead to a premature stop in the production of a certain protein, which can contribute to potentially deadly heart diseases like DCM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she learned of the faulty gene, which she believes was passed down through her father’s side, she alerted everyone in her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I contacted all first and second cousins who, respectively, had a 12 percent and 6 percent chance of having the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Those who knew of my niece Karen’s death were at once interested. Those whom I didn’t know and didn’t know Karen were sometimes skeptical about the relevance of my information and at first thought I might be part of a scam.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman also found out that neither she nor her children carried this deadly gene mutation - meaning they could no longer pass the gene on to future generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, Dr Liebman thought, they had an answer for the untimely deaths that had plagued her family for generations. Finally, they could know for sure whether future generations of their family faced similar fates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DCM does not have to be fatal. It can be managed with proper heart-healthy lifestyle factors, regular checkups, echocardiograms, and medications such as beta-blockers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Liebman is pictured with her husband Alan at their wedding reception in 1969&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her genetic exploration, Dr Liebman was made to reconcile her ancestral faith with the tragedies that had befallen them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Arad of Tel Aviv University, whose team had identified 23 mutations in the new faulty gene, told her the families he had seen with the mutation were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent just like Dr Liebman and her family, making it a Founder gene - a gene in the DNA of a small ancestral population that is passed down to a large number of offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His research found some people who died suddenly had shown no signs of imminent death on echocardiograms, the standard method for gauging the heart’s electrical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All Ashkenazi Jews descend from a small population of less than 500 people in Eastern Europe whose genetic origins were equally split between Europe and the Levant, which today covers parts of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, and parts of Turkey and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Remarkably,’ she said,’ the mutation in my family occurred in one out of 800 Ashkenazi Jews but was not present in the other ethnic populations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the small population reproduced with each other, the faulty gene mutation spread in their offspring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While once confused as to why the family would lie about Eugene's death more than a century ago, Dr Liebman now understands his mother hid the truth because she didn't want her sons to be ostracized and without marriage prospects due to the known risk of passing along their condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman wrote: ‘Marion’s imaginary shattered mirror and the resulting broken glass shards embody her perceptive fears for her family’s future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Marion's fears for her family proved prophetic, as premature deaths plagued her descendants, including her own at 59, her mother at 47, her son at 66, and later generations suffering from heart-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite Marion’s premonition, there was nothing she could do.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lack of autopsies for Marion and her son obscured the genetic connection to DCM, which might have saved future lives through earlier awareness and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Liebman continued: 'Grandma Marion modeled for us how to deal with loss by choosing life in response to heartbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What she couldn’t have known was that we would learn the cause of all the deaths, and that this would allow genetic testing and early treatment to end the family curse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not much of a secret that there’s a lot of misinformation that claims to have a basis in scientific fact — climate change isn’t real, the Earth is flat. I cringe at some of the nutrition and health information I come across that’s questionable at best, patently false or even dangerous at worst. And if I were to make predictions for 2025, I would say that, given some of the nominees floated for health-related government positions, misinformation and pseudoscience are going to become even more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscience is a claim for or an explanation of an observed phenomenon that’s presented as science despite lacking scientific rigor. If there is any published research that appears to support a pseudoscientific claim, its invariably flawed, perhaps due to a faulty premise or bad study design. It may have appeared in a low-quality scientific journal that has had to retract an unusually high number of articles after publication. Other pseudoscientific claims may be based on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry-picking of published research results (ignoring research that rebuts the claim)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Anecdotal “evidence”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unreasonable extrapolation of results from cell- or animal-based research to humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Human research that’s inconclusive or very preliminary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These claims can appear to make sense because they’re bolstered by a science-y sounding mix of jargon and buzzwords. It’s no surprise that even otherwise educated and intelligent people seeking solutions for real or perceived nutrition and health problems fall for this misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s “post-truth” era, the flames of pseudoscience and misinformation have a lot more oxygen, and social media has made it easier than ever for someone to say anything they want and find an audience that will share it. Nutrition pseudoscience in particular is getting worse, with many people operating in the “wellness” space giving their opinion like it’s fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k822.long" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a 2018 analysis of the state of nutrition science&lt;/a&gt;, two professors from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University wrote: “Almost everyone seems to have an opinion on food and nutrition … We all eat, interacting with our food multiple times each day over a lifetime, making food and nutrition seem tangible and accessible. Yet opinion is not always based on science, and often the loudest, most extreme voices drown out the well informed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t help that &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/what-does-a-healthy-diet-look-like-heres-some-levelheaded-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link"&gt;evidence-based advice to eat a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, be physically active, and get enough sleep may not seem very sexy, whereas fear-based pseudoscientific claims (“Eat this food and you’ll destroy your health!”) grab our attention. That attention also sells products and increases social media engagement, giving peddlers of misinformation incentive to keep peddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ever-evolving nature of science — good science involves asking questions, conducting a well-designed research study, then using the resulting new knowledge to ask new questions, then repeat, repeat, repeat — can itself become fuel for promoters of pseudoscience, who claim that researchers and other science-based nutrition and health professionals are changing the story, making things up, or don’t know anything to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking it’s the Wild West out there, you’re not wrong. So think critically about what you see online and on social media. What are the credentials of the person who is talking? What evidence do they cite? Does the claim contradict established information? Are they selling expensive supplements or products? Are they promoting conspiracy theories? As we move into 2025, I’ll be diligently watching for — and calling out — nutrition and health misinformation. You can always send me an email if you see a bit of information that seems not quite right. I just might write about it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January is a great time to think about instilling good habits for the year ahead. That said, there is no point making overly ambitious resolutions that are impossible to keep. So, instead of setting unobtainable goals, try these bitesized, realistically sustainable good habits. They are mostly cheap, many are free, and every one of them is either backed by studies or, at the very least, has been tried and tested by experts in the relevant field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve compiled a list of 31 good habits – one for every day of January, so grab a pen and get ready to tick them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWAP GELS FOR DATES &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Natural food such as dates and dried apricots are more easily and healthily digested according to Alan Murchison, author of The Cycling Chef. “The body just isn’t accustomed to a number of irregularly ingested, sweet liquid shots that bypass much of the system and provide massive boosts of energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKIP LATE NIGHT HARD INTERVALS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;If you want to get your eight hours of sleep, don’t train hard late in the evening.

Three questions to ask yourself are: one, what did I do well?; two, what could I have done better?; three, what do I want to focus on in my next ride?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAVE A PROTEIN NIGHT CAP &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;“Having &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/protein-for-cyclists-33501" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/protein-for-cyclists-33501"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; before sleep provides a key opportunity to boost muscle mass and strength, recovery and overall metabolism,” states sports nutritionist Anita Bean. “According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition, consuming 30-40g of casein protein 30 minutes before sleep, combined with regular resistance training, can increase muscle protein synthesis throughout the night.” Good pre-sleep options include a protein shake or plain Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with your body weight, then build up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQUAT &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;If you’re a newbie to resistance training, start using your bodyweight before progressing to gym weights. Squatting hones movement patterns, helping to avoid injury and the muscle soreness that can negatively impact riding. “Begin with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width and rotated out five to 10 degrees,” says endurance strength specialist Chris Panayiotou. “Squat as if sitting back into a chair, maintaining control as you lower. Do eight to 10 reps per set.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UP YOUR OMEGA-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The UK government recommends meeting the minimum consumption of omega-3 oils by eating at least two portions of (preferably oily) fish a week. But according to sports nutritionist Anita Bean, athletes require more to help increase muscle protein synthesis. Up your intake of flax seeds, walnuts or salmon, or pick a supplement looking for ‘EPA’ and ‘DHA’ on the label. A daily dose of 1-3g of EPA and DHA – we need both – has been recommended for athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most riders opt to take their naps at home, but whatever works for you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE A NAP &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The journal Sports Medicine conducted a systematic review to assess the benefits of daytime napping on “physical and cognitive performance” in physically active participants. It found improvements in endurance performance, reaction time, attention and short-term memory.

This is almost twice that of the official recommended daily allowance (RDA) for the general population. The research recommends distributing these protein doses evenly throughout the day, every three to four hours. Suggestions for these doses include a handful of peanuts (7g), three tablespoons of low-fat strained Greek yogurt (15g) or a chicken breast (39g).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PULL A PIGEON POSE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;“If their hips are tight, riders are unable to ride in an aero position, and other parts of the body compensate for the lack of movement,” says cycling coach and ex-bike fitter James Walsgrove. “They end up with excessive lateral knee travel.

The ‘sunshine vitamin’ also helps the body absorb calcium, and may be important for boosting the immune system, as well as having a role in muscle contractions. The NHS recommends everyone take a daily supplement containing 10mcg (400IU) during autumn and winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEX YOUR SPINE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Maintain mobility by doing the Rolling Bridge. Lie on your back with your legs bent and lifted above you.

This discovery explains why some people with disease-causing mutations experience no symptoms and may pave the way for new treatments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New research uncovers why certain individuals with disease-causing genes remain symptom-free.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/columbia-university/"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is a private Ivy League research university in New York City that was established in 1754. This makes it the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States. It is often just referred to as Columbia, but its official name is Columbia University in the City of New York.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have challenged a fundamental principle of genetics, uncovering why some individuals carrying genes linked to diseases remain symptom-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology students are typically taught that every cell in the body (except sperm and eggs) contains two copies of each gene—one inherited from each parent—and that both copies contribute equally to cellular function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this new study reveals that certain cells can exhibit a bias, selectively inactivating one parent’s copy of a gene. While this phenomenon was identified about a decade ago, the Columbia team has now demonstrated its potential impact on disease outcomes. By studying specific immune cells in typical individuals, the researchers found that these cells inactivated either the maternal or paternal gene copy in approximately 1 out of every 20 genes the cells use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is suggesting that there is more plasticity in our &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule composed of two long strands of nucleotides that coil around each other to form a double helix. It is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms that carries genetic instructions for development, functioning, growth, and reproduction. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; than we thought before,” says study leader Dusan Bogunovic, professor of pediatric immunology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So in some cells in your body, every 20th gene can be a little bit more Mom, a little bit less Dad, or vice versa. And to make things even more complicated, this can be different in white blood cells than in the kidney cells, and it can perhaps change with time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were published Jan. 1 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study explains a longstanding puzzle in medicine: why do some people who’ve inherited a disease-causing mutation experience fewer symptoms than others with the same mutation? “In many diseases, we’ll see that 90% of people who carry a mutation are sick, but 10% who carry the mutation don’t get sick at all,” says Bogunovic, a scientist who studies children with rare immunological disorders at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlisting an international team of collaborators, the researchers looked at several families with different genetic disorders affecting their immune systems. In each case, the disease-causing copy was more likely to be active in sick patients and suppressed in healthy relatives who had inherited the same genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was some speculation that this bias toward one copy or the other could explain wide differences in the severity of a genetic disease, but no experimental evidence existed until now,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the current work looked only at immune cells, Bogunovic says the selective bias for the maternal or paternal copy of a gene affected more than just immune-related genes. “We don’t see a preference for immune genes or any other class of genes, so we think this phenomenon can explain the wide variability in disease severity we see with many other genetic conditions,” he says, adding “this could be just the tip of the iceberg.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon could help explain diseases with flares, like lupus, or those that emerge following environmental triggers. It could also play a role in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Changing the future of treatments for genetic diseases?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings point to an entirely new paradigm for diagnosing and perhaps even treating inherited diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigators propose expanding the standard characterization of genetic diseases to include patients’ “transcriptotypes,” their gene activity patterns, in addition to their genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This changes the paradigm of testing beyond your DNA to your &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule similar to DNA that is essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. Both are nucleic acids, but unlike DNA, RNA is single-stranded. An RNA strand has a backbone made of alternating sugar (ribose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases—adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), or guanine (G). Different types of RNA exist in the cell: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;, which as we’ve shown in our study, is not equal in all cell types and can change over time,” says Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If researchers can identify the mechanisms behind selective gene inactivation, they may also be able to treat genetic diseases in a new way, by switching a patient’s gene expression pattern to suppress the undesirable copy. While emphasizing that such strategies are still far from clinical use, Bogunovic is optimistic: “At least in cell culture in the lab, we can do it, so manipulation in that way is something that could turn somebody’s genetic disease into non-disease, assuming we are successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

As of Dec. 23, University of Chicago Medicine is requiring all staff to wear masks in patient areas, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSF Healthcare, which includes Little Company of Mary Medical Center, 2800 W. 95th St. in Evergreen Park, is temporarily limiting hospital and hospice visitors to two adults per patient at a time, “with exceptions for special circumstances,” spokesperson Colleen Reynolds said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lin, an infectious disease physician and professor at Rush Medical Center, said the “deep upslope” in cases is typical for this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Respiratory viruses tend to spike in the winter months, primarily when people are gathering indoors, spending more time together and possibly spreading viruses,” Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines to protect people through the winter season are rolled out in the fall, but it’s not too late to get a flu shot or an updated COVID-19 booster if you haven’t already, Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV vaccines are recommended for adults 75 years and older and those 60-74 years old with increased risk, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html?s_cid=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_RSV-StayUpToDate-Brd:rsv%20vaccine%20schedule:SEM00093&amp;amp;utm_id=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_RSV-StayUpToDate-Brd:rsv%20vaccine%20schedule:SEM00093&amp;amp;gad_source=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. For infants — who face greater risk of severe RSV — there is a maternal vaccine given during pregnancy or an RSV antibody given to infants after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden rule: If you feel sick, stay home, Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going to events a little bit ill can cause a lot of spread,” Lin said. “If your child is sick, keep them away from other children. Do what’s practical.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lin recommends masking in crowded areas for people with underlying conditions that could make respiratory illnesses more severe. For others, masking is “really a personal preference after that,” Lin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At-home testing kits for respiratory illnesses are increasingly available, Lin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While COVID-19 is not as common as the flu and RSV at the moment, it’s unclear when those cases may spike, too, Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s becoming one of the common respiratory viruses, but it hasn’t settled into a pattern seasonally yet. It’s harder to predict when it’s going to strike,” said Lin, who noted there was a surge in COVID-19 last summer. “It’s not behaving yet like a classic respiratory virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is still unknown about the long-term effects of COVID-19, Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peak season for respiratory illnesses usually falls off by late April or early May, Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-primary-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-primary-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

thoroughly with water is the best line of defence against the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS already warn against relying on &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/1999801/mists-hospital-grade-best-hand-sanitisers/"&gt;hand sanitiser&lt;/a&gt; alone to stop the virus, as alcohol-based sanitisers don’t kill it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because it helps break down the protein shell of the virus, leaving it weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent the virus from spreading, experts also recommend washing and drying clothes in a high-heat setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Tetro, a microbiologist and author, told &lt;a aria-label="HuffPost (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/laundry-washing-clothes-sickness_l_676433a4e4b0e470145256a8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt; that clothing is like a “solid petri dish” because its porous fabric can trap the bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that comes into contact with your clothes is going to stick to [them]," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Norovirus [can] survive an entire month in pretty much any condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6126061203001" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="pV1KxHf2t" data-video-id-pending="6126061203001" data-brightcove-id="video_6126061203001_5067014667001-17327" id="video_6126061203001_5067014667001-17327" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Love Island's Ollie Williams reveals he and other contestants ‘had the s**ts’ in the villa and thinks there was a bug going around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic materials, such as polyester, hold onto the virus longer than natural ones, like cotton and wool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, Dr Jason explained, is because synthetic materials are made from petrochemicals, which are "very oily". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The microbes, which also are very oily on the outside … tend to stick around much longer…and they end up growing at a much faster rate," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/12154122/dad-dementia-washing-detergent-cornflakes-milk/" rel=""&gt;Washing detergents&lt;/a&gt; - specifically biological types - will help kill norovirus bacteria, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with hand washing hot water is your "best friend" when it comes to killing microbes, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended people also run an empty hot-water cycle with bleach once a month to clean the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;The 5 everyday mistakes putting you at greater risk of norovirus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;&lt;p class="article__content--intro"&gt;SUFFERING from headaches, vomiting or a high temperature?

Poor hand hygiene&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Failing to wash hands properly after using the bathroom or before handling food can spread norovirus, according to Dr Damien Tully, from the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Tully explains, "Norovirus is quite resilient—alcohol-based hand sanitisers won’t work as they can’t break through the virus's protective protein coat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The wrong cleaning products&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Using the wrong cleaning products can leave the virus behind, Dr Zina Alfahl, from the University of Galway, explains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Norovirus is resistant to many cleaning agents, so it's essential to use disinfectants with chlorine bleach to effectively neutralise it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Food prep errors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Preparing food while sick or shortly after recovery can contaminate meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating raw shellfish, like oysters, also increases the risk as they filter and accumulate the virus, making proper food washing essential, Dr Tully says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Poor sickness protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re ill, cleaning up properly is crucial, Dr Alfahl, added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scrub thoroughly and clean promptly" to prevent further contamination, she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Sharing towels, cutlery, and phones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing personal items such as towels, cutlery, or phones without proper sanitation can easily spread the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, "maintain good hygiene and avoid sharing these items," Dr Alfahl adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Minnesota stress that cleaning surfaces touched by someone infected with norovirus is essential to remove the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone vomits on furniture or carpet, they recommend not vacuuming right away, as this can spread pathogens into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, pour some baking soda on the area before using steam cleaning or antimicrobial products designed to fight norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) show that this year, 4,523 reports of norovirus have been recorded in the UK, more than double the 2,057 cases reported five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of patients with norovirus-like symptoms has been rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS data revealed that last week, 528 hospital beds in England were filled each day by patients suffering from diarrhoea, vomiting, or norovirus-like symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is down from 723 the previous week, it still represents a 40 per cent increase compared to last year’s 377 and 2022’s 338.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual case numbers could be even higher since the figures only account for confirmed cases and reported outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When to visit a doctor &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with norovirus will recover at home without needing to visit a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, generally go away on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS recommend rest, staying hydrated, and taking paracetamol for any fever or body aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rehydration drinks like &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/7536713/boots-norovirus-treatments-cases-soar/" rel=""&gt;Dioralyte&lt;/a&gt;, which replenishes both salts and fluids, can be bought over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should avoid giving children fizzy drinks or fruit juices, as these can make diarrhoea worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics don’t work for viral infections like norovirus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if someone is severely ill with intense vomiting and diarrhoea, they can ask their GP for anti-sickness medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The US Sun</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 12:55:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxONTZiVld5MzREVUtPbHc0aUVSZXdBTFNoZkFncWVyVmp1NzNlWXRJQXdWNnRac3F2d1JZb0p6U1BzcWtpSlNlUUphaU51WGRNa2FnWm9RcU5uRkgtOTFidGJiMk54eW1ZeWZwbmpVTElHMnAyVkgzTmZFR202S0xFRGcyLVFuaUVIMnFn0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9JVHE4dXFhMzJTc3VTYl85b1NYdDJmZUx6Mk9HQXpZcVZ0VFFtbGJWUXZBc1R2MXpoZE5SXzd2bkFCRm12Sm84TjVCUUw1Q3hqUXo0aU8wV0lOUlZZMWR0VWVaa3U4X25IYUZ4ZVVQN0RpLVF4MndPSl96ODZKWGZhWllIQjJPVTRhXzlsMHdIUg</guid></item><item><title>Norovirus can spread via clothes - as expert warns it can survive entire month in most conditions - The US Sun</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxONTZiVld5MzREVUtPbHc0aUVSZXdBTFNoZkFncWVyVmp1NzNlWXRJQXdWNnRac3F2d1JZb0p6U1BzcWtpSlNlUUphaU51WGRNa2FnWm9RcU5uRkgtOTFidGJiMk54eW1ZeWZwbmpVTElHMnAyVkgzTmZFR202S0xFRGcyLVFuaUVIMnFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOROVIRUS can linger on your clothes for up to a month, an expert has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fabric-lined items like chairs, pillows, and curtains can also hold onto the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/80861/norovirus-symptoms-how-long-last/" target="_blank" aria-label="norovirus (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;

thoroughly with water is the best line of defence against the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS already warn against relying on &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/1999801/mists-hospital-grade-best-hand-sanitisers/"&gt;hand sanitiser&lt;/a&gt; alone to stop the virus, as alcohol-based sanitisers don’t kill it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because it helps break down the protein shell of the virus, leaving it weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent the virus from spreading, experts also recommend washing and drying clothes in a high-heat setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Tetro, a microbiologist and author, told &lt;a aria-label="HuffPost (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/laundry-washing-clothes-sickness_l_676433a4e4b0e470145256a8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt; that clothing is like a “solid petri dish” because its porous fabric can trap the bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that comes into contact with your clothes is going to stick to [them]," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Norovirus [can] survive an entire month in pretty much any condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6126061203001" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="pV1KxHf2t" data-video-id-pending="6126061203001" data-brightcove-id="video_6126061203001_5067014667001-87533" id="video_6126061203001_5067014667001-87533" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Love Island's Ollie Williams reveals he and other contestants ‘had the s**ts’ in the villa and thinks there was a bug going around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic materials, such as polyester, hold onto the virus longer than natural ones, like cotton and wool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, Dr Jason explained, is because synthetic materials are made from petrochemicals, which are "very oily". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The microbes, which also are very oily on the outside … tend to stick around much longer…and they end up growing at a much faster rate," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/12154122/dad-dementia-washing-detergent-cornflakes-milk/" rel=""&gt;Washing detergents&lt;/a&gt; - specifically biological types - will help kill norovirus bacteria, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with hand washing hot water is your "best friend" when it comes to killing microbes, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended people also run an empty hot-water cycle with bleach once a month to clean the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;The 5 everyday mistakes putting you at greater risk of norovirus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;&lt;p class="article__content--intro"&gt;SUFFERING from headaches, vomiting or a high temperature?

Poor hand hygiene&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Failing to wash hands properly after using the bathroom or before handling food can spread norovirus, according to Dr Damien Tully, from the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Tully explains, "Norovirus is quite resilient—alcohol-based hand sanitisers won’t work as they can’t break through the virus's protective protein coat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves to watch hummingbirds—tiny, brightly colored blurs that dart about, hovering at flowers and pugnaciously defending their ownership of a feeder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to the scientists who study them, hummingbirds offer much more than an entertaining spectacle. Their small size and blazing metabolism mean they live life on a knife-edge, sometimes needing to shut down their bodies almost completely just to conserve enough energy to survive the night—or to migrate thousands of miles, at times across open ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their nectar-rich diet leads to blood sugar levels that would put a person in a coma. And their zipping, zooming flight sometimes generates g-forces high enough to make a fighter pilot black out. The more researchers look, the more surprises lurk within those tiny bodies, the smallest in the avian world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re the only bird in the world that can fly upside down and backwards,” says &lt;a href="http://www.wildlifegenetichealth.org/about-us/holly-ernest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Holly Ernest&lt;/a&gt;, a conservation ecologist with the University of Wyoming. “They drink pure sugar and don’t die of diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernest is one of a small number of researchers studying how hummingbirds cope with the extreme demands of their lifestyles. Here’s some of what scientists have learned about the unique adaptations of hummingbirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put in the work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, most researchers had assumed that hummingbirds spent only about 30% of their day engaged in the energy-intensive business of flitting from flower to flower and guzzling nectar, while resting most of the other time. But when physiological ecologist &lt;a href="https://anushashankar.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Anusha Shankar&lt;/a&gt; looked closely, she found they’re often working a lot harder than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shankar, now of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Hyderabad, India, tried to figure out how broad-billed hummingbirds in Southern Arizona spend their days. Using a mix of experimental methods, she measured the birds’ metabolic rate during various activities and estimated their total daily energy expenditure. Adding in previous published data, Shankar was able to calculate the per-minute energy cost of perching, flying, and hovering—basically a bird’s three options for spending time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then inferred how much time the birds must have spent feeding versus perching over the course of a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We ended up finding that it’s super variable,” Shankar says. During the early part of the summer when flowers are abundant, birds could meet their daily energy needs with as little as a few hours of feeding, spending as much as 70% of the day just perching, she found. But when flowers became scarcer after the arrival of the summer monsoon rains, birds at one site perched just 20% of the time and used the rest of the day for feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s 13 hours a day!” Shankar says. “There’s no way I can spend 13 hours a day running. I don’t know how they do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seriously chill&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hummingbirds have a trick to help them eke out their energy reserves. When a bird is in danger of running out of energy, it may go torpid at night, dropping its body temperature nearly to that of the surrounding air—sometimes just a few degrees above freezing. While in torpor, the bird appears almost comatose, unable to respond quickly to stimuli, and breathing only intermittently. The strategy can save up to 95% of hourly metabolic costs during cold nights, Shankar has calculated. That can be essential after days when a bird has fed less than usual, such as after a thunderstorm. It also helps birds save energy to pack on fat before migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shankar is now studying which parts of their physiology hummingbirds prioritize during torpor, by looking to see which gene products they can’t do without. “If you’re a hummingbird functioning at 10% of your normal metabolism, what is that 10% that’s keeping you alive?” she asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE PERFECT WAY TO WATCH THESE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="These Bird Feeders Have Onboard Cameras That Deliver Close-Ups and Live Streaming of Feathered Friends" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/these-bird-feeders-have-onboard-cameras-that-deliver-close-ups-of-your-feathered-friends/" rel="bookmark"&gt;These Bird Feeders Have Onboard Cameras That Deliver Close-Ups and Live Streaming of Feathered Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One set of genes that the birds seem to leave untouched are those responsible for their internal clock. “It’s important for them to do things at the right time when they’re in torpor,” Shankar says. To be ready to meet the day, for example, the birds begin to rouse from their torpor about an hour before sunrise, well before visible light cues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deal with the sugar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fuel their sky-high metabolic rate, hummingbirds suck down about 80% of their body weight in nectar each day. That’s the equivalent of a 150-pound person drinking nearly a hundred 20-ounce Cokes daily—and nectar is often much sweeter than a soda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human gut is incapable of absorbing sugar that fast, which is one reason why consuming too much soda or Halloween candy upsets the stomach, says &lt;a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/biosci/kenneth-welch" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ken Welch&lt;/a&gt;, a comparative physiologist at the University of Toronto at Scarborough. Hummingbirds cope with the onslaught by having leaky guts so that sugars can enter the bloodstream between gut cells instead of only through them. This gets sugar out of the gut quickly, before it can cause upset. That rapid transport, and probably other adaptations as well, allows hummingbirds to reach &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2021/what-does-mean-have-prediabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; as much as six times higher than those seen in people, Welch says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Rescued Crow Is Boy’s Best Friend, Waiting for Him to Get Home from School Every Day: ‘We’re his flock’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/rescued-crow-is-boys-best-friend-waiting-for-him-to-get-home-from-school-every-day-were-his-flock/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Rescued Crow Is Boy’s Best Friend, Waiting for Him to Get Home from School Every Day: ‘We’re his flock’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much sugar in the blood leads to serious physiological problems in people. It causes more sugar molecules to glom onto body proteins, a process known as glycation; in the long run, excess glycation causes many of the complications of diabetes, such as nerve damage. It’s still unclear how hummingbirds avoid the problems of glycation, Welch says, but clues are beginning to emerge. One study, for example, found that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-020-09964-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bird proteins contain fewer of the amino acids&lt;/a&gt; most prone to glycation than mammal proteins, and those that remain are often tucked deep within the protein where they’re less exposed to circulating sugars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other, as yet unknown strategies to cope with high blood sugar may one day yield practical benefits for managing diabetes in people. “There could be a gold mine in the genome of the hummingbird,” says Welch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do a metabolic flip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of its nightly fast, a hummingbird has nearly depleted its sugar stores—which poses an opposite metabolic challenge. “How does it wake up and fly?” Welch asks. “There’s nothing but fat available to burn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hummingbirds have evolved to be remarkably nimble at switching their metabolism from sugar-burning to fat-burning, he has found. “This requires an enormous shift in the biochemical pathways that are involved,” Welch says—and it happens in mere minutes, far more quickly than other organisms can manage. “If we could have that kind of control over our fuel use, we’d love that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE AMAZING BIRDS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Out-of-Place ‘Devil Bird’ Wows Spectators in Maine, the First Anhinga Ever Seen in the State" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/out-of-place-devil-bird-wows-spectators-in-maine-the-first-anhinga-ever-seen-in-the-state/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Out-of-Place ‘Devil Bird’ Wows Spectators in Maine, the First Anhinga Ever Seen in the State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar isn’t the only challenge posed by a nectar-rich diet. After all, nectar is mostly water—and birds that drink in so much liquid must get rid of most of it, without losing electrolytes. As a result, hummingbird kidneys are highly adapted to recapture electrolytes before they are excreted. “They pee almost distilled water,” says &lt;a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/people/martinezdelrio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Carlos Martinez del Rio&lt;/a&gt;, an ecophysiologist now retired from the University of Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that brings a further problem: If a hummingbird kept producing dilute urine overnight, it would die of dehydration before morning. To avoid that, &lt;a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/207/25/4383/15112/Hummingbirds-arrest-their-kidneys-at-night-diel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hummingbirds shut down their kidneys every night&lt;/a&gt;. “They go into what, in a human, would be considered acute renal failure,” says Martinez del Rio. “Hummingbirds have to do this, or they would [pee] themselves to death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fly higher—gradually&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metabolic demands on a hummingbird are tough enough at sea level. But many species live at high elevations, where thin air contains less oxygen and offers less resistance to push against when hovering. Consider the giant hummingbird, the world’s largest, which can live in the Andes Mountains at elevations over 14,000 feet—higher than many helicopters can fly. To cope with these conditions, the birds have evolved more hemoglobin-rich blood, says &lt;a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/jessie-williamson/"&gt;Jessie Williamson&lt;/a&gt;, an ornithologist at Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some of the birds face an even steeper challenge, as Williamson found. Giant hummingbirds are large enough that researchers can attach &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/physical-world/2019/gps-going-places" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;satellite tracking tags&lt;/a&gt;, as well as smaller geolocators. So Williamson and her colleagues decided to fit the birds with trackers. After thousands of hours spent trying to capture birds with netting, the researchers managed to attach trackers to 57 birds using custom-made harnesses of elastic jewelry cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER OUTRAGEOUS ETHNOLOGIES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Mountain Chickadees have Remarkable Memories–with Ability to Recall Locations of 10,000 Hidden Snacks" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mountain-chickadees-have-remarkable-memories-with-ability-to-recall-locations-of-10000-hidden-snacks/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Mountain Chickadees have Remarkable Memories–with Ability to Recall Locations of 10,000 Hidden Snacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though they recovered tracking data from only eight birds, even that tiny sample had a big surprise: Some of the birds lived in the high Andes year-round, while others—which turned out to be a separate, hitherto unrecognized species—&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313599121"&gt;migrate to the Andes annually &lt;/a&gt;from breeding grounds along the coast of Chile. That means they face not only the obvious &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2020/earth-birds-take-next-left"&gt;challenges of a long migration&lt;/a&gt;—a round trip of roughly 5,000 miles—but also the need to adapt to thinner air as they travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their secret? Do it gradually. “It looks a lot like how human mountaineers summit something like Mount Everest, with bursts of climbing and pauses to acclimatize,” Williamson says. “The journey takes months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tracking technology becomes lighter and cheaper, researchers like Williamson hope to follow smaller hummingbird species as well. That, together with other progress in research technology, may offer plenty of new surprises about the biology of these tiny, amazing birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re following—or considering—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, you may wonder if you’re getting enough protein. After all, this heart-healthy eating plan is based on a foundation of plant foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A Greek yogurt parfait isn’t just a rich, creamy source of high-quality protein. It’s also incredibly versatile. While our Ricotta &amp;amp; Yogurt Parfait is one spin, there are endless variations. You can add nuts, seeds, granola, fruit or even veggies to tweak it to your liking. In the process, you’ll score vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and more!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Greek yogurt is a fantastic snack choice because it’s high in protein, which helps keep you full and satisfied, aiding in weight management and muscle repair,” says &lt;a href="https://kayteehadley.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaytee Hadley, M.S., RDN, IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in functional medicine and gut health. And this Mediterranean staple isn’t packed with just any kind of protein. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Dairy foods&lt;/a&gt;, like yogurt, contain an extremely high-quality form of protein that our bodies use super efficiently. When you’re eating a diet consisting mainly of plants, that can have some decided advantages!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, one study found that people who regularly consumed yogurt had less &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the deep, stubborn belly fat that’s been linked to heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. They also had healthier diets overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If gaining muscle is a goal, you can’t do better than snacking on Greek yogurt after a workout. Just one 5.6-ounce container provides 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One small study found that when eaten three times daily in combination with a resistance-training program, Greek yogurt helped improve strength, muscle thickness and body composition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Greek yogurt does more than just deliver protein. “It’s also a great source of calcium for strong bones and contains beneficial probiotics for a healthy gut,” says Hadley.  Studies have found a greater abundance of beneficial bacteria in the guts of people who routinely consume yogurt, which can help regulate gut inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not sure if you should go with full-fat, low-fat or fat-free? While you may have heard that you should prioritize nonfat or low-fat dairy to minimize saturated fat, research doesn’t necessarily agree. In fact, studies have found that full-fat yogurt (and cheese!) may protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, don’t get too worried about whether your favorite is fat-free, low-fat or full-fat. Whichever you like best will do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, a yogurt parfait isn’t just about the yogurt. “Topping plain Greek yogurt with nutrient-rich, colorful foods is a great way to boost its benefits,” says Hadley. Berries can add antioxidants and fiber, while nuts and seeds provide healthy fats and extra protein, she says. “A touch of honey or maple syrup can add a natural sweetness, and spices like cinnamon add warmth and flavor,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While Greek yogurt is a great way to squeeze protein into a Mediterranean eating plan, it’s not the only way. When you need a protein-rich Mediterranean snack, this cheat sheet can help.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you’ll eat plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913519/what-are-legumes-are-they-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt; on the Med diet. But you’ll also enjoy smaller portions of other lean proteins like fish, nuts, seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy, chicken and turkey. The beauty of these is that they’re low in saturated fat, so they support heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Once you’ve picked your protein, enhance your snack by adding another food group or two. If you’re going with a Greek yogurt parfait, this could mean adding fruit, granola, nuts or seeds. But parfaits aren’t the only way to make Greek yogurt shine. It’s also a home run in dips like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267210/tahini-yogurt-dip/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tahini-Yogurt Dip&lt;/a&gt; or our creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250924/avocado-yogurt-dip/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Avocado-Yogurt Dip&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As fantastic as Greek yogurt is, don’t be afraid to switch things up! Mixed nuts with dried fruit, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248712/homemade-trail-mix/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;homemade trail mix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;classic hummus&lt;/a&gt; with veggies or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250108/black-bean-quesadillas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;black bean quesadilla&lt;/a&gt; are all wins. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that animal proteins like fish, chicken, turkey, eggs and dairy tend to be higher in protein than plant sources like nuts or legumes. If loading up on protein is your priority, you may want to opt for a lean animal protein or pair multiple plant sources together. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Keep an Eye on Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet isn’t just low in saturated fat and rich in fiber and nutrients. It also limits added sugars. When possible, stick with a brand of yogurt that contains few, if any, added sugars. Choosing plain Greek is ideal. But if you’re not a fan of plain yogurt’s tang, look for brands with minimal added sugar. There are even flavored varieties with zero added sugar. To find out for sure, check out the Nutrition Facts panel.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is about more than just what you eat. It’s also about how you eat and the other health-promoting behaviors you practice. For example, the Mediterranean lifestyle tends to be slower-paced than ours. That may be part of the reason research has linked the Mediterranean diet and mindful eating to better psychological resilience and overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you can, try to slow down and eat your snack mindfully. We know this isn’t always possible, but even just taking five minutes to be present with your food is worthwhile. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the Mediterranean diet centers around plant foods, there are plenty of high-protein foods that fit into this eating pattern. And one of our favorites is Greek yogurt. So next time you need a healthy, high-protein snack, whip up a Greek yogurt parfait like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255766/ricotta-yogurt-parfait/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ricotta &amp;amp; Yogurt Parfait&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to protein, you’ll also score calcium and probiotics. But don’t stop there. There are countless ways to create a delicious Greek yogurt parfait in minutes. Whether you top yours with granola, fruit, nuts or seeds—or all of these—you’ll score vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Now, that’s what we call a recipe for health!&lt;br&gt;

Melissa Hurtado (D-Sanger) has been frustrated by what she says are gaps in tracking the bird flu’s spread in the Central Valley, where many of the state’s most vulnerable people — dairy and poultry workers — live and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re tracking disease that spreads from animal to human, you want to be looking at rural areas, like the county of Tulare where there are more cows than there are people — yet there’s no testing of wastewater anywhere south of Fresno in the valley,” Hurtado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 30, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;37 people in California have tested positive for H5N1&lt;/a&gt;; all but one was a dairy worker. In addition, more than two-thirds of the state’s dairy herds — 697 — have been infected, as well as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;93 commercial or backyard poultry flocks,&lt;/a&gt; accounting for nearly 22 million birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 18, Gov. Gavin Newsom &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-18/newsom-declares-emergency-in-california-after-cdc-confirms-severe-bird-flu-case-in-louisiana"&gt;declared a state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; after the virus jumped from the state’s Central Valley dairy herds into Southern California dairy cattle, despite quarantine restrictions designed to stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus, which is also moving in migrating birds and wildlife populations, has been detected in wastewater sites around the state, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-01/h5-virus-found-in-la-county-wastewater"&gt;including in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-04/bird-markets-may-be-source-of-h5-in-san-francisco-wastewater"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and San Jose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sampling is sparse in the Central Valley, where the majority of human cases have been reported and the risk is high. Indeed, wastewater sampling for bird flu is nonexistent in some of the counties most at risk, including Tulare and Kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-current-testing-is-not-good-enough" class="subhead"&gt;Why current testing is not good enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling wastewater helps public health officials track a virus’ spread. It has been a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-21/sewage-surveillance-covid-infectious-diseases-future"&gt;tactic officials employed during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in order to monitor the coronavirus spread. In California, officials used wastewater to predict waves of infection and just how much the virus was circulating among populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, health officials say they are monitoring 78 sites in 36 counties for a range of viruses; in all but two sites they say they are looking for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email to The Times, state officials said the state’s Cal-SuWers Network is monitoring six sites in the Central Valley, including in Kern, Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent sample from Kern County was submitted Dec. 7, and it was positive for the virus. &lt;a class="link" href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a major blind spot in the state’s surveillance system, state officials acknowledge, yet note it’s one they have little control over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Availability of wastewater monitoring at a site … requires utility participation, which is voluntary,” said Ali Bay, spokeswoman for the state agency. “Competing priorities and resource constraints can reduce a [utility’s] capacity to participate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tulare County and Kings County lead the state with the most human cases, according to the numbers each county has released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Flores, a spokesperson for the Tulare County public health department, said the county’s independent wastewater treatment plants have chosen not to participate in the state’s surveillance program. Tulare has 18 reported cases, the most of any county and nearly half the state’s total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everardo Legaspi, deputy director for Kings County public health department, told The Times they have had four confirmed cases.  The county has been unable to participate in the state’s wastewater surveillance project since October because of staffing shortages, he added, but the county is working to begin wastewater collection and expand it to other sites in the county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months, &lt;a class="link" href="https://features.csis.org/US-bird-flu-response/" target="_blank"&gt;experts have been concerned&lt;/a&gt; that public health authorities have been lethargic in their response to the burgeoning pandemic, and that public safety has taken a back seat to agricultural interests. It was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-06/usda-says-it-will-start-testing-milk-for-h5n1-nationwide"&gt;only last month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture began a program to test for the virus&lt;/a&gt; in the nation’s raw milk supply — roughly a year after experts believe the virus spilled into cattle, and after more than 900 dairy herds and 60 people were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think that people are continually minimizing this outbreak and this virus,” said Rick Bright, a virologist and the former head of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. “Our government officials are not doing the thorough investigation they should be doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the USDA’s announcement about the new bulk milk testing program, only 13 states are being included in the initial rollout; many, including California, Colorado and Michigan, were already testing their milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-transition-team-plans-immediate-who-withdrawal-expert-says-2024-12-23/" target="_blank"&gt;the incoming Trump administration has threatened to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, a move that would further blind the U.S. and the rest of the world to the virus’ movements. Although the Biden administration announced Thursday that it was committing an additional $306 million to ward off a potential outbreak of bird flu in humans — funds that would be distributed before he leaves office later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that the right questions are being asked to have an understanding of this bird flu,” Hurtado said. “In large part it’s because there’s just a lack of guidance coming from the feds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-we-could-learn-from-bird-flu-surveillance-if-we-were-doing-it-right" class="subhead"&gt;What we could learn from bird flu surveillance if we were doing it right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, finding bird flu in wastewater does not mean there is a human outbreak of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike COVID-19, mpox or seasonal influenza — which when found in wastewater indicate human infections — positive samples of bird flu could be from a variety of sources, including pasteurized milk. That’s because the method used to sample for bird flu in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-16/texas-researchers-identify-bird-flu-in-wastewater-of-nine-cities-filling-in-cdc-data-gaps"&gt;wastewater looks for markers of the virus, not the whole virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the tests could be picking up inactivated fragments of the virus, like those found in commercial pasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we really know what it means,” said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. ”How much milk gets poured down the drain in an urban area? We know we can get high… loads in supermarket milk. I actually have no clue what supermarkets do with expired milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-06-29/signs-of-avian-flu-found-in-san-francisco-wastewater"&gt;it’s coming from raw milk or raw meat. Or even waste products from wild birds and mammals&lt;/a&gt;, in which the virus is also currently circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the outbreak, California officials have found the virus &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds" target="_blank"&gt;in wild birds such as rock pigeons, white-faced ibis, and turkey vultures&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;wild mammals including mountain lions, raccoons and skunks.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it’s possible people are shedding inactivated virus in their feces, said Alexandra Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and principal investigator and program director for WastewaterSCAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-fight-to-improve-the-system" class="subhead"&gt;The fight to improve the system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of what the samples are showing, they provide evidence that the virus is circulating somewhere in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the fact that health and water utility officials in certain regions of the state are willfully not looking for it is another example of the government’s failure to contain the disease and keep track of its spread, said Bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus is evolving quickly. … Without full participation in surveillance and testing programs, coupled with full and timely transparency, we will always be behind the virus,” said Bright. “Our ability to get in front of it will be hampered without full collaboration and cooperation at federal, state, local and community levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Hurtado, the situation is also personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said her father and her niece, who live in the Central Valley, displayed bird flu symptoms earlier this year, but no testing was available to confirm her suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father contracted a virus that nearly killed him and involved severe muscle and body aches, a symptom of bird flu. Her 7-year-old niece, who lives in Sanger, a town with a large poultry processing plant, recently had a rare autoimmune response to a virus, and she had red, swollen eyes, a symptom of the H5N1 virus. Her doctors don’t know what triggered the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite showing symptoms, she said, neither was tested for bird flu — but she suspects they had it. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-11-26/bird-flu-warnings-are-going-unheeded-at-many-dairy-farms"&gt;Dairy farmers, workers and family members have also told The Times&lt;/a&gt; that they believe the state’s reported numbers are likely an undercount, as some workers may not report being sick for fear of losing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have the science or the information to back it up, but my heart tells me both my father and my niece got the bird flu,” she said. “Both were impacted by severe illness by some unknown virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal experience has driven her to push the state for answers on tracking the virus’ spread. She has asked the state’s health department about the lack of Central Valley testing but she said she hasn’t gotten a clear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurtado has also pushed for an increase in testing in high-risk communities. Despite some testing for individuals at risk, including dairy and poultry workers, the state doesn’t offer a comprehensive way to test heavily agricultural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurtado, whose district includes a large swath of the Central Valley, said she intends to propose legislation that would expand the state’s wastewater surveillance program to include sites in underserved and high-risk communities in rural areas. The legislation would also develop criteria for identifying high-priority sites based on health risks, population density and socioeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurtado worries about communities like Sanger, her hometown. There is a poultry processing plant, one of the largest employers in the city and county, that has been hit hard by bird flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the end of October, a dozen commercial poultry operations in Fresno County &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;have been hit by the virus&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the culling of more than 1.5 million birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has heard stories of workers losing hours of work as animals have gotten sick and poultry farms have been entirely depopulated. The price of eggs also has risen as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we could’ve done a lot more a lot earlier,” she said. “But we’re here, and we’ve got to be able to improve upon where we’ve failed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 11:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNdGxMdEx3RFNvMVpETlZMdTNDaDRKQUJVcGNMMHJYeWhVZEN0cE4xU0w5b1hxN1l2ZVJRa0w4V1VneTh0cXZCM2IwaUc2WnRyTDczRVBNOEpOX3FzU3RiTkpoZmFLeGV6dGlBNXhoX1VUYlBqU3N0WnVqR3N6QTRydGtXekc5bGYxZmcxaU44VDlDSVZsc0FJSjZGbklKM1FmTFlQS2hrZ29TUQ</guid></item><item><title>Arkansas Department of Health weekly respiratory disease report December 28 - ktlo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQZHlQS3dqQ1UxOHNzMUpReWtQUTBFSm5lVFJyOG9UY2ZqQkszNkhKeFpKdmZQam1XYmVRUk5mUC0xeDhjb3hYLUp1NEx4TXRKZ3ZEbnk2WmpYTk5Pak5MZ0pYVFBxcllmRXhjWEtxN3lzZTVjaHFmcTA1LUpiSXVTSHlqR012NjR2SG1fc3hLTXdVbVRYOGFxT1BMSklPajJRLXZocE1qWHRxdTh2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-935778" class="post-935778 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-localnews category-wireready with-thumbnail"&gt;

The Arkansas Department of Health’s (ADH) weekly respiratory disease report released Friday shows the intensity level has risen into the very high category. The scale has three levels of very high, three levels of high, two levels of moderate, two levels of low and three levels of minimal. This week’s level is the lowest of the very high level. Last week the level was at the highest level of the high category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wire-ready-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the week ending this past Saturday, Dec. 28, the ADH reported 34 new flu-related hospitalizations in Arkansas and 50 new COVID-19 hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new deaths were attributed to the flu last week and seven flu deaths have been reported since Sept. 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 35 deaths reported the past week by the ADH due to pneumonia in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No new COVID-19 deaths were reported this past week. The total number of deaths in 2024 in Arkansas due to COVID was 484.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four influenza outbreaks have been reported at nursing homes or other congregate setting institutions so far this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also provides the percentage of students absent in each county for the week, but that report is not available due to the Christmas break for schools.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Those who grew up when &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/10/26/goodbye-dare-more-schools-are-embracing-realistic-drug-education_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.)&lt;/a&gt; pamphlets were common in the school counselor's office are probably familiar with the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/11/18/citing-debunked-gateway-drug-myth-joe-biden-comes-out-against-legalizing-marijuana/" target="_blank"&gt;“gateway drug” theory,&lt;/a&gt; which suggests the use of one substance like cannabis or alcohol will send a person down the path to try “harder” drugs like cocaine or meth later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gateway drug theory and many other ideas about drug use have been put into question in recent years as more resources are dedicated to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/substance_use" target="_blank"&gt;substance use&lt;/a&gt;, which has been highly stigmatized for decades. After initially labeling cannabis as a gateway drug in 2010, President Joe Biden even later &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/joe-biden-walks-back-marijuana-gateway-drug-comment-after-week-of-criticism/"&gt;walked back his stance&lt;/a&gt;, saying in 2019: “I don’t think it is a gateway drug. There’s no evidence I’ve seen to suggest that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of substance use disorder are &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/genetics-of-substance-use-disorders-a-review/B3BAE9D2DCF78C7C4833A8DB4420F5B2" target="_blank"&gt;complex and not fully understood&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the hallmarks of addiction is understood to be caused by repeated drug use that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37446084/#:~:text=The%20progressive%20nature%20of%20addiction,(3)%20preoccupation%2Fanticipation."&gt;neurologically changes the brain&lt;/a&gt;. Because the use of one substance like alcohol or nicotine is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743518301658"&gt;associated with the use of other drugs like cannabis&lt;/a&gt;, many have drawn causal links between the use of various drugs in theories like the gateway drug hypothesis. However, this idea has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/26/is-marijuana-a-gateway-drug"&gt;highly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and as the understanding of substance use has improved, scientists began to understand that people may have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3600369/#:~:text=In%20contrast%20to%20the%20GH,and%20changes%20in%20the%20risk."&gt;“common liability”&lt;/a&gt; to substances in general and that drug use is influenced by a host of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our behavior is determined basically by our brain and our experience, and our experience can affect our brain as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828520"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published late December analyzed brain scans of adolescents before and after they first tried alcohol, nicotine or cannabis, shedding light on one factor that could be influencing whether people decide to start using drugs. Writing in JAMA Network Open, Dr. Alex Miller, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Indiana University School of Medicine, and his team found that adolescents who initiated substance use had differences in certain brain structures compared to kids who didn’t use drugs. Importantly, most differences existed before they started using alcohol, nicotine or cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study sort of helps us highlight which regions may be important to further explore, with respect to their association as pre-existing risk factors for substance use initiation,” Miller told Salon in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural brain differences have been previously found in people who use drugs and were assumed to be effects of drug use, said Dr. Jonathan Foulds, a professor of public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine who was not involved in the study. This study shows certain differences were there among adolescents who used substances prior to use, meaning they could not have been caused by the substance use, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our behavior is determined basically by our brain and our experience, and our experience can affect our brain as well,” Foulds told Salon in a phone interview. This study "casts doubt on some of the prior gateway theories because it seems like many of the same brain differences that are a risk factor for nicotine use are also a risk factor for alcohol and cannabis use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences observed in the study were small but statistically significant within a large sample size close to 10,000 participants, Miller said. Specifically, those who initiated these substances before age 15 had larger overall brains and a thinner prefrontal cortex in certain regions compared to kids who didn’t initiate drug use. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for things like decision making and information processing, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2991430/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; research has &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/10/2471" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that a thinner prefrontal cortex is associated with more impulsive behavior and risky decision making, which could be linked to kids initiating substance use, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some of the measures observed in this study went in the opposite direction to what is observed in brain scans of people who have substance use disorder. For example, heavy drug use has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1395124"&gt;smaller overall brain sizes&lt;/a&gt;, and heavy cannabis consumption has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14047-heavy-cannabis-use-linked-to-smaller-brain-parts/"&gt;smaller hippocampal volumes&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, substance use was linked to larger overall brain sizes and larger hippocampal volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this doesn’t mean that children with these differences in anatomy will inevitably go on to try drugs, said Dr. Bertha Madras, a psychobiology professor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved with the study either. There are dozens of risk factors that influence whether kids use drugs, including genetics, accessibility to substances, and the prenatal environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that some other factor is influencing the anatomical differences and drug use, like a predisposition to risky behaviors or teens’ perception of how harmful substance use is, Madras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Integrating the whole picture would give us a much better view of what the risk factors for using drugs are and what the risk factors that are consequent to drug use are,” Madras told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis uses data from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6375310/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20objectives%20of,substance%20use%20and%20its%20consequences"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed to follow a large group of children over many years to help determine the neurological origins and consequences of substance use. Miller said he plans to use the data to try and tease out what is behind these brain differences and whether they are due to genetics or potential environmental risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245190222400301X"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the ABCD dataset found that certain brain activity in childhood could predict substance use initiation and that this was associated with children’s exposure to pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the complex interplay between the factors that contribute and that protect against drug use is crucial for informing effective prevention interventions and providing support for those who may be most vulnerable,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in a &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/12/brain-structure-differences-are-associated-with-early-use-of-substances-among-adolescents"&gt;press release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Results were decidedly mixed: Nine patients reported some improvement, but only five said it lasted. Four reported no improvement at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Perhaps more than anything, the report underscores that nearly five years after the pandemic began, there is still little known about what can help the millions of people with long Covid. While some people improve on their own or with various therapies and medications, no treatment has yet been shown to be widely successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“People with long Covid are eager for treatments that can help,” said Alison Cohen, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is an author of the new report and has long Covid herself. “There’s been a lot of research, but it continues to be slow going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Paxlovid, made by Pfizer, is considered a tantalizing prospect because it can prevent severe illness during active Covid infections and because patients who take the five-day course during the infection have been &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/health/paxlovid-long-covid.html" title=""&gt;less likely to develop long Covid later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In addition, a theory that some long Covid cases may be caused by &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nih.gov/many-people-long-covid-have-signs-persistent-sars-cov-2-proteins-new-findings-show" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;remnants of virus in the body&lt;/a&gt; suggests that an antiviral like Paxlovid might vanquish those symptoms by extinguishing lingering virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171d1bw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_exemptions_for_nonmedical_reasons"&gt;Exemptions for nonmedical reasons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, medical exemptions for required vaccinations have stayed relatively the same. These are exemptions that have been confirmed by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonmedical exemptions — which anyone can seek on religious, moral, ethical or philosophical grounds — have been on a steady increase with a noticeable spike in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these exemptions have gone up a few percentage points with the MMR vaccines seeing the most exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="customHtml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_why_are_there_more_nonmedical_exemptions%3F"&gt;Why are there more nonmedical exemptions?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to nonmedical exemptions, there are people who like to make their own decisions and people who are afraid of vaccines, said Dr. Jill Foster, professor of pediatrics at University of Minnesota Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That second group, she said, may have many reasons for their fears, including fear of needles, safety concerns or a belief in misinformation they’ve seen online. Whatever the reason, it can be problematic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really is a slippery slope, once you start going to exemptions that aren’t fact based and not evidence based,” Foster said. “And that’s kind of what's happened. People either just say, ‘Well, I personally don’t believe in vaccines,’ or they say, ‘I have a religious reason to not have vaccines,’ which there are no organized religions that actually are against vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exemption laws can vary from state to state. Forty-seven allow religious exemptions and 18 allow philosophical exemptions. Minnesota allows both. These exemptions also do not need to be renewed unless a school district requires a new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health collects information exemptions and shares this data with school districts, so schools can better know how protected their students are from vaccine preventable diseases. The exemptions themselves are handled at the district level. MDH said districts approve the vast majority of exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s_very_worrisome%E2%80%99"&gt;‘It’s very worrisome’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, exemptions are around the 3 percent mark and around 90 percent of school aged children are vaccinated. Experts, though, say the current situation is still concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very worrisome, because a choice not to vaccinate is not a risk free choice,” said Tabitha Hanson, a registered nurse and consultant with the state Health Department. “So a parent might think that if they don’t vaccinate, they’re eliminating risk by not getting the vaccination. However, by not vaccinating, that’s a choice to take a different and more serious risk, and we’re seeing the results of that risk when we have outbreaks of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanson said it’s not always because of vaccine skepticism that people file nonmedical exemptions for. It can also be a lack of access to vaccines and a lack of convenience in scheduling appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hanson and other experts, building trust with medical providers is the most helpful in making families feel better about immunizations. It’s important for parents to feel safe asking questions to their medical provider without feeling judgment so they can make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOVEk1RmgyWlpDb1NkdHNRY0RCc0kwcW5xNnE2SVMwcWFLODlwVXoyNWtpbmNEUzNGTW1LNjRZMG5wWlB6WjlhSzM3TkVuSWdXSXllMmtZVzlYR2Q2ZVhtZ0NxbDdVaUFnUVQxS2pBeE1VTHA0QUh6ZEljeUJJQl9mZ1F3Y2RGRWRYX0pJNTdmUDlZUHlPRjNROTNGdXRlZFlHUElpX0lmdkZtSklPY2VIbHhn</guid></item><item><title>Canadian teen with bird flu was on life support, new report reveals - Salon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPZl91SjY5Y0pvTTlfVGJwbHRKbkVXSFNfeWpTOEc3WDdHQk8yc3d6M3Y5NEtxYmNfejdmNHlPZWV0WXJVTzFSeGpPRFVJYzhGdzc5eHgzZW1iWW8yV1JtOTl2Qi1MY3NRdWdSV1JhUms0X1hpa2hXZnVfdzhFT0oxR29tQnpLUlYtMW9KRm45SFhYZ3R1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;
								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/01/06/new-report-on-severe-case-of-canadian-teen-with-bird-flu/"&gt;
																
								&lt;p&gt;In November, a teenager in British Columbia was infected and hospitalized with &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/bird_flu" target="_blank"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, caused by the H5N1 virus. While &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/12/18/bird-flu-hospitalizes-person-in-louisiana-the-first-severe-infection-in-us/" target="_blank"&gt;most cases have been mild&lt;/a&gt;, commonly characterized by conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms, this previously healthy Canadian teen was &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q2529.full" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalized from the virus in critical condition&lt;/a&gt;. Their symptoms started with double conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, and turned into a fever and coughing. A few days later the teenager was admitted to intensive care after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a healthy teenager prior to this, so no underlying conditions,” said British Columbia’s health officer, Bonnie Henry, at a news conference at the time. “It just reminds us that in young people this is a virus that can progress and cause quite severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a recent report brings to light more details about the teenager’s case. In the report, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)&lt;/a&gt;, researchers explain that the 13-year-old girl spent weeks fighting for her life after contracting a severe H5N1 infection from an unknown source. In finding her diagnosis, researchers say that she initially tested positive for influenza A, but not the seasonal subtype. Further testing suggested she had a high viral load of a novel influenza A infection, which researchers discovered to be the H5N1 avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day doctors started her on oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu. However, her respiratory functions declined rapidly causing her to be intubated. She was also placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a machine that is a form of life support for people with life-threatening illnesses. In addition to the ECMO machine, the teenager received a plasma exchange and two more antiviral medication treatments — amantadine and baloxavir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2416323"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, experts noted while mutations were detected in her case, it’s “unclear whether these mutations were present in the infecting virus or emerged during the course of the patient’s illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s unclear if the virus mutated to be more severe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mutations evident in the Canadian case highlight the urgent need for vigilant surveillance of emerging mutations and assessment of the threat of human-to-human transmission,” the editorial stated, adding that vaccine development and therapeutics are also needed — perhaps to treat more severe illness. “The Canadian case showed higher viral loads in the lower airway and very prolonged shedding, despite therapy, which highlights the potential need for longer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded their editorial with an acknowledgment that “many questions remain.” For example, the severity of cases is likely to depend on host immunity, the route of exposure, or other changes in the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the CDC says that the risk to most Americans remains low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do have candidate vaccines and antivirals available to try to mitigate severe influenza in the case of wider spread,” the report stated. “That said, a balance between enhanced vigilance and ‘business as usual’ is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Five years ago this week, STAT was interviewing nervous infectious disease scientists about a mysterious disease spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, located roughly 500 miles west of Shanghai. On &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/"&gt;Jan. 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, we published the first of what would become a torrent of articles on the disease now known as Covid-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The intervening years have both sped and crawled by, too busy at times to take stock of all that has changed, too plodding to believe we have arrived at this anniversary already. (The first case of Covid in the U.S., in a person who had traveled to Wuhan, was not confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jan. 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What do we have to show for the time that has passed? Not enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying &lt;a href="https://freakonomics.com/2009/08/quotes-uncovered-who-said-no-crisis-should-go-to-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;attributed to all sorts of people&lt;/a&gt; that one shouldn’t waste a good crisis. In public health, especially, learning from disease outbreaks and environmental disasters is critical; figuring out what worked and what didn’t is fundamental to emergency response planning for the next time. Much as we all might hate the idea, the fact remains that there will be more pandemics. We cannot wish them away and we imperil ourselves if we do not prepare for them. Already, there are renewed concerns about the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/26/global-health-three-issues-to-watch/"&gt;potential for an H5N1 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with the virus tearing through U.S. dairy cow herds over the past year and also infecting at least 66 people in this country, most of them workers exposed to infected cows or poultry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet there haven’t been the types of post-mortems or after-action inquiries that normally follow an event of the magnitude of the Covid pandemic. In 2021 a group of experts in public health, science, and other fields began to lay the groundwork for what they thought would be an independent commission looking into the handling of Covid. When the Biden administration decided not to appoint such a body, the group turned its work into &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/24/chronicling-failures-us-covid-response/"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; that was published in the spring of 2023. “They didn’t have an agenda in mind. They could not articulate even to themselves internally as to how the system should change,” the lead author, Phillip Zelikow, said at the time of the administration’s decision to forgo an inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We appear to be trying to teach ourselves the lessons of Covid the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;



		
		
&lt;p&gt;So as we ruminate on the fact that a half-decade has passed since Covid entered our world, here are some thoughts about things we will likely have to deal with when the next pandemic hits — realities that can be traced back directly to the Covid experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="h-public-trust-in-public-health-institutions-has-cratered" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Public trust in public health institutions has cratered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC has long been the world’s preeminent public health agency. It’s not a coincidence the Chinese, European, and African equivalents are called China CDC, the ECDC, and the Africa CDC. But at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when the United States was trying to identify newly infected individuals to limit transmission, a test devised by the CDC — the only one in use at the time — failed. Mistakes happen, but that was a bad mistake to make at a very bad time to make it. A successful test would not have stopped Covid. But the unsuccessful test made the CDC look inept just when the country turned to it to chart the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, messaging from officials at the CDC and elsewhere in the government discouraged the public from wearing masks, in part — though this was not generally acknowledged out loud — to preserve scarce supplies for health care workers who were forced to reuse disposable surgical masks for days on end because hospitals couldn’t replace them. Then the guidance shifted and people were urged to mask up even out of doors, with the CDC’s website offering instructions on how to make a mask using hair elastics and T-shirt fabric. A surreal read even back in 2020, those instructions can still be found &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/97837" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the agency’s online archives&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there were communications failures that further undermined the CDC’s reputation in some quarters. The agency’s guidance on how long people with Covid &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;needed to isolate themselves&lt;/a&gt; was shortened when the highly infectious Omicron variant took off in late 2021. The move wasn’t evidence-based; it was motivated by real-world exigencies. So many people were becoming sick at once that in order to keep pharmacies and health care operations functioning, the 10-day isolation recommendation had to be eased. It made sense, at least for essential workers. But the exact reason for the move was never fully explained, and a public that had grown skeptical of the CDC’s competence viewed it as either yet another flip-flop, or a mistake, or both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What the public forgets — never really seemed to take onboard, actually — was that Covid was a new disease, which meant that scientists at the CDC and the World Health Organization (which also took some credibility blows) and elsewhere were figuring things out in real time — like how the virus transmitted, when people were infectious, how long it took from infection to symptom onset as the SARS-CoV-2 virus was spreading around the globe. People in the emergency response sector talk about building the ship and sailing it at the same time. That was Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of welcoming course corrections as the logical extension of the acquisition of more information, the public viewed them as evidence of earlier errors. The legacy of those perceived mistakes will follow agencies like the CDC and the WHO into the next pandemic, especially if the next one occurs when memories of Covid are still fresh. &lt;/p&gt;



		
		
&lt;p&gt;It is also, incidentally, hurting those agencies now. The incoming Trump administration is talking about &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/23/dave-weldon-cdc-marty-makary-fda-trump-rfk-jr/"&gt;major changes at the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6061ed5-2703-4b8a-9948-a557aaaf52c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. withdrawal from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;. If either agency had emerged from the Covid pandemic as bona fide heroes in the eyes of the public, such moves might be seen as too risky to make. Such is not the case. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="h-the-way-to-rapid-vaccine-development-is-mrna-but-people-don-t-trust-it" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The way to rapid vaccine development is mRNA. But people don’t trust it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT has said it before and we’ll say it again: The speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed, tested, authorized, and distributed en masse around the globe was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/14/why-covid-19-vaccines-are-a-freaking-miracle/"&gt;a freaking miracle&lt;/a&gt;. That it happened with the speed it did — first doses of the first vaccines were in arms within 11 months, 11 billion doses were distributed globally in the 15 months that followed — was in large measure due to the success of the messenger RNA vaccine platform, the production method used by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech as well as by Moderna. They were the first vaccines to become available and they retain the largest portion of market share in affluent countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key feature of the mRNA vaccine platform is that it is flexible and fast. Whereas the strains that go into flu shots have to be selected in February so that vaccine manufacturers have enough time to make the needed doses for the fall, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/updated-covid-19-vaccines-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced in mid-June&lt;/a&gt; what strain the fall 2024 Covid vaccines should target, and initial doses of the two mRNA products were made and approved for release on Aug. 22. Novavax, which uses a different and slower production process, had started making its fall shots “at risk” before the mid-June strain guidance came out, banking on the notion that the FDA would recommend an older version of the virus. When the strain guidance was issued, upending that assumption, Novavax didn’t have time to switch gears. Its vaccine, which the FDA nonetheless approved, came to market a little later than the mRNA shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nimbleness of the mRNA platform will be of critical importance when the next pandemic starts, especially if it is triggered by a flu virus. Most flu vaccines are made using a fussy process in which large amounts of virus are grown in hen’s eggs, then inactivated. The approach takes months, and can be especially difficult when manufacturers are working with a new virus; it takes time to figure out how to optimize growth. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, which was blessedly mild as pandemics go, the U.S. started to roll out its mostly egg-based vaccines as the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/11/h1n1-swine-flu-10-years-later/"&gt;fall wave of the pandemic was sharply declining&lt;/a&gt;. Many countries had no vaccine, or vaccine that arrived so late it was no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines produced in eggs will undoubtedly be part of the response to the next flu pandemic; much of the existing season vaccine manufacturing is built on this platform. Still, the demand for pandemic flu vaccine will exceed the amount made for seasonal flu campaigns, and the mRNA platform offers a speed that egg-based production cannot match. But whereas people were eager to get the mRNA shots early in the Covid pandemic, acceptance of these vaccines has declined over time. Part of that is likely because people don’t fear Covid in the way they did a few years ago — nor should they. As a species, we have acquired a lot more immunological armor with which to fight off the worst of Covid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But less fear of the virus does not fully explain the sharp drop in Covid vaccine uptake that has been reported. There is a distrust of, and dislike of mRNA vaccines among some people. Though the risk of death from Covid still exceeds that of dying from flu, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/22/flu-vaccine-demand-covid-vaccine/"&gt;about twice as many people&lt;/a&gt; got a fall flu shot for the 2023-24 season versus a Covid booster. Data for the current cold, Covid, and flu season show a similar trend, with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;only 44% of adults aged 65&lt;/a&gt; and older having gotten a Covid shot compared to 68% who got a flu shot, even though Covid poses the greater risk for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the resistance to mRNA vaccines falls along political divides, at least in the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/03/07/how-americans-view-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-amid-declining-levels-of-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A survey of 10,133 adults&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Pew Research Center in February 2024 found a 42-percentage point gap between Democrats who had had a recent Covid booster compared to Republicans. While the gap has existed since the early days of Covid vaccination, it has widened over time.&lt;/p&gt;



		
		
&lt;p&gt;The concern about the vaccine platform isn’t just political and it isn’t just in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11564657/pdf/41541_2024_Article_1019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A study analyzing global attitudes towards mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; on the social media platform X — previously known as Twitter — from June 2022 to May 2023 found a widespread lack of confidence in the safety and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, with much of the discussion anchored in misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Compared to traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have faced heightened distrust and safety concerns from the public, reflecting wariness towards novel medicines and vaccines, and worries over their emergency use authorization,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been all sorts of unfounded rumors about the vaccines, from suggestions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nicki-minajs-covid-19-vaccine-tweet-about-swollen-testicles-signals-the-dangers-of-celebrity-misinformation-and-fandom-168242" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;they affect fertility&lt;/a&gt; to the truly bizarre notion that they are a delivery mechanism for tracking microchips that billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates wanted implanted in untold millions of people, leading a befuddled Gates to ask on X &lt;a href="https://x.com/BillGates/status/1480973364080435205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“why would I want to do that?”&lt;/a&gt; Florida’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, whose views on a number of issues &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/22/florida-policy-set-amid-measles-outbreak-alarms-vaccination-proponents/"&gt;do not conform&lt;/a&gt; with those of the public health mainstream, has &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2024/01/20240103-halt-use-covid19-mrna-vaccines.pr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called for the discontinuation&lt;/a&gt; of use of mRNA vaccines, which he argues could result in contaminated DNA being integrated into the DNA of vaccine recipients.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no serious evidence that this is the case and, more broadly, the safety profile of mRNA vaccines has now been firmly established. Never before have so many doses of a new type of vaccine been given to so many people in so many countries over such a short period of time, while health agencies like the CDC, FDA, and the European Medicines Agency were&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; assiduously monitoring for reports of side effects among users&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the world is to get rapid access to large volumes of vaccine to combat a new infection in the next pandemic, we will need mRNA vaccines — that is, assuming the platform works for the new pandemic virus. But given the persistent denigration of mRNA, people may shy from accepting a shot when the next new flu virus or coronavirus makes its way into the human population. And that would undoubtedly make a bad situation worse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="h-mitigation-measures-can-help-but-may-be-difficult-to-deploy" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mitigation measures can help but may be difficult to deploy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, public health authorities reached for what are known as non-pharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, to slow the spread of the virus. Things like closing schools, churches, and theaters, wearing masks, banning public gatherings, and quarantining households with infected family members. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is anecdotal evidence that such measures yielded benefits in the 1918 Spanish flu. But by modern standards, where policies are ideally based on evidence tested in rigorous studies, this was the equivalent of grasping at straws. There wasn’t scientific proof that having the general public wear masks would slow the spread of the virus. The idea behind school closures was a solid hunch, given that kids generally catch respiratory diseases first and act as amplifiers, spreading infection to the adults in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;



		
		
&lt;p&gt;The idea of limiting international and even internal travel, in some cases even closing borders — as happened in the early days of Covid — was actually discouraged. The International Health Regulations, a global treaty aimed at persuading countries to disclose infectious disease events with the potential to spread across borders, states that reporting countries should not be penalized with trade and travel sanctions for meeting their disclosure obligations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, as it became clear that the world was in the early stages of a pandemic, public health authorities in multiple jurisdictions closed borders, shut schools, limited restaurants to take-out services, banned public gatherings — all measures aimed at trying to “&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/flattening-curve-coronavirus/"&gt;flatten the curve&lt;/a&gt;” in epidemiological jargon frequently heard in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, these measures worked to slow the virus’ spread. And they probably helped to curtail the spread of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/02/pandemic-upside-flu-virus-became-less-diverse-simplifying-task-of-making-flu-shots/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; pathogens too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because they were generally layered on top of each other, it’s not possible, really, to estimate how well each of the NPIs worked individually, or whether some combinations work better than others. Nor is it clear if some of the really loathed interventions — school closures top the list — could have been sidestepped with more attention paid to other measures. It is devilishly difficult to do rigorous science in real-world settings in crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case might be, public health officials might find it nearly impossible to try to use these measures when the next pandemic starts. Politicians in multiple parts of the country have taken action &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/over-half-of-states-have-rolled-back-public-health-powers-in-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to remove some of these tools from the public health toolbox&lt;/a&gt; — banning mask mandates and putting decisions about school closures or other such measures into the hands of school boards or elected officials rather than public health departments. Ironically, Covid may have shown us these tools work — and put them out of reach, at least in some places. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public’s willingness to abide by these types of measures is also unclear. A &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/07/americans-reflect-on-nations-covid-19-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large poll of more than 10,000 adults&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Pew in 2022 found decidedly mixed views on how U.S. officials had made decisions during the Covid pandemic. A majority of respondents (62%) didn’t feel the needs of schoolchildren were given adequate importance — a comment on school closures. The poll found a clear partisan divide in assessing respondents’ views of whether the country had made the right call on things like respecting individual freedoms, supporting the health of businesses, and protecting the public’s health, with Republicans feeling the first two weren’t given enough importance, and the latter given too much weight. Democrats, on the other hand, felt more positively about many of the public health measures used to combat Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1030747" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A more recent but substantially smaller survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the de Beaumont Foundation found greater support for four pandemic policies — mask wearing, requiring health workers to be vaccinated against Covid, banning indoor dining in restaurants, and school closures. But even there, views were mixed and there were stark differences along political lines about whether these measures had been in general a good idea in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;



		
		
&lt;p&gt;So what might we face when the next pandemic hits? There are reasons to be concerned that Covid has left us in worse shape, not better, to respond to the next such crisis. But each pandemic has its own personality. Some, like Covid, are more severe, while others, like the 2009 H1N1 flu, are mild. Casting forward while looking through Covid-tinted lenses may not fully capture what life might be like during the next pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid, for example, was far harder on older adults than it was on young children. Of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 1.15 million U.S. Covid deaths&lt;/a&gt; reported to the CDC between 2020 and the end of September 2023, only 1,700 were children aged 17 and younger, or 0.1% of all Covid deaths. Flu pandemics, on the other hand, are often tough on young children. Adults 65 and older sailed through the 2009 pandemic, for the most part. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128617/pdf/pone.0021690.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;School-aged children, teenagers, and younger adults&lt;/a&gt; were more likely to be sickened. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the next pandemic is severe for young children and teenagers, much of the reluctance to adopt control measures stemming from the Covid experience may quickly evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Their study reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can persist in the brain’s protective layers (the meninges) and the skull’s bone marrow for up to four years after infection. This lingering spike protein may drive chronic inflammation and heighten the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Prof. Ali Ertürk, Director of the Institute for Intelligent Biotechnologies at Helmholtz Munich, the research also found that mRNA &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;COVID-19&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;First identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19, or Coronavirus disease 2019, (which was originally called &amp;amp;quot;2019 novel coronavirus&amp;amp;quot; or 2019-nCoV) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has spread globally, resulting in the 2019–22 coronavirus pandemic.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; vaccines significantly reduce spike protein buildup in the brain. Despite this reduction, spike proteins that remain in the skull and meninges after infection could be targeted by new therapeutic approaches to mitigate long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="news-text-wrap"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Spike Protein Accumulates in the Brain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel AI-powered imaging technique developed by Prof. Ali Ertürk’s team provides new insights into how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects the brain. The method renders organs and tissue samples transparent, enabling the three-dimensional visualization of cellular structures, metabolites, and, in this case, viral proteins. Using this technology, the researchers uncovered previously undetectable distributions of spike protein in tissue samples from COVID-19 patients and mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Host &amp;amp; Microbe&lt;/em&gt;, revealed significantly elevated concentrations of spike protein in the skull’s bone marrow and meninges, even years after infection. The spike protein binds to so-called ACE2 receptors, which are particularly abundant in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This may make these tissues especially vulnerable to the long-term accumulation of spike protein,” explains Dr. Zhouyi Rong, the study’s first author. Ertürk adds, “Our data also suggest that persistent spike protein at the brain’s borders may contribute to the long-term neurological effects of COVID-19 and Long COVID. This includes accelerated brain aging, potentially leading to a loss of five to ten years of healthy brain function in affected individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Impact of Vaccination on Spike Protein Levels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ertürk team discovered that the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces the accumulation of spike protein in the brain. Other mRNA vaccines or vaccine types, such as vector- or protein-based vaccines, were not investigated. Mice vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine showed lower levels of spike protein in both brain tissue and the skull’s bone marrow compared to unvaccinated mice. However, the reduction was only around 50%, leaving residual spike protein that continues to pose a toxic risk to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This reduction is an important step,” says Prof. Ertürk. “Our results, while derived from mouse models and only partially transferable to humans, point to the need for additional therapies and interventions to fully address the long-term burdens caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.” Furthermore, additional studies are needed to evaluate the relevance of these findings for Long COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges and Advances in Long COVID Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, 50 to 60 percent of the population has been infected with COVID-19, with five to ten percent experiencing Long COVID. This sums up to approximately 400 million individuals who may carry significant amounts of spike protein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not just an individual health issue – it is a societal challenge,” says Prof. Ertürk. “Our study shows that mRNA vaccines significantly reduce the risk of long-term neurological consequences and offer crucial protection. However, infections can still occur post-vaccination, leading to persistent spike proteins in the body. These can result in chronic brain inflammation and an increased risk of strokes and other brain injuries, which could have substantial implications for global public health and healthcare systems worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Diagnosing and Treating Long COVID&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open new possibilities for diagnosing and treating the long-term neurological effects of COVID-19,” says Ertürk. Unlike brain tissue, the skull’s bone marrow and meninges – areas prone to spike protein accumulation – are more accessible for medical examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with protein panels – tests designed to detect specific proteins in tissue samples – this could allow for the identification of spike proteins or inflammatory markers in blood &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;plasma&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter, along with solid, liquid, and gas. It is an ionized gas consisting of positive ions and free electrons. It was first described by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;plasma&lt;/span&gt; or cerebrospinal fluid. “Such markers are critical for the early diagnosis of COVID-19-related neurological complications,” Ertürk explains. “Additionally, characterizing these proteins may support the development of targeted therapies and biomarkers to better treat or even prevent neurological impairments caused by COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the broader impact of the study, leading Helmholtz Munich and Technical University of Munich virologist Prof. Ulrike Protzer adds: “Given the ongoing global impact of COVID-19 and the increasing focus on long-term effects, this study, which sheds light on brain invasion pathways and unexpected long-term host involvement, is timely. These critical insights are not only scientifically significant but also of great interest to society.”&lt;/p&gt;

For locals, the polar night is part of life, and many thrive, embracing the season. Some even say they sleep better than they do at other times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Polar night is too short," says Esther Berelowitsch, 42, who lives in Inari, Finland, where the polar night lasts for six weeks. "I'd love if it lasted for two months. Nature shows itself even when there's no sunlight... I go to bed earlier and sleep better. I don't want spring to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Yet research shows that others become &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08039480902799040" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;sad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945714001531" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;sluggish&lt;/a&gt; when winter starts – deprived of the sunlight, their mood drops and depression can set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But people who live and work in Arctic have also learned to cope with the challenges that the dramatic change in the seasons can mean for their sleep. There is certainly some evidence that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb00372.x" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;local people are better acclimatised&lt;/a&gt; to the sleeping problems they might encounter during the polar night than those visiting from lower latitudes. So, what can the rest of us learn from Arctic residents about our own sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="think-positive" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="think-positive" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Think positive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the far north of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greenland, Russia, Canada and Alaska, the Sun remains below the horizon for much of the winter. For how long exactly depends on the location: in Rovaniemi, the capital of Finnish Lapland, right on the Arctic Circle, polar night lasts for only two days during winter solstice. In Tromsø, the largest town in northern Norway, 350km (217 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, it's about six weeks, from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://fhi.brage.unit.no/fhi-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2723897/Sivertsen_2020_Sle.pdf?sequence=1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;late November to mid-January&lt;/a&gt;.

The researchers found the Sámi tended to have a more relaxed attitude towards sleep, with even children being left to self-regulate their own sleep rather than sticking to regular bedtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For Michèle Noach, an artist who shares her time between the UK and Vadsø, a town in the far north-east of Norway close to the Russian border, the polar night induces a feeling of coziness where she just wants to curl up and snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But Leibowitz thinks something else might be going on too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Those with a negative mindset are fighting against winter," says Leibowitz. "For example they put on big lights to push away the darkness. But that just makes things worse: they create a contrast that makes the outside world even darker – and overlighting may also disrupt their sleep." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="turn-down-the-lights" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="turn-down-the-lights" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Turn down the lights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The amount of light we are exposed to during the day plays an important role in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1527773#abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;setting our circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, helping to regulate the amount of melatonin our bodies produce. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the brain from the evening onwards, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4334454/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;preparing our body for sleep&lt;/a&gt; and so playing a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The almost perpetual winter darkness in the Arctic can play havoc with melatonin production, with some studies showing a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/ijch.v62i3.17561" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;large spike in melatonin at the peak of the polar night in mid-January&lt;/a&gt;. Melatonin levels then decrease as the sunlight begins to return at the end of the month. This would be fine, except for those working on a set daily schedule that requires them to be at work or up and about at a certain time. During the periods of highest melatonin production, participants in a study by researchers at the University of Tromsø reported &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/ijch.v62i3.17561" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;feeling much more tired in the mornings&lt;/a&gt; than they did in the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Artificial lighting, however, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.14144" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;cannot fully replicate&lt;/a&gt; the levels of sunlight needed to maintain stable sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Håkan Långstedt, an engineer based in Helsinki, Finland, and managing director of lighting design company SAAS Instruments, recommends soft lighting during the polar night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"If you have a lot of darkness, you don't need a lot of light to compensate," he says.

"It's not something cut with a knife: it gradually goes from light to something darker."

"People go to bed later and if they have to wake up at a certain hour because they have to go to work, their sleep will be cut short," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Lowden and his colleagues &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33089157/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;conducted a sleep study&lt;/a&gt; involving office workers in Kiruna in northern Sweden where the polar night lasts for 28 days.

"Our bodies operate a 24-hour cycle in which to perform their functions. Almost all our organs are organised in cycles, in a way that one time of the day they're active, and another time they're recuperating and restoring cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"If your circadian rhythm is disrupted, you'll be sleepy during the day," says Lowden.

"If you're more of an evening type, there's a danger that you'll sacrifice some of your sleep to meet society's demands. If you can't follow your own chronotype, try to be at least as consistent as possible with your sleep schedule: you'll sleep better and feel better for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Taken together, these findings suggest that sticking to the exact same daily schedule throughout the year may not be the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"If you have flexibility in your private life and in your job, you're better off if you adapt your schedules to the seasons and give yourself more time to sleep in the winter than the summer," says Leibowitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="slow-down-and-enjoy-good-company" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="slow-down-and-enjoy-good-company" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Slow down and enjoy good company&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Berelowitsch, who loves the polar night, says it gives her an opportunity to slow down and engage in quiet pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I've noticed that in my free time I do everything slower – I walk slow, eat slow, sleep slow," she says.

&lt;p&gt;The disease, caused by the bacterium &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisella_tularensis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, can be transmitted to humans in many ways, including bites from infected ticks and deer flies, and skin contact with infected rabbits, hares, and rodents, all of which are particularly susceptible to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148285" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Macrophage_Infected_with_Francisella_tularensis_Bacteria_5950310835.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-148285 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Macrophage_Infected_with_Francisella_tularensis_Bacteria_5950310835.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Macrophage_Infected_with_Francisella_tularensis_Bacteria_5950310835-396x415.jpg 396w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Macrophage_Infected_with_Francisella_tularensis_Bacteria_5950310835-600x628.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148285" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria shown in blue. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Macrophage_Infected_with_Francisella_tularensis_Bacteria_(5950310835).jpg"&gt;NIAID/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are far gnarlier routes of transmission possible: &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4304-4305.2005"&gt;lawn mowing&lt;/a&gt; over the nests of animals infected with the disease has been reported to aerosolize the bacteria, infecting the unwitting gardener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa011374"&gt;first recorded&lt;/a&gt; at a Massachusetts vineyard in 2000, where the resulting tularemia outbreak lasted six months and resulted in 15 identified cases and one reported death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one of another handful of cases reported in Colorado in 2014 and 2015 was also linked to a lawn-mowing incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC keeps a close eye on this bacterium, in part because it's classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.selectagents.gov/compliance/guidance/biosafety/definitions.htm"&gt;Tier 1 Select Agent&lt;/a&gt; by the US government for its bioterrorism potential, and also because even when it's transmitted naturally, it can be lethal without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The case fatality rate of tularemia is typically less than 2 percent but can be higher depending on clinical manifestation and infecting strain," the report's authors &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm735152a1.htm?s_cid=mm735152a1_w"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tularemia is relatively uncommon in the scheme of things: across 47 states, 2,462 cases were recorded for the decade 2011-2022. By comparison, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; around 1.35 million cases of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; bacterium poisoning occur across the country each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those 2,462 tularemia cases amount to just one case among every 200,000 people, it's a 56 percent higher incidence rate than records from 2001-2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this probably comes from improvements in the way we record cases: in 2017, the CDC began including cases where &lt;i&gt;F. tularensis &lt;/i&gt;was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the 'probable case' count, which had previously included only cases where a person had symptoms, plus a few molecular markers hinting at the bacteria's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with symptoms, for a case to be 'confirmed' a sample of the bacteria must be isolated from the infected person's body, or a massive change in related  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="148260" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in serum testing will also suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2011-2022 data, there were 984 confirmed cases and 1,475 probable cases. That's 60 percent of the total cases classified as probable, a massive shift from the 2001-2010 data, where just 35 percent of cases were deemed probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Increased reporting of probable cases might be associated with an actual increase in human infection, improved tularemia detection, or both," the CDC team &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm735152a1.htm?s_cid=mm735152a1_w#suggestedcitation"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. Commercially available laboratory tests also varied during this period, potentially impacting the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148283" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-148283 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101.jpg 2121w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/GettyImages-172857101-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2121px) 100vw, 2121px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148283" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mowing over infected animals' nests and carcasses has been identified as a potential transmission source. (kozmoat98/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidence among the country's First Nations people, as defined by the CDC demographic category 'American Indian or Alaska Native', was around five times greater than among White people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many factors might contribute to the higher risk for tularemia in this population, including the concentration of Native American reservations in central states and sociocultural or occupational activities that might increase contact with infected wildlife or arthropods," the report's authors &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm735152a1.htm?s_cid=mm735152a1_w"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others most affected by the disease were children aged five to nine years old, 65- to 84-year-old men, and people generally living in the central US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to diagnose tularemia because the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms vary greatly&lt;/a&gt; depending on mode of transmission. But better awareness about those routes of infection can help us &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/prevention/index.html"&gt;avoid exposure&lt;/a&gt; and help doctors identify and treat the disease with antibiotics quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see the CDC's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm735152a1.htm?s_cid=mm735152a1_w"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rare illness in Belgium that affected nine people was likely spread after the initial patient ate pork while abroad several years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human cysticercosis results from ingesting Taenia solium eggs shed by a tapeworm carrier, forming cystic larvae in tissues. Upon consumption by humans, they develop into a new intestinal tapeworm. Affecting the brain, neurocysticercosis is responsible for a third of epilepsy cases in endemic tropical and subtropical regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between March and June 2023, neurocysticercosis was diagnosed in three boys from different classes and years at a primary school in Belgium, a non-endemic country. The first patient presented with ptosis for a year, and the other two had new-onset focal seizures. Department Zorg (the Department of Care) in the Flemish Ministry of Welfare, Public Health and Family provided several updates on the incident at Het Molentje primary school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a study recently &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02356-0/fulltext"&gt;published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, one patient was confirmed as having neurocysticercosis by brain-biopsy PCR, and the other two by imaging and treatment response. No tapeworm was detected in the patients or their relatives with negative fecal exams and no travel abroad was reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists initially suspected food contamination and searched for the tapeworm carrier by testing feces of 70 school catering staff, volunteers who peeled fruit, teachers, and parents who cooked for festivities. They tested pupils who visited endemic countries based on a questionnaire, and sampled school wastewater in mid-March 2024. The team also conducted serology and brain MRIs for two families with multiple risk factors to find signs of past exposure. All tests were negative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of information sessions and national television coverage on the spread of cysticercosis, some parents arranged brain MRIs privately, uncovering two more asymptomatic boys at the primary school with neurocysticercosis in October and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological investigations revealed that a single exposure event likely happened between September 2021, when one of the patients was newly admitted to the school, and January, 2022, when the first patient had already developed ptosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the academic year 2021 to 2022, there were 229 primary school and 149 kindergarten students. These pupils were offered a brain MRI between February and June 2024. This revealed two more boys with asymptomatic neurocysticercosis and one with a calcified cerebral lesion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumption of pork abroad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the last patient was invited for history taking, his father described pulling a 1 m-long, ribbon-like worm from his son’s bottom; the boy then received a dose of mebendazole in August 2022. When abroad in an area endemic with Taenia solium before 2021, he consumed pork from pigs raised in uncontrolled housing conditions. The father became the ninth patient when he was diagnosed with asymptomatic neurocysticercosis, with a second lesion in his right temporal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All but one of the other family members tested positive. This suggests the boy carried the pork tapeworm causing the outbreak. Although beef tapeworm is endemic in Belgium, it does not cause human cysticercosis. As repeated fecal tests remained clear, transmission had probably ceased; household members also tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identification of three symptomatic Belgian children with cysticercosis prompted the outbreak response, revealing six more asymptomatic patients, including the likely source. Most patients were treated with a favorable outcome. At the time of the study, all patients were seizure-free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transmission could have occurred through hand contact or indirect fecal–oral contact during boys’ activities or in the boys’ bathroom, explaining why only males appeared to be affected and why half of the children were in one class and year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers thanked colleagues from the Neurocysticercosis Expert Group at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for their assistance in addressing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

And how can we make sense of lengthy ingredients lists?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;Today, we’ll &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/05/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-challenge-quiz.html" title=""&gt;play a game to explore your buying habits&lt;/a&gt; — but first, let’s review some basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn"&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-gcv50g e1gnsphs0" id="link-1a2fb686"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are ultraprocessed foods?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;Ultraprocessed foods, or UPFs, are commonly defined as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-harmful-health.html" title=""&gt;products you couldn’t typically make in your own kitchen&lt;/a&gt;. They contain ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, protein isolates, emulsifiers and artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners. Think chicken nuggets, hot dogs, flavored yogurts, sodas and many breakfast cereals, packaged breads and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;We don’t have a clear picture of when ultraprocessed foods started to dominate our diets. They have been part of the American food supply &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;for decades&lt;/a&gt;, but they probably got a boost in the 1980s and ’90s, when tobacco companies bought several major food companies. The products made by those companies were more likely to have combinations of fat, sugar, carbohydrates or sodium that made them hard to stop eating, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16332" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;. And over time, our consumption of them has gradually crept up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;Today, ultraprocessed foods make up a majority of what we eat — nearly 60 percent of the calories &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)00125-3/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; consume in the United States, and nearly 70 percent of the calories consumed by &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782866" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;children and teens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-gcv50g e1gnsphs0" id="link-28182893"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do ultraprocessed foods affect our health?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;There’s a lot scientists are still learning about ultraprocessed foods, but public health experts are increasingly warning that they may be contributing to poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers have linked ultraprocessed foods to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;32 health concerns&lt;/a&gt;, including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain gastrointestinal conditions and some types of cancer. Studies have also found links between ultraprocessed foods and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268228/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;But it’s not clear whether all ultraprocessed foods are harmful for us. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-types-unhealthy-study.html" title=""&gt;One recent study&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, suggested that some, like flavored yogurts and cereal, were not. It’s also unclear if ultraprocessed foods directly cause poor health, or if it is caused by other aspects of people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;It may take decades for researchers to work through exactly why UPFs are connected to negative health outcomes. Still, most experts agree there’s enough evidence to suggest we should eat less ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-daiqw4 evys1bk0"&gt;But we have families to feed and overwhelming supermarket choices to face. So where to start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-gcv50g e1gnsphs0" id="link-7b3fb9e1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Well Challenge Day 1: How often do you buy ultraprocessed foods?

                  &lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found this part fascinating. Have I been wrong about it my whole life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(By the way, if you think that a pound or an ounce is a unit of weight, and not mass, that's a common (but potentially dangerous) misconception. Read the full discussion of this in this Frink FAQ entry.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is the pound a measure of mass, not force (or currency?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, in the United States, the pound has been officially defined to be a unit of mass since at least 1893 (by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, and later by its successor, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), which was formed in 1901. The National Bureau of Standards was renamed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1988.) It has had its current value since 1959, defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms (also a unit of mass,) both by official notice in the Federal Register, giving it the effect of official U.S. policy, and as an official refinement by the National Bureau of Standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter document is very detailed and authoritative, and shows the very slightly different values it had in 1893 (then defined as 1/2.20462 kg, a mass), the value from 1894-1959 (then defined as 1/2.2062234 kg, also a mass, which only differs from the current exact value of 0.45359237 kg by about 1 part in 10 million.) All are quite unambiguous on this point. No standards body has, as far as I can tell, defined pound as a unit of anything other than mass, at least since 1893. (Legislation before that was ambiguous about the distinction between mass and weight.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the pound has been officially defined as a mass since the Weights and Measures Act of 1878, which defined it as having a very slightly smaller value (equal to approximately 0.453592338 kg.) The value of the pound was unified to its current value in all countries by 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "pound-force" or "lbf" is a measure of force, though. But that's not the pound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the pound-force in Frink, use lbf or pound force (with no hyphen, which would be indistinguishable from subtraction.) The unit force is a synonym for the unit gravity, which is the standard acceleration of gravity, defined to be exactly 9.80665 m/s2. The "pound-force" is defined as the mass of a pound multiplied by the standard accleration of gravity as defined above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details from the (U.S.) National Institute of Standards and Technology:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appendix B9 of the NIST Guide to SI Units. Please note that the pound is only listed in the mass section and not in the force section. This is from NIST Special Publication 811 which is considered authoritative.
NIST Handbook 133, Appendix E. (This document and its predecessor, NIST Handbook 44, use italics or underlining to show the units that are defined in terms of the survey foot. (I'm glad to see that the 2007 version of this publication apparently contains fixes for most of the several errors that I reported and they acknowledged but sat on for 3 years since first reporting!)
Official definitions from other countries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the United Kingdom's National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML), the definition of pound as a mass. Also see their FAQ.
U.K. Weights and Measures Act part I, section 1.1, defines the pound as a mass of exactly 0.45359237 kilogram.
Canada's Weights and Measures Act (this is rather fuzzy-headed; it defines the pound as exactly "45 359 237/100 000 000 kilogram" (a mass) but does so under the heading "Measurement of Mass or Weight".) It correctly defines the kilogram as a measure of mass earlier. If the pound is defined as a multiple of the kilogram, and the kilogram is mass, then the pound must be a mass also. This legislation should be amended to remove the misleading heading.
Highly-regarded reference books like the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 83rd Edition (2002-2003) has the definition given above in terms of the kilogram. The pound is, again, a mass and nothing else. (This is also true in the 1960 edition, but the 1960 edition has some non-self-consistent uses of "foot pound" as a unit of energy which has been corrected in later versions, which cite only "foot pound-force" as a measure of energy. Thanks to Bob Williams for the historical research.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised too when I first started researching the pound. I had been told it was a unit of force by one engineering professor, and I believed it. It turns out he was wrong, I was wrong, and I realized I had better unlearn my mistakes and start using the right terminology before I made a big, costly blunder. If you don't believe it, please do your own research and it might help change your mind. You don't have to believe me, but I think you should believe your own country's standards bodies (and probably comply with your country's legislative definitions if you don't want to breach contracts!) After all, if you don't use the units properly when they're unambigously defined by both standards bodies and law, then you're the one with the liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can find any evidence that a standards body in the United States or any other country has ever defined pound as anything but mass (well, at least in the past century,) please send it to Alan Eliasen. Please, authoritative references only--not some individual's webpage or old confused textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have this discussion over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that most men, including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly taught to others, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into the fabric of their lives." --Leo Tolstoy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the British currency, use GBP or Britain_Pound, or, for the historical buying power of the pound in, say, the year 1752, try pound_1752.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cheap pork recipe:  At US grocery prices, roasted pork for ~$0.33 an ounce -- 3 ounces makes a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;meaty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt; sandwich:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get 2 Picnic Pork Shoulder roasts, ~9 pounds each. On a 'V' roasting rack (I found a strong one, no moving parts, in stainless steel) in a common turkey roasting pan, place the two roasts, skin side down.  Roast in 210 F oven to internal temperature ~180 F, ~22 hours.  This time and temperature is an example of the old rule "low and slow".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three old food chemistry claims:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) For food safety, it is sufficient to cook meat to 165 F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Cooking meat much over 180 F for too long results in the proteins &lt;i&gt;unwinding&lt;/i&gt;, expelling their water, and becoming dry and tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) Meat, not overcooked, is tough only due to collagen.  If not overcooked, the meat fibers are always tender.  Collagen melts at ~160 F.  So &lt;i&gt;low and slow&lt;/i&gt; achieves food safety and melts out the collagen without overcooking the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at ~180 F, separate skin, fat, bone, and lean meat.  Can freeze the lean meat in 2 quart covered plastic containers.  Freezes well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat, one version:  With one of the 2 quart containers unfrozen, weigh out some of the cooked pork, say 6 ounces.  Add ~3 ounces (weight) of some BBQ sauce.  Cover and warm in microwave.  Then, with a knife and fork, the meat fibers will separate easily, and that will also mix in the BBQ sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serve on hamburger buns or toasted bread slices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cheap pizza recipe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Sam's Club can get Fleishmann's
Active Dry yeast, 2 packages, each package 1 pound, $6.18, $0.19/ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, ~750 milligrams of water, 1 tablespoon of the yeast, and 1 kilogram of "bread and pizza flour" (Sam's), can make 8 small pizzas.  To one of the 8, add tomato sauce, Mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel way to cook, without an oven:  Get e.g., Amazon, $7.59, a roll of sheet Teflon, and cut a piece to fit the bottom of a standard 10 inch top, inside diameter, cast iron frying pan, $7.88 at Walmart.  Will want a cover, and I use one, perfect fit, from a glass casserole dish, but Amazon sells some such pans with covers. Place the raw pizza on the Teflon in the frying pan, add the cover, place over &lt;i&gt;medium&lt;/i&gt; stove top burner heat, can be ready to eat in ~19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1 and 750 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Exercise training while wearing a weighted vest is undergoing somewhat of a renaissance. Social media &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8z2srDOj2_/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/zelus-weighted-vest-review-amazon-2024-8741777"&gt;trainers&lt;/a&gt; are promoting them as a potential strategy for improving fitness and health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising with additional weight attached to the body is nothing new. This idea has been used with soldiers for &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258883795_The_History_of_the_Soldier's_Load"&gt;many centuries if not millennia&lt;/a&gt; – think long hikes with a heavy pack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern weighted vest comes in a range of designs that are more comfortable and can be adjusted in terms of the weight added. But could one be helpful for you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What the research says&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest research studies, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00435733"&gt;reported in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, followed 36 older people wearing weighted vests during a weekly exercise class and at home over a 20-week period. Wear was associated with improvements in bone health, pain and physical function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22weighted%20vest%22&amp;amp;filter=pubt.clinicaltrial&amp;amp;filter=pubt.meta-analysis&amp;amp;sort=pubdate"&gt;dozens of papers&lt;/a&gt; have evaluated the exercise effects of wearing a weighted vest, reporting a range of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, exercise with a weighted vest &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2021.1961876"&gt;increases physiological stress&lt;/a&gt; – or how hard the body has to work – as shown by increased oxygen uptake, heart rate, carbohydrate utilisation and energy expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding weight equal to 10% of body weight is effective. But &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2021.1961876"&gt;it doesn’t appear the body works significantly harder&lt;/a&gt; when wearing 5% extra weight compared to body weight alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBbjtfnvP_3","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does more load mean greater injury risk?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2021.1961876#abstract"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested additional weights don’t alter the biomechanics of walking or running. These are important considerations for lower-limb injury risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safety considerations of exercising with weighted vests have also been &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14763141.2018.1508490"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in a biomechanical study of treadmill running with added weight of 1% to 10% of body weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While physiological demand (indicated by heart rate) was higher with additional weight and the muscular forces greater, running motion was not negatively affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date no research studies have reported increased injuries due to wearing weighted vests for recreational exercise. However a 2018 clinical study on weight loss in people with obesity found &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jfa.2018.17"&gt;back pain in 25% of those wearing such vests&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this can be translated to recreational use in people who don’t have obesity is difficult to say. As always, if pain or discomfort is experienced then you should reduce the weight or stop vest training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Better for weight loss or bone health?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wearing a weighted vest increases the energy expenditure of aerobic and resistance exercise, research to show it leads to greater fat loss or retaining muscle mass is somewhat inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00296-012-2388-2"&gt;older study&lt;/a&gt; investigated treadmill walking for 30 minutes, three times a week in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The researchers found greater fat loss and muscle gain in the participants who wore a weighted vest (at 4–8% body weight). But subsequent &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jfa.2018.17"&gt;research in obese older adults&lt;/a&gt; could not show greater fat loss in participants who wore weighted vests for an average of 6.7 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been considerable interest in the use of weighted vests to improve bone health in older people. One &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1099800402239628"&gt;2003 study&lt;/a&gt; reported significant improvements in bone density in a group of older women over 32 weeks of weighted vest walking and strength training compared to a sedentary control group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00296-012-2388-2"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; found no difference in bone metabolism between groups of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis walking on a treadmill with or without a weighted vest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any exercise, there is a risk of injury if it is not done correctly. But the risk of weighted vest training appears low and can be managed with appropriate exercise progression and technique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are new to training, then the priority should be to simply start exercising and not complicate it with wearing a weighted vest. The use of body weight alone will be sufficient to get you on the path to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/the-advantages-of-body-weight-exercise"&gt;considerable gains in fitness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a good foundation of strength, aerobic fitness and resilience for muscles, joints and bones, using a weighted vest could provide greater loading intensity as well as variation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to start with a lighter weight (such as 5% bodyweight) and build to no more than 10% body weight for ground impact exercises such as running, jogging or walking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For resistance training such as squats, push-ups or chin-ups, progression can be achieved by increasing loads and adjusting the number of repetitions for each set to around 10 to 15. So, heavier loads but fewer repetitions, then building up to increase the load over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While weighted vests can be used for resistance training, it is probably easier and more convenient to use barbells, dumbbells, kettle bells or weighted bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/638790/original/file-20241216-15-cbe4zb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The benefits of added weight can also be achieved by adding repetition or duration.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/group-of-people-in-gym-while-exercising-3RnkZpDqsEI"&gt;Geert Pieters/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighted vest training is just one tool in an absolute plethora of equipment, techniques and systems. Yes, walking or jogging with around 10% extra body weight increases energy expenditure and intensity. But training for a little bit longer or at a higher intensity can achieve similar results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be benefits for bone health in wearing a weighted vest during ground-based exercise such as walking or jogging. But similar or greater stimulus to bone growth can be achieved by resistance training or even the introduction of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jbmr/article/38/11/1612/7610456"&gt;impact training&lt;/a&gt; such as hopping, skipping or &lt;a href="https://simplifaster.com/articles/teach-train-bounding-exercise/"&gt;bounding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising with a weighted vest likely won’t increase your injury risk. But it must be approached intelligently considering fitness level, existing and previous injuries, and appropriate progression for intensity and repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

                                        Neil Willenson was a college student with dreams of becoming an actor when he met Nile Sandeen, a 5-year-old boy with HIV. As a 22-year-old in 1993, Willenson pivoted from his Hollywood dreams and founded a camp, One Heartland, so that Sandeen and other children with HIV—who were often isolated and experienced the discrimination that came along with a lack of understanding of the virus and how it was transmitted—could experience the simple pleasures of being kids. Now, more than three decades later, that camp is closing—because the number of kids contracting HIV has plummeted.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        In recent years, the camp has served other populations, including kids with diabetes and LGBTQ+ youth, and the nonprofit organization that runs it hopes to sell the Minnesota property to another kid-focused group, the &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/closure-of-northern-minnesota-camp-is-the-greatest-story-heres-why/601199362"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minneapolis Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. Despite the reason it's closing, former campers are sad to see it go. "It's a heartbreaker," says Dylan Edwards, who attended the camp with his brother, Chris, who died of HIV-related complications at age 12 in 1999. "But the purpose of the camp was for sick kids," so if there simply aren't as many anymore, "it's hard to feel bad about that," he says.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacteria &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; viruses &lt;/strong&gt;are constantly evolving, outpacing our defenses and creating new challenges in public health. A groundbreaking method developed by researchers at the&lt;strong&gt; University of Cambridge &lt;/strong&gt;promises to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;transform how we&lt;strong&gt; detect &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; respond&lt;/strong&gt; to these emerging threats&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases remain a significant global burden, with pathogens like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (whooping cough) and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(tuberculosis)&lt;/strong&gt; evolving to resist treatments and evade vaccines. Traditional surveillance systems often rely on expert panels and manual analysis, which can be slow and resource-intensive. However, a team led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Noémie Lefrancq&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Professor Julian Parkhill&lt;/strong&gt; has introduced an innovative, automated system that uses genetic sequencing to monitor pathogen evolution in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind Real-Time Pathogen Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this new method is genetic sequencing, which allows researchers to map the evolution of pathogens as they spread through populations. Unlike traditional systems that depend on expert analysis, the team’s algorithm automatically identifies genetic changes and constructs “&lt;strong&gt;family trees&lt;/strong&gt;” of pathogens. These trees reveal how quickly variants are spreading and highlight those with concerning traits, such as antibiotic resistance or increased transmissibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Professor Julian Parkhill explains, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Our method provides a completely objective way of spotting new strains of disease-causing bugs by analyzing their genetics and spread in the population&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key advantages of this approach include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Automated detection is significantly faster than manual methods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; The system can be applied to a wide range of pathogens, from bacteria to viruses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; It requires only a small number of samples, making it suitable for resource-limited settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This innovation is particularly timely, as the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of rapid variant detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Early Detection: A Game-Changer for Outbreak Response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their system on &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt;, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough. Recent outbreaks of this disease, some of the worst in decades, have highlighted the need for improved surveillance. The algorithm identified three previously undetected variants circulating in populations, demonstrating its potential to uncover hidden threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Sylvain Brisse of Institut Pasteur noted, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;This method is timely for whooping cough, given its resurgence in many countries and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also applied the technique to &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, uncovering two antibiotic-resistant variants currently spreading. This finding has immediate implications for treatment strategies. As Professor Henrik Salje, senior author of the study, explained, &lt;em&gt;“If we see a rapid expansion of an antibiotic-resistant variant, we can adapt the prescribed antibiotics to limit its spread.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By enabling early detection of such variants, this method could help prevent outbreaks and guide more effective public health responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Era of Global Disease Surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend far beyond individual pathogens. The ability to monitor pathogen evolution in real time could revolutionize global disease surveillance, particularly in low-resource settings where infectious diseases often take the heaviest toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variants like Omicron demonstrated how quickly pathogens can evolve and spread. Dr. Lefrancq emphasized the versatility of the new method, stating, &lt;em&gt;“Our new method shows surprisingly quickly whether new transmissible variants of pathogens are circulating, and it can be applied to a huge range of bacteria and viruses.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Key benefits for global health include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Responses:&lt;/strong&gt; Governments can adjust vaccine development and treatment strategies based on real-time data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equitable Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The method’s simplicity makes it accessible to regions with limited healthcare infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; It can be integrated into existing surveillance systems to address gaps in coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Addressing the Global Threat of Evolving Pathogens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relentless evolution of pathogens poses a constant challenge to public health. Genetic mutations enable viruses and bacteria to evade vaccines and resist treatments, often leading to outbreaks that catch health systems unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Salje highlighted the transformative potential of this research, stating, &lt;em&gt;“This work could completely change how governments respond to infectious diseases.”&lt;/em&gt; By integrating this method into global health strategies, nations can take proactive steps to contain threats before they escalate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The team plans to refine the technique further and explore its applications across a broader range of pathogens. As Professor Salje noted, &lt;em&gt;“This work is an important piece in the larger jigsaw of any public health response to infectious disease.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08309-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These changes include reduced activity in neuronal circuitry genes and increased activity in immunity-related genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide a detailed map of age-sensitive brain regions, offering insights into how aging may influence brain disorders like Alzheimer’s. This research could guide the development of treatments targeting aging-related brain changes and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uneven Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypothalamic neurons and ventricle-lining cells show the greatest age-related genetic changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Activity Shifts:&lt;/strong&gt; Aging reduces neuronal circuit genes but increases immunity-related genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mapping age-sensitive cells may inform treatments for aging-related brain diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on new brain mapping research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), scientists have discovered that not all cell types in the brain age in the same way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that some cells, such as a small group of hormone-controlling cells, may undergo more age-related changes in genetic activity than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, support the idea that some cells are more sensitive to the aging process and aging brain disorders than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107330"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/brain-mapping-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Like previous studies, the initial results showed a decrease in the activity of genes associated with neuronal circuits. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aging is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and many other devastating brain disorders. These results provide a highly detailed map for which brain cells may be most affected by aging,” said Richard J. Hodes, M.D., director of NIH’s National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new map may fundamentally alter the way scientists think about how aging affects the brain and also provide a guide for developing new treatments for aging-related brain diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists used advanced genetic analysis tools to study individual cells in the brains of 2-month-old “young” and 18-month-old “aged” mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each age, researchers analysed the genetic activity of a variety of cell types located in 16 different broad regions — constituting 35% of the total volume of a mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like previous studies, the initial results showed a decrease in the activity of genes associated with neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decreases were seen in neurons, the primary circuitry cells, as well as in “glial” cells called astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which can support neural signaling by controlling neurotransmitter levels and electrically insulating nerve fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, aging increased the activity of genes associated with the brain’s immunity and inflammatory systems, as well as brain blood vessel cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis helped spot which cell types may be the most sensitive to aging. For example, the results suggested that aging reduces the development of newborn neurons found in at least three different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that some of these newborn neurons may play a role in the circuitry that controls some forms of learning and memory while others may help mice recognize different smells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells that appeared to be the most sensitive to aging surround the third ventricle, a major pipeline that enables cerebrospinal fluid to pass through the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located at the base of the mouse brain, the hypothalamus produces hormones that can control the body’s basic needs, including temperature, heart rate, sleep, thirst, and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that cells lining the third ventricle and neighbouring neurons in the hypothalamus had the greatest changes in genetic activity with age, including increases in immunity genes and decreases in genes associated with neuronal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted that these observations align with previous studies on several different animals that showed links between aging and body metabolism, including those on how intermittent fasting and other calorie restricting diets can increase life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the age-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus are known to produce feeding and energy-controlling hormones while the ventricle-lining cells control the passage of hormones and nutrients between the brain and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to examine the biological mechanisms underlying the findings, as well as search for any possible links to human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was led by Kelly Jin, Ph.D., Bosiljka Tasic, Ph.D., and Hongkui Zeng, Ph.D., from the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle. The scientists used brain mapping tools — developed as part of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies®&lt;/em&gt; (BRAIN) Initiative – Cell Census Network (BICCN) — to study more than 1.2 million brain cells, or about 1% of total brain cells, from young and aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years scientists studied the effects of aging on the brain mostly one cell at a time. Now, with innovative brain mapping tools – made possible by the NIH BRAIN Initiative – researchers can study how aging affects much of the whole brain,” said John Ngai, Ph.D., director, The BRAIN Initiative®.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that examining the brain more globally can provide scientists with fresh insights on how the brain ages and how neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt normal aging activity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by NIH grants R01AG066027 and U19MH114830.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and brain mapping research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1c170d160c0b100f171a0d510b1710121e0c3f11161751181009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher Thomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christopher Thomas – NIH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08350-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain-wide cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of healthy aging in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Kelly Jin et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-wide cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of healthy aging in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 20:30:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1WMThEOTV1SWMyZnF2cG5XRHdTMUhwSjNsSThFUVRlanFVdjBhTjQyTnFOLWxHTlZFVEplcDlNV3dpTUNUX204b1lxeDdDcXY4dXFqazlabEcyc3VoUlExcnVOaE95YVV1RGJJRzh1Sl8</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic ‘microdosing’ is the new weight-loss trend: Should you try it? - Yahoo!

When pupils contract, the brain focuses on consolidating new memories; when dilated, it processes older ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separation prevents “catastrophic forgetting,” allowing the brain to efficiently manage both new and existing knowledge. These findings could lead to better memory enhancement techniques for humans and inspire more efficient artificial neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil Size and Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Contracted pupils correlate with new memory consolidation, while dilated pupils process older memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Separation:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain alternates between new and old knowledge during non-REM sleep to prevent interference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights into memory processing may help improve efficiency in artificial neural networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eyes may be the window to the soul, but the pupil is key to understanding how, and when, the brain forms strong, long-lasting memories, Cornell researchers have found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying mice equipped with brain electrodes and tiny eye-tracking cameras, the researchers determined that new memories are being replayed and consolidated when the pupil is contracted during a substage of non-REM sleep. When the pupil is dilated, the process repeats for older memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107326"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/01/pupil-size-sleep-memory-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the relationship between sleep and memory has been well established, the neural mechanisms that underpin their interplay remain murky. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s ability to separate these two substages of sleep with a previously unknown micro-structure is what prevents “catastrophic forgetting” in which the consolidation of one memory wipes out another one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could lead to better memory enhancement techniques for humans and may help computer scientists train artificial neural networks to be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Jan. 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, was led by Azahara Oliva, assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, and Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz, assistant professor and Nancy and Peter Meinig Family Investigator in the Life Sciences, both in the College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s co-lead authors were doctoral student Hongyu Chang and postdoctoral researcher Wenbo Tang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the relationship between sleep and memory has been well established, the neural mechanisms that underpin their interplay remain murky. Experiments to elucidate the process generally follow one of two lines: attempting to improve memory retention in sleeping humans, and mechanistic, cellular studies in sleeping rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining those two fields of research has proved difficult because the subjects are so different. Rodents have been thought to have a very simple, two-step sleep structure – rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when dreaming occurs, and non-REM slow-wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, humans’ slow-wave sleep is more complicated, with four stages, the deepest of which is when researchers suspect the brain sifts through and organizes its memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their joint lab, Oliva and Fernandez-Ruiz used their combined expertise in animal behavior, technology development and computational analysis to see just what goes on in a sleeping mouse’s eye – and neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a month, a group of mice was taught a variety of tasks, such as collecting water or cookie rewards in a maze. Then the mice were outfitted with brain electrodes and tiny spy cameras that hung in front of their eyes to track their pupil dynamics. One day, the mice learned a new task and when they fell asleep, the electrodes captured their neural activity and the cameras recorded the changes to their pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-REM sleep is when the actual memory consolidation happens, and these moments are very, very short periods of time undetectable by humans, like 100 milliseconds,” Oliva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How does the brain distribute these screenings of memory that are very fast and very short throughout the overall night? And how does that separate the new knowledge coming in, in a way that it doesn’t interfere with old knowledge that we already have in our minds?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recordings showed that the temporal structure of sleeping mice is more varied, and more akin to the sleep stages in humans, than previously thought. By interrupting the mice’s sleep at different moments and later testing how well they recalled their learned tasks, the researchers were able to parse the processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mouse enters a substage of non-REM sleep, its pupil shrinks, and it’s here the recently learned tasks – i.e., the new memories – are being reactivated and consolidated while previous knowledge is not. Conversely, older memories are replayed and integrated when the pupil is dilated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like new learning, old knowledge, new learning, old knowledge, and that is fluctuating slowly throughout the sleep,” Oliva said. “We are proposing that the brain has this intermediate timescale that separates the new learning from the old knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that pupil tracking during sleep is a noninvasive procedure opens up applications for further study in humans, Oliva said, and could be particularly beneficial for people who have memory deficits associated with mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits even extend beyond humans, into the realm of machine learning, which is woefully cumbersome when compared to the efficiency of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain can remember a lot of things with a relatively small number of neurons, and how that happens is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How can the brain achieve such a huge feat of memory and cognitive skills with so little resources compared to ChatGPT, which consumes hundreds of thousands of times more energy to do any task?” Fernandez-Ruiz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This way of dividing, in time, two key functions of memory is what underlies the huge scope of biological brains for having such amazing memory capacities with relatively low resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides a new opportunity to train artificial neural networks to be more efficient, perhaps, by being more similar to how actual brains work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Annabella Wulf ’24, Thokozile Nyasulu ’24 and Madison Wolf ’25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the

memories are reactivated in the hippocampus during sleep, an initial step for their consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is concomitant with the hippocampal reactivation of previous memories, posing the problem of how to prevent interference between older and recent, initially labile, memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical work has suggested that consolidating multiple memories while minimizing interference can be achieved by randomly interleaving their reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative is that a temporal microstructure of sleep can promote the reactivation of different types of memories during specific substrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, to test these two hypotheses, we developed a method to simultaneously record large hippocampal ensembles and monitor sleep dynamics through pupillometry in naturally sleeping mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscillatory pupil fluctuations revealed a previously unknown microstructure of non-REM sleep-associated memory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that memory replay of recent experiences dominated in sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil substates of non-REM sleep, whereas replay of previous memories preferentially occurred during dilated pupil substrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective closed-loop disruption of sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil non-REM sleep impaired the recall of recent memories, whereas the same manipulation during dilated pupil substates had no behavioural effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger extrinsic excitatory inputs characterized the contracted pupil substate, whereas higher recruitment of local inhibition was prominent during dilated pupil substrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the microstructure of non-REM sleep organizes memory replay, with previous versus new memories being temporally segregated in different substates and supported by local and input-driven mechanisms, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the brain can multiplex distinct cognitive processes during sleep to facilitate continuous learning without interference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Remember when we thought &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2024/12/31/dementia-caregivers-love-and-resilience/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; was just something that happened to old people? Well, science just dropped a major plot twist. A new study published in The Lancet reveals that two surprisingly common health issues could be threatening your brain health right now. The first bombshell is that high &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/about/ldl-and-hdl-cholesterol-and-triglycerides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in midlife accounts for about 7% of dementia cases, while untreated vision problems are responsible for 2% of cases later in life. But wait, there’s more. These two newcomers join a lineup of twelve other factors scientists already knew about, including skipping workouts, smoking, excessive drinking, breathing polluted air, head injuries, social isolation, limited education, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, and hearing problems. Together, they’re like a wrecking ball to your &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2024/12/31/antibiotics-study-dementia-risk-seniors/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The math that will blow your mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Here’s the tea, if we tackle all fourteen of these factors head-on, we could potentially prevent or delay up to 45% of dementia cases. That’s not just a statistic, that’s literally millions of people keeping their memories intact. Currently, about 6.7 million Americans over 65 are living with dementia, and by 2060, that number could hit 13.8 million. We’re not trying to scare you, but actually, yes we are, because this is serious business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why your eyes are secretly controlling your brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Think your vision problems are just about not being able to read the menu at that dimly lit restaurant? Think again. When you can’t see properly, your brain goes into a kind of hibernation mode. You stop engaging with the world around you, skip social activities, and basically put your brain on airplane mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The solution that’s literally right in front of your face&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="-mt-1 [li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;]:mt-2 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-8"&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Get your eyes checked regularly. Like, seriously, stop putting it off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Actually wear your glasses instead of squinting at everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Consider surgery if your doctor recommends it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Monitor your cholesterol levels like you stalk your ex on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Make friends with vegetables and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Move your body more than just walking to the fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Talk to your doctor about medication if lifestyle changes aren’t cutting it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The cholesterol connection you never saw coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Your brain is literally obsessed with blood flow, and high LDL cholesterol is that toxic friend who keeps messing things up. When your blood vessels get clogged with fatty deposits, your brain cells start gasping for oxygen like you after running for the bus. Making friends with vegetables and whole grains, moving your body more than just walking to the fridge, and talking to your doctor about medication if lifestyle changes aren’t cutting it are crucial steps in protecting your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why this matters more than your social media feed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Your brain health isn’t just about remembering where you put your keys. It’s about maintaining your independence, keeping your personality intact, and not forcing your kids to become your caretakers before they’re ready to handle that responsibility. The research team behind this study isn’t just throwing around theories. They’ve done the work, crunched the numbers, and come to a pretty epic conclusion, you have way more control over your brain’s future than you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-600 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The reality check you didn’t ask for but totally need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Making these changes isn’t as easy as double-tapping an Instagram post. It requires actual effort and commitment, but compared to the alternative of dementia, isn’t it worth giving it a shot? Schedule that eye exam you’ve been putting off, get your cholesterol checked, and start making those lifestyle changes we talked about. Your brain’s future is literally in your hands right now. You can either keep pretending these risk factors don’t matter, or you can start making changes that could literally save your mind. And honestly, what’s more important than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Remember, while we can’t control everything about our brain health, these fourteen factors are totally within our power to change. So maybe it’s time to stop doom-scrolling and start doing something about it. Your future self will thank you, assuming they can remember to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="199" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z2ok001f3b716tcczf74@published"&gt;I’m a 75-year-old male who married the love of my life four years ago. My problem is that for at least the past two years, I’ve had a difficult time coming. I have no trouble getting an erection and can go for a long time, but I often just can’t seem to “get there.” It doesn’t matter if it’s PIV, oral, or masturbation. I can’t remember the last time I came from a blow job. I do have orgasms, but they’re infrequent. And it often takes 45 minutes of various stimulation to finally climax. I’m not on SSRIs and haven’t been since 2021. My penis just doesn’t seem to be as sensitive as before. My wife is incredibly attractive, so it isn’t that. When we have sex, most of my pleasure comes from pleasuring her. We have sex usually three times a day, almost every day. We love it. I just wish I could come more easily. Not every time—I know better than that. But twice a week would be nice, especially if it didn’t take forever. I’ve already been checked by a urologist and don’t have any obvious deficiencies. I’m at a loss as to what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z2zc001i3b71pmumubxe@published"&gt;What you describe sounds like a condition often referred to as delayed orgasm, which is notoriously difficult to treat. (Definitions and terminology vary; others might call what you are experiencing &lt;em&gt;delayed ejaculation&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;anorgasmia&lt;/em&gt;, a term that generally refers to an absence of orgasm but &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24640-anorgasmia"&gt;sometimes is used&lt;/a&gt; for orgasms that are “delayed, infrequent, or [lacking] intensity despite being aroused.”) A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-023-00692-7"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the International Journal of Impotence Research that reviewed the literature on DO broke down the common causes for the condition like so: SSRIs (42 percent), psychogenic (28 percent), low testosterone (21 percent), abnormal penile sensation (7 percent), and penile hyperstimulation (2 percent). I recommend reading that paper, as it’s teeming with useful information and may actually provide some hope.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z333001j3b7187t66wqh@published"&gt;Though DO is hard to treat, it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. “Common treatments plans are often multidisciplinary and may include adjustment of offending medications and sex therapy,” report the paper’s authors. You mention that your levels were checked, by which I’m sure you’re referring to your testosterone. You might want to make double sure that your thyroid-stimulating hormone levels have been checked as well, as the paper reports that hypothyroid patients often experience DO.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z36l001k3b71k9c21p9u@published"&gt;Causes of psychogenic DO can include “feelings of fear, anxiety, hostility, relationship difficulties associated with sexual intercourse and encounters,” while common triggers include “childhood sexual abuse, sexual trauma, repressive sexual education or religious beliefs, general anxiety, and history of being widowed or divorced.” If any of this stuff resonates with you, working through it in therapy should be your priority. Hyperstimulation of the penis is another factor, as DO is “significantly associated” with higher masturbatory activity, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z3a7001l3b7129qbn2hh@published"&gt;The treatment approach will depend on the source of the DO, and may be multipronged, including medical interventions and sex therapy. The latter “involves enhancing psychological arousal by using a vibrator or vigorous pelvic thrusting and addressing psychological factors that may be contributing to DO.” If there is decreased penile sensation (which additional tests may elucidate—you might want to ask your urologist about biothesiometry or pudendal somatosensory-evoked potential, since you mention that your penis “doesn’t seem to be as sensitive as before”), penile vibratory stimulation, in which a vibrator is placed on the frenulum of the penis for up to 10 minutes, may be useful. The authors cite a small &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382163/"&gt;study from 2006&lt;/a&gt; that found that 72 percent of men who were classified as anorgasmic and underwent PVS had a restoration of orgasm on at least some occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z3di001m3b71ytbim6m0@published"&gt;A therapist might also direct you to things like “erogenous zone stimulation, altering pressure and pace of penile stimulatory techniques, using vibrators, or incorporating roleplay.” You might too consider changing up your sexual practices/positions to maximize pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z3h6001n3b71y5tl7e5r@published"&gt;In terms of medication, there are no FDA-approved drugs for DO, but some drugs for other uses have shown promise, namely cabergoline, bupropion, oxytocin, and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall). You can talk to your urologist about off-label prescriptions if this is a road you want to go down, though be aware that they may come with side effects, particularly because they’ve all been formulated to treat other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z3ki001o3b71tze9n8tr@published"&gt;So, treating this is something that may require a lot of trial and error. I’m going to suggest taking the pressure off yourself entirely. Don’t worry that it’s taking you 45 minutes to come—enjoy that time. Also keep in mind that you are, by any measure, extremely sexually active. Three times a day, almost every day, means you’re putting the “busy” in &lt;em&gt;getting busy&lt;/em&gt;. It sounds as if you might already be doing some version of this, but maybe if you shift your priorities to edging the majority of the time (that is, stimulating your penis without the intention of orgasm), you might build up more excitement so that in a few sessions, orgasm is more easily achieved. That’s something you can toy with now, before pursuing further medical or therapeutic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h4z3o8001p3b71gmxxe9ym@published"&gt;If that doesn’t work, maybe try no stimulation of your penis for a period of time (maybe a few days to a week), in case a contributing factor is hyperstimulation. I’m not saying to have less sex, just to focus entirely on her—or parts of your body beyond your dick—and see if that moves the needle. Regardless, look: You’re having oodles of sex with the love of your life. You have learned to get pleasure through giving it. “We love it,” you report. If nothing ever improves with your orgasmic functioning, you still have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to be grateful for sexually. Cherish that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500lk00283b71ntc91q68@published"&gt;I’m a bi male and have two questions about Grindr, hookup apps, and sexual health. I am a super horny guy, and 90 percent of the time, I engage in bareback sex. However despite my high risk tendencies, I still want to stay healthy. I get tested usually around every 6 weeks and I take PrEP and Doxy PEP.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500lk00293b71t3e704ej@published"&gt;Having said all this, there are two groups of guys that I’m debating whether to engage with: (1) HIV undetectable and (2) guys who say they want me to poop on them or guys who are eager to suck my bareback dick after it’s been inside a dirty hole. FYI, I’m cool with fucking bottoms who don’t clean out. Sex is sometimes messy and spontaneous, and I just roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500lk002a3b71bu87vuw5@published"&gt;My real questions are about the health concerns both for myself and the bottom. As far as I can tell from my STI doctor and ChatGPT, bareback sex between someone who’s HIV undetectable and someone on PreP should have effectively zero risk, right? I’d still like to ask you because I admire the extensive research that goes into your answers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500lk002b3b71hquz4hsf@published"&gt;And regarding the guys who are into poop, what’s the health risk both to myself and them? Part of my hangup is that I’m not comfortable with being responsible for a bottom who enjoys getting fecal matter in their mouth. They insist it’s perfectly healthy, but how could it be? I respect their kinks—and the simple answer obviously is for me to just fuck someone else—but some of these bottoms are seriously hot and the submissive aspect also appeals to me as a top. Do you have any thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500ll002e3b71oe6uy87g@published"&gt;You are right—having sex with an undetectable partner while you fully adhere to your PrEP regimen, as prescribed, comes with virtually zero risk for contracting HIV. The great thing about PrEP is that it’s about 99 percent effective (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stophivtogether/hiv-prevention/prep.html"&gt;says the CDC&lt;/a&gt;) regardless of your partner’s status/viral load. That alone should instill confidence. But yes, adding on top of that a partner’s suppressed viral load means the chances of HIV transmission are as close to nil as it gets (while still leaving a margin for the extremely unlikely).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500ll002f3b71l521edny@published"&gt;What gave me full faith in &lt;a href="https://preventionaccess.com/"&gt;U=U&lt;/a&gt; (undetectable equals untransmittable) was robust data deriving from the PARTNER study. The &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2014/no-one-undetectable-viral-load-gay-or-heterosexual-transmits-hiv-first-two-years"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of that two-year study found that, among its hundreds of participating mixed-status couples—who had more than 44,000 combined instances of sex—there were no transmissions of HIV from the undetectable HIV-positive partner to the HIV-negative one. A &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; of only gay couples who logged even more sex acts found the same thing. Antiretrovirals work. However, not everyone who is HIV positive maintains consistent blood levels (for example, HIV can go from undetectable to detectable), which is why PrEP is a great additional layer to one’s sexual health regimen. It’s like wearing two condoms but it actually works and doesn’t actually involve wearing condoms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500ll002g3b71ihizcj0g@published"&gt;Regarding your other query, I think it’s important to distinguish between eating poop and engaging in ass-to-mouth. There’s a difference between being OK with getting some fecal matter in one’s mouth and chowing down. I realize there’s a spectrum, and that a lack of douching can really change the color (and flavor) here, but while ass-to-mouth carries some risk, it’s relatively small according to a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-dirty-is-going-ass-to-mouth/"&gt;VICE exploration of this matter&lt;/a&gt;. According to one epidemiologist, “the transfer in the same body of NORMAL enteric (intestinal) pathogens—those that cause gastroenteritis—we wouldn’t expect to see an increase in risk. If you have enterohemorrhagic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; (that’s &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that can cause diarrhea or coliti) or &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt; (a type of bacteria that causes food poisoning) in your gut, adding some more at the top end doesn’t noticeably change things in the alimentary canal.” Note “same body” in that quote—the risk goes up if the dick in your mouth is coming from someone else’s ass. Norovirus, which is &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2024/12/31/health/norovirus-cases-increase-wellness/index.html"&gt;surging right now&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html"&gt;spread via feces&lt;/a&gt;, which heightens the stakes for rimming and ass-to-mouth, at least for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="193" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm5h500ll002h3b71ncodooqh@published"&gt;To be clear, &lt;a href="https://www.poison.org/articles/feces"&gt;bacteria, viruses, and parasites&lt;/a&gt; are found in poop. There are a number of &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/diarrheal-infections.page"&gt;diarrheal infections&lt;/a&gt; that are somewhat common in men who have sex with men. To say that play that involves various configurations of asses and mouths is “perfectly healthy” is a stretch, and the more poop you ingest, the bigger risk you take. However, given our cultural taboos about eating poop, said risk is widely understood and it’s safe to assume that someone who engages in this behavior is aware of this. If someone wants to suck your dick after it came out of his butt, you don’t need to stop everything to deliver a teachable moment. It’s really not your responsibility to school people on the obvious. You have to decide whether it’s more important to overlook this for the sake of banging a seriously hot dude, or to move on to a seriously hot dude who isn’t into this thing that makes you somewhat uneasy. There are a lot of seriously hot dudes and it’s widely accepted within gay culture that there’s a shortage of tops, so it sounds like you can really have your pick.&lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago they found prostate cancer and I had a full prostatectomy. The cancer is gone (yay) but I’m dealing with the aftermath of ED (I’m on Cialis but it doesn’t work). I miss the splooge more than I ever thought. In the “God laughs” category, I have suddenly been presented with multiple guys a month (always younger) who try to get me into the sack. (I’m not on the apps.) That’s not something I’m used to, but I am horny all the time. I have dry orgasms and fun new mini orgasms if a guy really gets me turned on with kissing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

My medical history (beyond HIV status) is a lot to unload for a hookup. Do I owe guys a heads up before they commit? The ED could resolve itself in 1-2 years but that seems like forever.&lt;/p&gt;

Given your situation and that you’re asking this question at all, I’m assuming that you’re bottoming/sucking. If that’s the case, and there’s no expectation of your erection making or breaking the session ahead of time, I don’t think you need to reveal this upfront. There’s no guarantee a bottom will stay hard during penetration (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/19exqti/how_to_stay_hard_when_bottoming/"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/5oldo6/serious_how_do_you_stay_hard_while_bottoming/"&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/75jhc5/do_you_stay_hard_when_bottoming/"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/lm9p72/is_it_normal_for_it_to_be_difficult_to_stay_hard/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1g1m9bo/question_for_the_bottoms_how_many_of_you_stay/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1cq7xdh/for_guys_who_bottom_how_many_of_you_stay_hard/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/1fyp5ym/bottoms_out_there_how_likely_is_it_that_you_get/"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ew9wmv/hard_or_soft_when_bottoming/"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1g2bbj9/heres_the_poll_bottoms_do_you_stay_hard_or_go/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/rj7fdk/so_how_normal_is_it_for_the_bottom_to_get_hard/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). Guys who are experienced at topping know that a bottom may or may not be hard while getting plowed, but as long as he’s having fun, that’s really all that matters. You may encounter guys who get really turned on by bottoms with hard dicks, but if that’s their thing, the onus is on them to state it ahead of time and make sure you are carrying the kind of wood they’re looking for. (If I’ve misread you and you are actually being approached to top or get head, absolutely share this information upfront with whatever alternatives to a hard dick you will provide–i.e. toys/a strap-on or assurances that you enjoy getting sucked while soft.)&lt;/p&gt;

While I don’t imagine your limp dick would be a deal breaker to most seasoned tops, it might be and you’ve been through enough to not be stigmatized for something that is virtually cosmetic. Of course, not disclosing ahead of time means you may be asked about your plumbing in the moment. As long as you don’t find that too awkward, this is something that’s worth reserving as a topic of discussion until it comes up (and hopefully a brief, “I had a procedure recently,” will suffice for your hook-up). You could also try experimenting with a chastity cage, which could take some pressure off as it may be harder to determine whether you’re erect or not while wearing one. It could be something to lean into, in fact, if you’re at all submissive or kinky.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s what the research found, plus what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;The study, which was recently published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2024/11/07/bjsports-2024-108748" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Journal of Sports Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; analyzed data from 20 studies of nearly 400,000 people where a person’s cardiovascular fitness was compared to their BMI. (The researchers measured fitness with a VO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;peak exercise test—more on that in a second.) The scientists also looked at the study participants’ risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Researchers discovered that people who had overweight or obesity but were fit didn’t have a statistically significant higher risk of dying or developing heart disease. But people who were not fit had a two- to three-times greater risk of dying, regardless of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“From a health perspective, the risks of being unfit are far worse than the risks associated with carrying extra weight,” lead author &lt;a href="https://education.virginia.edu/about/directory/siddhartha-angadi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Siddhartha Angadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Siddhartha Angadi&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Virginia, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/health-injuries/a63160618/vo2-max-better-marker-of-health-than-bmi-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Runner's World;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Runner's World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “This study builds on a large body of research over the past three decades that underscores the importance of fitness over fatness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;In an ideal world, doctors would gauge health risks by measuring exercise capacity, Angadi added, noting that it should be considered a “vital sign” like &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g43866766/best-blood-pressure-monitors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, pulse rate, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is VO2 max?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/sports-medicine/resources/vo2description" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; is a measure of how much oxygen your body absorbs and uses while you work out. (V stands for “volume” while “O2” is for oxygen.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is BMI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;BMI stands for body mass index. It’s a calculation of your height relatively to your weight, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bmi/adult-calculator/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). BMI is generally classified into underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity—although obesity is subdivided into three classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;BMI has received a lot of criticism over the past few years. In fact, the American Medical Association &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-policy-clarifying-role-bmi-measure-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; BMI an “imperfect way to measure body fat in multiple groups, given that it does not account for differences across race/ethnic groups, sexes, genders, and age-span.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;A person who has a lot of muscle may be classified as obese under BMI measurements, for example, simply because this calculation only relies on height and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I measure my VO2 max?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Unfortunately, VO2 max isn’t an easy thing to calculate on your own. It usually requires undergoing a cardiopulmonary exercise test at your doctor’s office or at an exercise medicine lab, where you wear a mask over your face to record your oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while running on a treadmill, riding a bike, or doing something similar, according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;That said, some &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workout-clothes-gear/g35553275/best-fitness-trackers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fitness trackers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; can estimate your VO2 max based on your pace and heart rate (although this is just an estimate—not actual results).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;If you're concerned about your overall fitness and its impact on your health, check in with a medical professional.

The most popular group of antidepressant medications promotes the absorption of serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in December in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776224002606#sec3"&gt;The Lancet Regional Health - Europe&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 25,729 colorectal cancer patients, five percent of whom were under 50 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were 31 to 80 years old and had been diagnosed at stages one, two, or three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 68, and 56 percent of patients were men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients (40 percent) had stage two cancer, while 36 percent were stage three and 23 percent were stage one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were divided into three groups based on when they had surgery to remove their tumors: 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers followed them for six months after surgery until they either had a relapse, died from the disease, were diagnosed with another form of cancer, moved to another country, or went five years without a recurrence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients under 50 had a 29 percent recurrence rate over five years compared to 21 percent for the older group - a 28 percent heightened risk their disease would come back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, younger participants had a recurrence after an average of 14.5 months compared to 17.5 months for older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rate at which younger people with colon cancer suffer recurrences (blue), other types of cancer (red) and death (green) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rate at which older people with colon cancer suffer recurrences (blue), other types of cancer (red) and deaths (green) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphs show the increased risk of recurrence in younger patients six (left) and 12 months (right) after surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients under 40 had the highest relapse rate, at 31 percent over five years. The relapse rate for people 40 to 49 years old was 28 percent, and patients ages 50 to 59 had a 23 percent recurrence rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts suggested this could be because patients under 40 are considered too young to qualify for regular colon cancer screening - such as a colonoscopy - leading them to not receive a diagnosis until their cancer becomes severe enough to cause symptoms and spread throughout their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other recent research suggests diets high in ultra-processed foods, which have become more prevalent over recent decades, could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies estimate 70 percent of Americans' diets are now &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7499305/US-diets-improved-Americans-eat-sugar-fat-study-finds.html"&gt;made up of processed foods and ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers of the 2024 study also found younger patients with cancer tended to have more frequent follow-up scans following their diagnosis, which could have led to tumors being spotted earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger patients were, however, more likely to survive their diagnosis than older patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those in the early-onset relapse group, 39 percent died within five years compared to 55 percent of relapse patients over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to younger patients being less likely to have other pre-existing conditions like obesity and high blood pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raquel (left) was 28 when doctors diagnosed her with stage four colon cancer. Evan White (right) was diagnosed with colon cancer at 24. He died four years later, just weeks before his wedding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authors acknowledged several limitations to the research, such as excluding patients over 80 and those with previous cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who relapsed within six months of surgery were also not included, as the researchers wanted to wait for patients to stop their primary treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said: 'Our study suggests that early-onset CRC patients had a higher risk of recurrence compared to late-onset CRC from 2004 to 2019 for all disease stages indicating that delayed diagnosis is not the sole explanation for the higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nevertheless, an increased awareness towards early-onset CRC in general practice and by gastroenterologists may still promote earlier diagnosis and prognosis in these patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;has the sixth highest rate of early-onset cancers, with 87 cases per 100,000 people under 50, and colon cancer is among the fastest rising.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers from the University of Missouri-Kansas City recently looked at rates of colorectal cancer in people 10 to 44 years old over the last two decades and found cases had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13400067/colorectal-tumors-surge-younger-ages.html"&gt;risen in all age groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett, from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rate of colorectal cancers grew 500 percent among children ages 10 to 14 and 333 percent among teenagers aged 15 to 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates rose by 71 percent among people 30 to 34 to seven cases per 100,000 people. Among people 35 to 39, rates rose by 58 percent to 12 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many young patients have their symptoms dismissed for more benign gastrointestinal conditions, leading to a more aggressive disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com has repeatedly documented the global rise of colon cancer among young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Raquel, from California, was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13593835/symptoms-ignored-terminal-colon-cancer.html"&gt;diagnosed with stage four colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at just 28 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had suffered severe diarrhea off and on for three years that included blood in her stool. Yet doctors referred her to a psychologist instead of ordering additional tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Evan White, 24, from Dallas, had just graduated from the University of &lt;a href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-25bc3fe0-5ef4-11ef-a531-676fea43b109" target="_self" class=""&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; with a degree in finance when &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12211525/The-victims-Americas-epidemic-colon-cancers-young-people.html"&gt;he was diagnosed with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; after dismissing his main symptom - tiredness - for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was not spotted until it had progressed to stage three, meaning it had spread outside the colon, making it much harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died at age 29, just before his wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He aspires to tech-titan standards: “Mark Zuckerberg locked himself in a room until Facebook hit at least 100 million users,” he says with admiration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters has other, more personal reasons for his crusade against canola. At 26, after building and selling his first company, he developed Crohn’s disease and endured multiple intestinal surgeries and four months in intensive care. When he exited, he was intent on living differently — if obsessively. He speaks of nanoplastics and nutrient density. He eats a lot of organ meats, like beef heart. He just did a &lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/10/05/plasma-exchange-longevity-treatment/"&gt;therapeutic plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 29, he has a long way to go with this regimen. But, in his preppy, plaid-lined jacket and white polo, he presents as more mild-mannered than manic. “In high-grade empowerment, you can develop an overoptimization neurosis, but you can also be stoic and control what you can control. Some people choose ignorance, which can be bliss. [Superpower] is trying to educate people to make decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would think one decision would be to just stay home and cook with whatever oil you prefer. Maybe steam everything. But Peters enjoys dining out like most people do — for dates, meetings, and other social purposes. (For those times when he does eat at home, he pays a personal chef to prepare food for him.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanning the menu at Fang, Peters gets ready to order. He takes out a little plastic card he fashioned for Superpower’s subscribers. “Dear chef, I have a sensitivity to vegetable oils (aka seed oils),” it reads. “Please substitute them with the following fats or suggest a different dish.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is followed by a list of what is approved (butter, ghee, extra-virgin olive oil, coconut oil, duck fat, beef tallow) and what is to be avoided (canola, sunflower, safflower, peanut, corn, soybean, rice bran, grapeseed, or sesame oils, olive oil blends, and margarine). In case this comes off as presumptuous, the other side of the card politely adds, “Thank you for keeping me healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handed this unusual card, our server sends over the owner of the restaurant, Kathy Fang, who explains that most of the dishes are made with soybean oil. Peters looks at her sanguinely and asks if she’d mind cooking his lunch using the beef tallow he’s brought with him. Fang, a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.kathyfang.com/restaurants"&gt;House of Nanking&lt;/a&gt; family, doesn’t miss a beat. She smiles — maybe a little tightly — and graciously heads to the kitchen, jar in hand. Peters looks relieved. “I’ve been kicked out of a restaurant for asking to do that,” he says. “They said it was a safety violation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few minutes later, a stir-fry of green beans and a plate of Sichuan noodles with chicken are set down. Both dishes are extra greasy, but Peters seems happy enough. Twirling up the noodles with a fork he takes a bite. “It’s hard to say, but I think I can taste the tallow,” he says. “Psychologically, I feel better eating this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The San Francisco Standard</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1LdWFBa244ZFdTZVVnQzJlakhvZGd6QXVlVUlyenVDNDl0ZXdHekVMZWlzcGRGRlFFV1pERG9jTFYxbEIyUE0yTEZqV0VQRmhNTmE3WlZqS1JsMVdWUVRkWVA4LUk3VkdK</guid></item><item><title>Preserving muscle with GLP-1 weight loss drugs: Big deal or nothing to worry about? - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdm9fZ2NOaXBBbmY0N1l3NEIxbTFsNU9vM3dVdVhGOFIycnBSS0dUS05QdU8wdUpid1NGU01CLUJwVldVMjhWT3VtMDBzQTR6ZnZPbGNLMmR6dFQyaWhRamtoX2EzYXJ5WG9wQXBwUmRIUy11YnBwYmcweEdiSDNFMDZGd2RlSldJV1QyaXJJcTBhSlcwYkE0cU1vUHBvNk92OXlPbTNFb0tXQlVzVEw5MnJfdUlUYVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the surface, the formula for weight loss seems simple: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqac031"&gt;eat less and move more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But giving that advice to someone with obesity is like telling someone with depression to cheer up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-01106-8"&gt;Weight loss isn’t easy&lt;/a&gt;, or we wouldn’t be facing a crisis in overweight and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biology drives us to eat more food when it’s available, and our bodies have helped prepare us for times when we can’t find food by storing excess energy as fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, inexpensive, calorie-rich food is more abundant than in our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-071811-150711"&gt;hunter-gatherer past&lt;/a&gt;, and many of us consume as many calories as we like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the fat that may have once helped us to survive has now become a threat — one we are only beginning to manage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in food abundance has all happened in the last 100 years or so — an evolutionary blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Helpful medications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor antagonists like Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda or Zepbound may become as good as bariatric surgery at controlling weight long-term.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely humans will ever adapt for us not to gain weight, so when a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41569-023-00849-3"&gt;class of drugs&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to lose weight and keep it off, it’s a welcome and helpful development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we are now seeing several new iterations of the class of drugs known scientifically as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2019.09.010"&gt;Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1R) agonists (you may know them under such names as Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda or Zepbound), these types of drugs have actually been around for about 20 years, having started their useful life as treatments for Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine’s &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2023"&gt;breakthrough of the year in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs are an absolute revelation: they give you &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183"&gt;long-lasting weight loss&lt;/a&gt; as long as you &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14725"&gt;continue taking them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drugs aren’t quite as effective as bariatric surgery, but they’re &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23563"&gt;not far off&lt;/a&gt;, and they do the job without surgery. These drugs may become as good as bariatric surgery at controlling weight long-term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such drugs have proven to be so popular — even as injectables and at a price that makes them challenging &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/prices-of-expensive-diabetes-medicines-and-weight-loss-drugs-are-drastically-higher-than-production-costs/"&gt;for some users to afford&lt;/a&gt; — that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.q1448"&gt;there have been shortages&lt;/a&gt; as manufacturers try to expand production to meet &lt;a href="https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/news/glp-1-receptor-agonist-shortage-expected-to-continue-for-all-of-2024"&gt;growing demand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this, at least superficially, is welcome news since overweight and obesity increase the risk of many other health issues, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42542-9_1"&gt;certain cancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1520-037X.2003.01358.x"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People using these drugs are reporting not only losing weight but also having more energy and greater mobility, which, again, are welcome outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to exercise caution and prudence about what else this first generation of GLP-1R agonists might mean for our bodies over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fat loss and muscle loss&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing weight by dieting (restricting energy) includes, along with fat loss, losing lean mass, about half of which is typically muscle. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12143"&gt;general rule&lt;/a&gt; is that three-quarters of what we lose is fat and the rest is lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the positive health outcomes of maintaining muscle, especially as we age and become more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2023.101883"&gt;susceptible to sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;, the steady age-related loss of muscle mass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our research work, my colleagues and I use our findings to encourage everyone to exercise, and particularly to include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00645"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; — load-bearing exercise with the aim of gaining or at least maintaining muscle mass and strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing muscle can have a significant, direct effect on our quality of life. We need strength to reduce the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20064945"&gt;risk of falls&lt;/a&gt; and muscle to reduce the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00223-020-00742-y"&gt;risk of metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as Type 2 diabetes, which in older age can have severe outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while losing weight is an excellent way to improve our health, it should bear the caveat of not losing muscle, especially in older persons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise and protein&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Without deliberate efforts to exercise for strength and to increase protein intake to retain muscle, older adults in particular may experience muscle loss.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt this newly recognized class of weight-loss drugs is a watershed discovery and could improve lives for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as we see from early clinical trials, these drugs promote the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.15728"&gt;loss of lean mass&lt;/a&gt; together with the loss of fat, it will be important for users to be aware and for pharmaceutical companies to adjust future generations of these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without deliberate efforts to exercise for strength and to increase their protein intake to retain muscle, there could be consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body starts losing muscle after about age &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2012.00260"&gt;40 to 45&lt;/a&gt;. By the time we’re in our 60s, 70s and 80s, these losses are noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a hypothetical example featuring a 60-year-old person who is obese with 45 per cent body fat and weighs 100 kilograms (220 pounds). If that person loses 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in one year while taking a GLP-1R agonist — which is not unreasonable while taking such drugs — then somewhere between 2.5 and three kilograms (5.5 to 6.5 pounds) could be muscle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a loss may be consequential, especially when we consider that the same 60-year-old would lose, due to aging, about 0.3 kilograms (less than one pound) of muscle in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2018.07.005"&gt;one year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the good of the weight loss outweigh the “bad” of the muscle loss? It’s still too early to know if muscle loss while taking GLP-1R agonists will be problematic in the long run, but I think it’s important to proceed with caution, especially in older persons, until trial results are available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

that there is a real danger that routine procedures – from surgery to childbirth – could carry widespread life-threatening risks because of the spread of bacteria that possess &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/may/13/what-is-antimicrobial-resistance-and-how-big-a-problem-is-it-antibiotics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; (AMR). “About a million people die every year because of the spread of microbial resistance, and that figure will rise over the next 25 years,” she said. “It is really scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Estimates suggest that by 2050, death rates from AMRs will have doubled, with figures indicating almost 40 million people will lose their lives to superbugs over the next 25 years, with elderly people especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Recent data shows AMR is going down in the under-fives, which is good news. For the over-70s, mortality rates have gone up 80% since 1990; that is very concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;As the population ages, more people are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/21/number-of-people-with-chronic-pain-in-england-to-rise-by-19m-by-2040" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;living with chronic disease&lt;/a&gt; and that makes them more vulnerable to AMR, researchers have argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the face of these threats, doctors have tried to limit prescriptions of antibiotics as much as possible while patients have been pressed to complete courses of treatments. However, medical misuse of antibiotics is not the only route by which resistance spreads. The landscape itself plays a critical role, a problem that stems from the fact that about 70% of all antibiotics are given to livestock, creating a pool of animals in which resistance can evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re essentially throwing antibiotics at cows and chickens and sheep as cheap alternatives to giving them growth promoters or prophylactics to prevent the spread of disease,” said Davies. Such actions help microbes to evolve, so they develop the ability to ward off antibiotics, resistance that then spreads across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you’ve got intensive farming where a lot of antibiotics are used or a busy hospital that has a poor sewage system, resistant bacteria can get into waterways,” added Davies. “Winds blow over these patches of contaminated land or water and pick up bacteria and genes with resistance in them, then let them rain down in other places. That is how pernicious this problem has become.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The reason AMRs spread is a simple matter of the survival of the fittest, added Davies. “Bacteria take about 20 minutes to multiply. They also mutate a great deal, and if they do so in the presence of antibiotics and that mutation protects them, these strains will multiply. Crucially they can pass that on to any bacteria with which they make contact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The ease with which AMR spreads means it is becoming more and more important that we do not misuse the antibiotics we possess. It also generates a need for new antibiotics to be developed - and again this raise problems, said Davies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’ve had no new classes of antibiotics come into routine use since the late 80s and the market model that would promote the creation of new ones is broken. If you develop a new antibiotic, it might be used by someone for a weekly course once a year. Where’s the profit in that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“By contrast, blood pressure drugs that have to be taken every day, or cancer drugs that have to be administered for months, offer pharmaceuticals far greater profits. So there is no incentive for them to try to develop new antibiotics. It is a real headache.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The problems that lie ahead in dealing with AMR are not insurmountable, Davies insists, but they must be addressed with an increased sense of urgency. The G7 forum of industrialised nations has at least recognised the crisis. However, there is still a lack of adequate action and that needs to be tackled as an imperative in the coming year, she insists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxOamh4YS1pcl9fRmZieXcwRFVTVFEyc0h5WXY1RHpSSU9UWldvRmJnLTRMOExSTktSZFR3YlJWRGR5eUwxaXJ1WEJjZEtfa2czNnFEUkdIVE1BdlEzSXVIaHFseHFlVHZSN29xZ1BQTWUtbkdHVTltYS1KdzhyeTRiWkkyOU9sMGZYLW9VWndEeTNWSkV2NWp3b0hBRGpzOTVNUDFmNTBtU1owcGgxX00tTXpXVVo</guid></item><item><title>6 Heart-Healthy Foods You Should be Eating in January, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE84LUhSYnF3SEl6R1ZrSG5RMEM2amE2Qk0tdnNzUWQ5YXdEeVNESUR3TjJIX1ZXVkMtQkVraXQ3dFZGSlVEYTB0SW5rbV9haE5DY3dPT3YyQlphVFpueVktUldVVlFOQVl6Y1dmNktsV3BkVjl4WlltTk5GMEQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S. Yet, according to the American Heart Association, half of Americans are unaware of this sobering statistic.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is that a diet filled with heart-healthy foods can significantly reduce your risk of developing this all-too-common disease.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there are lots of foods that can improve heart health, sometimes you need a short list.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason why nutritionists are huge fans of seafood. Fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, sardines and canned tuna, contain heart-supporting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669415/signs-you-might-not-be-eating-enough-omega-3s/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. “Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure and decrease triglycerides, key ingredients for optimum cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burnout-Balance-Healing-Strategies-Immunity/dp/0593232429/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=from+burnout+to+balance&amp;amp;qid=1629831790&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-12" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Burnout to Balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; No wonder the AHA recommends eating at least two servings of fish weekly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re new to seafood, Bannan recommends rotating two varieties of fatty fish into your weekly meal plan. For a quick, flavorful dinner, she likes to bake salmon or mackerel with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of herbs. Never made mackerel before? Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250118/gochujang-glazed-grilled-mackerel/#:~:text=Mackerel%20is%20a%20fatty%20fish,and%20even%20protect%20the%20eyes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Gochujang-Glazed Grilled Mackerel&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding canned tuna to salads, wraps or a tuna melt is also an easy way to get your omega-3 fix, says Bannan. Or, when you have zero time, open a can of sardines to top crackers with a dollop of mustard for a simple snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/286364/5-reasons-to-love-dark-leafy-greens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; are another all-star filled with heart-supporting antioxidants and potassium, says Pittsburgh-based sports nutritionist &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., RDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Spinach, kale and Swiss chard are packed with potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure, and nitrates, which improve blood vessel function,” says Bannan. “They’re also rich in magnesium and fiber, both linked to improved heart health.” If that weren’t enough, leafy greens are packed with heart-supporting vitamins C and K. Plus, they’re low in calories and affordable.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can add more leafy greens to your plate by quickly sautéing them in olive oil and herbs for a simple side, says Bannan. She also loves tossing them into soups, casseroles, grain bowls or warm salads.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bannan and Bonci unanimously agree that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913519/what-are-legumes-are-they-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt; are nutritional powerhouses thanks to their cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber. They’re so powerful that one study found that people who regularly eat legumes are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Did we mention they also count as&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8020679/are-beans-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; a protein &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a vegetable&lt;/a&gt;? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you can always boil beans or lentils, nothing beats the speed and convenience of popping open a can of beans. These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dinner-casseroles-that-start-with-a-can-of-beans-8425165" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;16 Dinner Casseroles That Start with a Can of Beans&lt;/a&gt; can get you started.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not cooking with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292278/is-olive-oil-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; yet, here’s your invitation to start. This Mediterranean diet staple is high in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, which fight inflammation and lower LDL cholesterol, says Bannan. Research has found that diets rich in olive oil may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 16% and the risk of type 2 diabetes by 22%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Given olive oil’s versatility, you can enjoy it in a variety of ways. Try it as a “go-to base for&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7887765/healthy-salad-dressings-with-olive-oil/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; salad dressings&lt;/a&gt;, marinades and even drizzled over roasted vegetables,” suggests Bannan. “Or, during the colder months, as a finish in hearty soups and stews for added richness and heart-healthy benefits.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-soy-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Soy Foods  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8049006/health-benefits-of-edamame/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt; or soy milk, soy foods are a fantastic addition to your kitchen, thanks to their high-quality protein and heart-healthy isoflavones, says Bannan. Research agrees. For instance, one study found that people who ate soy foods, like tofu and natto, were less likely to develop cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. In fact, eating as little as 1 ounce of tofu daily lowered cardiovascular disease risk by 18%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re new to soy foods, you don’t have to go full-on vegan to reap their benefits. Ease your way in by swapping soy milk for dairy milk in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249315/banana-cocoa-soy-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, lattes or baked goods. Or, toss a cup of edamame into grain bowls, salads or this hearty &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249376/egyptian-edamame-stew/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Egyptian Edamame Stew&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7969228/is-soy-bad-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-whole-grains"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Whole Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been craving carbs, go ahead and dig in to foods made with 100% whole grains, says Bonci. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/a&gt; retain the grain’s nutritious bran, germ and endosperm. So, they’re loaded with fiber and antioxidants. This secret sauce of nutrients may help lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol and fight inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you have to choose one grain for your heart, make it &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. Oats are naturally rich in a magical cholesterol-lowering fiber called beta-glucan. In addition to taming cholesterol, research shows that oatmeal may help protect against stroke when substituted for white bread or eggs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Go ahead and spice up your next bowl with these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7828264/healthy-ways-to-make-oatmeal-taste-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;6 creative spins on oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritizing heart health not only reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes but also enhances overall quality of life,” says Bannan. “Simple, consistent lifestyle changes like incorporating heart-healthy foods, reducing stress, and regular movement can lead to significant long-term benefits.” These tips can get you started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move More&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporating and sticking to a regimen of regular movement improves blood flow, strengthens your heart (it’s a muscle!) and helps with weight control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Plant-Based Foods&lt;/strong&gt;: No need to avoid all animal proteins. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912945/this-kind-of-diet-could-lower-your-risk-of-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding more plants to your diet&lt;/a&gt; can have major heart-health benefits. For convenience, think canned beans, prewashed spinach, berries, and whole-grain bread, pasta and cereal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Mindfully&lt;/strong&gt;: Slowing down at meals and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating mindfully&lt;/a&gt; can help you tune in to your body’s innate hunger and fullness cues. This, in turn, may help you eat less, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy body weight, another key to heart health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The heart is literally the central processing unit of the body, so it’s smart to take care of it,” says Bonci. And the best place to start is in your kitchen. Strategically loading your fridge and pantry with fatty fish, leafy greens, legumes, olive oil, soy foods and 100% whole grains guarantees you’ll always have plenty of heart-healthy foods on hand. Of course, cardiovascular health isn’t just about what you eat. It’s also about lifestyle. So, slow down and enjoy your food, and make time for daily physical activity.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Feeling down? Taking a walk could help, new research shows.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The more steps we take, the less likely we are to feel depressed, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828073" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paper published in December.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed 33 studies examining the movements of nearly 100,000 adults using smartphones, pedometers and other fitness trackers. Those who clocked more daily steps were less likely to report depressive symptoms or be diagnosed with the condition than those who walked less.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's promising evidence that even small amounts of movement can add up to support better mental health," said Karmel Choi, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved with the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Participants ranged in age from 18 to 91 years old and lived in 13 different countries. Those who logged at least 5,000 or more daily steps were less likely to experience depressive symptoms, with the greatest effect coming for those who logged more than 7,500 steps a day — they were 42% less likely to suffer depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Studies like these are encouraging because they're not saying that you have to be a marathon runner or go to a really intense class, but you can accumulate the type of movement that's beneficial for your mental health in more gentle ways," said Choi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A subset of studies included in the meta-analysis found that for every 1,000 daily step increase, adults reduced their risk of developing depression by 9%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Setting goals for the number of daily steps may be a promising and inclusive public health strategy for the prevention of depression," the authors of the meta-analysis write. The study was led by Dr. Estela Jiménez López of the Health and Social Research Center at the University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The studies included in the new meta-analysis excluded people with depression at the time of enrollment and may not pertain to people already diagnosed with clinical depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, previous research has shown that exercise can reduce symptoms in adults with a diagnosis. A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/384/bmj-2023-075847.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, another medical research journal,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;showed that exercise reduced depression to the same extent as antidepressants, and in some cases, exercise worked better. However, for some people, medication, therapy or a mix of both are &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression" target="_blank"&gt;keys to managing depression.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges adults to get &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20is%20one%20of,muscle%2Dstrengthening%20activity%20each%20week." target="_blank"&gt;150 minutes a week&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity physical activity for both physical and mental health benefits. Some adults might have trouble keeping track of what counts as moderate exercise and how much time they spend doing it, Choi said. Tracking your daily steps with a smartphone or wearable device might be easier, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Choose the metrics that's most motivating for you," she advised. "It's not about putting step counts on a pedestal, but it's important to think of step counts as just one way to track movement."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Evan Brittain, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, finds fitness trackers useful in his cardiology practice because his patients tend to overestimate their physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These data are welcome because they start to put numbers that patients can understand to an important condition like depression," he said of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than 330 million people throughout the world suffer from depressive disorders, and a 2019 study showed that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr213.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; reported moderate or severe symptoms of depression in the previous two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prior research has consistently shown that physical activity can protect against the emergence of depression, the authors of the current study write.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm a strong advocate for physical activity in general for my patients," Brittain said. "I think it has lots of benefits for virtually every organ of the body, and that extends to mood conditions,"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brittain was not involved in the current research, but his &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671804/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study &lt;/a&gt;examining Fitbit data from more than 6,000 adults was included in the new meta-analysis. His research found that those who walked more than 8,200 steps a day lowered their risk of obesity, sleep apnea, reflux disease and major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The message is very consistent: more is better, and some is better than none," he said. "I advise all my patients that we're not asking you to run a marathon. Taking a walk is beneficial in itself."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Joint Expert Meeting on Microbiological Risk Assessment (JEMRA) report, which was published in December 2024, found that the human norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness. As the report stated, it came to this conclusion after conducting a "review of the viruses known to be associated with human foodborne illness. The frequency of illness, and the clinical severity of disease, as well as virus–food commodity pairs, were ranked in the context of foodborne illness." The review took a semi-quantitative approach, meaning it took into account both hard numbers as well as the "expert knowledge" of the authors of the report. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what foods were most likely to be associated with norovirus, the committee found it's usually prepared foods, frozen berries, and shellfish (ranked in order). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) explains that diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain are the most common symptoms of norovirus. However, fever, headache, and body aches can also be present. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Each year, norovirus is estimated to cause 125 million cases of foodborne illness and 35,000 deaths globally," the authors of the joint report added. According to the CDC, it causes 2,500 outbreaks in the U.S. alone, accounting for 58% of foodborne illnesses in the nation. "Norovirus is highly infectious, and outbreaks have been linked to foods with low levels of contamination. Viral contamination can occur across the whole food chain. Severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death, mainly affect children less than five years of age, the elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals who may shed the virus for extended periods of time." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Joining norovirus on a list nobody would want to be a part of is hepatitis A, which ranked second as the most viral. According to the report, it causes 14 million cases of foodborne illness a year and 28,000 deaths across the globe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There are significant regional differences in the proportion of hepatitis A cases that are attributed to food due to endemic prevalence and vaccine utilization," it added. "International trade of foods plays an important role in transmission to susceptible populations. Wider compliance with international standards, e.g., good agricultural and hygiene practices, is likely to reduce global transmission." The report added that it's most often associated with shellfish, frozen berries, and prepared foods as well (ranked in order). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And in third is the hepatitis E virus, which the report stated is "unique among the foodborne viruses" as it's "a zoonotic pathogen with many asymptomatic animal reservoirs, notably swine." It noted that there is no global estimation of cases attributed to food but that countries that have investigated its spread "found that their prior estimates are too low by one order of magnitude or more." Hepatitis E, the report added, can cause severe illness, especially in those with underlying health conditions, and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and neurological damage 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Undercooked pig products, including liver or raw sausage containing liver or blood, as well as liver pâté, are the main foods contaminated by hepatitis E virus," it warned. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Most Viral Foodborne Illnesses &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus&lt;/strong&gt;: 125 million cases and 35,000 deaths annually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis A&lt;/strong&gt;: 14 million cases and 28,000 deaths annually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis E&lt;/strong&gt;: 3.3 million cases and 44 000 deaths annually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, a number of other viruses, including astrovirus, sapovirus, enterovirus, enteric adenovirus, and rotavirus, could actually outnumber these. The team stated that there was a "lack of sufficient data to conduct a ranking of foods that may be contaminated" by these viruses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all of this is alarming, the authors also stated that improved surveillance data and better reporting of foodborne cases of these illnesses could help control or prevent their spread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The Expert Committee recommends that member countries consider capacity-building to support training and adoption of these methods for detecting viruses in foods and the environment," it concluded. "This approach has the potential to enhance knowledge on food attribution, support risk analysis, and reduce the burden of viral foodborne disease worldwide. Appropriate global actions will help alleviate the anticipated increase in public health risk from viral foodborne illness arising from population growth, the climate crisis, and globalization of food supply chains." And in the end, better training and detection could save millions of lives worldwide.

One way to start a streak effectively is to keep it simple. You may not have time to go for a daily 5-mile run, for example, but you can easily floss on the regular or start the day with a quick crossword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="col-body mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/man-bouncing-ball-dark-skin-tone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:⛹🏿‍♂️;cpos:36;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;⛹🏿‍♂️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Make exercise playful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Do you consider working out a slog?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Tulane University study suggests the Mediterranean diet's brain-boosting benefits may work by changing the balance of bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/29933935.2024.2439490" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Gut Microbes Reports&lt;/i&gt;, researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine found that subjects following a Mediterranean diet developed distinctly different gut bacteria patterns compared to those eating a typical Western diet. These bacterial changes correlated with better memory and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've known that what we eat affects brain function, but this study explores how that could be happening," said lead author Rebecca Solch-Ottaiano, Ph.D., neurology research instructor at Tulane's Clinical Neuroscience Research Center. "Our findings suggest that dietary choices can influence cognitive performance by reshaping the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that rats fed a Mediterranean-style diet rich in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/olive+oil/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, fish and fiber over 14 weeks showed increases in four beneficial types of gut bacteria and decreases in five others compared to rats eating a Western diet high in saturated fats. These bacterial changes were linked to improved performance on maze challenges designed to test memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, higher levels of bacteria such as Candidatus Saccharimonas were associated with better &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+performance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, while increased levels of other bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, correlated with poorer memory function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet group also showed better cognitive flexibility—the ability to adapt to new information—and improved working memory compared to the Western diet group. They maintained lower levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to assess the effects of the Mediterranean on microbiota and cognitive function outcomes relative to the Western diet in a rodent model. The researchers used young rats approximately equivalent in age to 18-year-old humans to model the effects of diet during a critical developmental period. The diets were based on human consumption and used ingredients reflecting the complexity of human diets. The Mediterranean diet (MeDi) showed clear benefits for cognitive flexibility, memory, and gut health, suggesting potential parallels in young adults whose brains and bodies are still maturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that the Mediterranean diet or its &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological effects&lt;/a&gt; could be harnessed to improve scholastic performance in adolescents, or work performance in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt;," said corresponding author Dr. Demetrius M. Maraganore, Herbert J. Harvey, Jr. Chair of Neurosciences. "While these findings are based on animal models, they echo human studies linking the Mediterranean diet to improved memory and reduced dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that larger human studies are needed to confirm these effects and better understand the complex relationship between diet, gut bacteria, and brain function in young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in following a Mediterranean eating pattern, key components include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olive oil as the primary fat source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abundant vegetables, fruits and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fish and lean proteins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited red meat and saturated fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High fiber intake from various plant sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By Allie Molinaro&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t already concerned about antibiotic resistance, it’s time to take notice. The UN recently issued a grave warning, &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/pga/78/2024/09/09/letter-from-president-of-the-general-assembly-on-amr-final-text-of-the-declaration/"&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt;  antimicrobial resistance (AMR) one of the most urgent global health threats. Known as the “silent pandemic,” antibiotic resistance &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01867-1/fulltext"&gt;claimed 4.7 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 alone. If left unchecked, that number could soar to 10 million per year by 2050—more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/sets/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-modelled-estimates"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; the global COVID-19 deaths in 2020. The projected AMR healthcare costs could surpass $1 trillion annually and up to $3.4 trillion in GDP losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that the primary cause of antibiotic resistance is human misuse. The quickest way to make a doctor or nurse’s blood pressure skyrocket is by telling them you didn’t finish your round of antibiotics. “You can’t do that!” they’ll exclaim, “That’s how you create SUPERBUGS!” They are right, of course, as exposing bacteria to antibiotics without killing all of them can cause the survivors to become resistant to the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But your decision to stop your 14-day prescription after 11 days is probably less apocalyptic than your doctor makes it out to be. While I don’t condone stopping antibiotics prematurely, that is not the main driver of antibiotic resistance.  In fact, most antibiotics aren’t even used on humans. About &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/david-wallinga-md/antibiotic-use-remains-far-too-intensive-us-livestock"&gt;two-thirds of all U.S. antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are used in the meat and poultry industry. And what would make any health professional scream even more is that most of these antibiotics are used on animals who aren’t sick. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 98 percent of animals raised for meat are &lt;a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Animal-Markets-and-Zoonotic-Disease-Risk-high-resolution.pdf"&gt;confined in industrialized systems&lt;/a&gt; that prioritize maximum output at the expense of animal health. Thousands (and often hundreds of thousands) of stressed and frustrated animals are crammed into poorly ventilated barns, standing in their own waste. Many often have lesions and open wounds, and standard practices often include &lt;a href="https://www.ciwf.com/farmed-animals/pigs/welfare-issues/?utm_campaign=antibiotics&amp;amp;utm_source=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=external&amp;amp;utm_term=AMR_oped"&gt;cutting off the animals’ tails&lt;/a&gt; or castrating them without proper treatment. Bodily fluids including urine, blood, and mucus mix among the crowded, immunosuppressed animals, creating a toxic soup of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses. Manure is kept in lagoons the size of football fields, creating more breeding grounds for disease. With animal health and welfare often ignored, routine antibiotics are used as a crutch to keep animals alive just long enough to reach slaughter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the FDA, the U.S. livestock industry &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/antimicrobial-resistance/2023-summary-report-antimicrobials-sold-or-distributed-use-food-producing-animals"&gt;purchased over 24 million pounds of antimicrobial drugs&lt;/a&gt; last year, over half of which are considered medically important. Despite public pressure campaigns to wean the livestock industry from its antibiotic addiction, the beef, turkey, and pork sectors have made little progress — even increasing their use in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consumers have tried to take matters into their own hands by opting for products with antibiotic-free labels. But, a recent USDA study sampling nearly 200 cattle carcasses across 34 states found that 20 percent of the samples in the “Raised Without Antibiotics” market &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/08/28/usda-releases-updated-guideline-strengthen-substantiation-animal"&gt;contained antibiotic residues&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, one-fifth of beef products with antibiotic-free labels may not be antibiotic-free at all.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surely the USDA will require testing after these findings, right? Wrong. Despite their own findings, the USDA’s recently updated labeling guidelines merely “recommend” that companies verify their antibiotic-free claims via testing. This level of oversight is about as reassuring as “recommending” toddlers to confess to stealing cookies from the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The USDA oversees approval of value-added claims on animal products, including “Raised Without Antibiotics” and “No Antibiotics Ever.” The agency undertook a multi-year effort to update its approval process, which prompted the study. But the new &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/documents/FSIS-GD-2024-0006.pdf"&gt;regulations&lt;/a&gt; are in many ways identical to the old ones, simply requiring companies who want to put such claims on their packaging to submit written descriptions of their operating procedures and only adding the recommendation to implement testing programs. The agency spent significant time and resources on the study and found deep flaws in their verification system, but their resulting regulation update is more of a pardon than a fix. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other regions have been more successful at ousting antibiotics from agriculture. In 2022, the European Union &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:4381220"&gt;banned the routine use of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; in farmed animals, cutting their &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2023/11/27/europe-livestock-food-antibiotics-antimicrobials-animals-fish-cattle-pigs-poultry/"&gt;use per animal in half&lt;/a&gt; compared to the U.S. Earlier this year, the United Kingdom also enacted a law &lt;a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/567/contents/made"&gt;banning the routine use of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; in farmed animals and prohibiting farmers from using antibiotics “to compensate for poor hygiene, inadequate animal husbandry, or poor farm management practices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The USDA’s toothless and apathetic response to antibiotic misuse and mislabeling is a slap in the face to our health professionals, UN leaders, and citizens. The USDA should be doing all it can to prevent a post-antibiotic era, and yet it will not even require testing measures in voluntary antibiotic claims. The agency’s inaction is also unfair to the farmers who genuinely adhere to antibiotic-free practices and rely on those claims to differentiate their products in the marketplace. With the USDA refusing to enforce rigorous testing standards in any capacity, the integrity of these labels and the public’s trust will crumble—and so will our health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what can we, as consumers, do to address this growing crisis? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Know your farmer.&lt;/strong&gt; As the USDA’s study proved, when it comes to antibiotic-free products, you don’t truly know what you are getting unless you get it from the source. Try to buy from local producers who you can ask directly about their practices. Cattle who are grazed 100 percent on pasture are also less likely to be given antibiotics for liver abscess prevention, a symptom of unnatural grain diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; 2. &lt;strong&gt;Eat less meat.&lt;/strong&gt; The only surefire way to reduce antibiotics from farmed animals is to reduce consumption of animal products. The U.S. eats &lt;a href="https://www.ciwf.com/research/more-money-more-meat/?utm_campaign=antibiotics&amp;amp;utm_source=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=external&amp;amp;utm_term=AMR_oped"&gt;more meat and poultry per capita&lt;/a&gt; than any other country in the world. To support healthier farming practices, we need to both lower our meat intake and transition to pasture-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Advocate for change.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask your representatives to &lt;a href="https://action.ciwf.com/page/122883/action/1?ea.tracking.id=article&amp;amp;supporter.appealCode=ET_US1024_C_050127&amp;amp;utm_campaign=antibiotics&amp;amp;utm_source=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=external"&gt;support federal bills&lt;/a&gt; such as the Farm System Reform Act and the Industrial Agriculture Conversion Act, which would provide farmers entrenched in industrialized methods with resources to transition to more sustainable farming operations that lessen the need for antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The era of unchecked antibiotic use in animal agriculture must come to an end. Without urgent reform, the future looks grim—a world where common infections become deadly again and cornerstones of modern medicine are erased by the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. But by making informed food choices and supporting systemic change, we can help steer the world toward a healthier, more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors said the winter illness season is returning to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO — The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; is reporting an increasing number of illnesses right now, from the flu and respiratory infections to whooping cough, RSV and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Saade is an attending physician at&lt;a href="https://www.sharp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; SHARP Hospital.&lt;/a&gt; He said the flu, &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/norovirus-back-full-force-cases-surge/507-836c1277-ed62-4887-9400-e8e9493c7227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;norovirus, known as the stomach bug&lt;/a&gt;, and respiratory illnesses are increasing in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost any virus, no matter where it kind of primarily infects you, is going to cause systemic symptoms, and those are going to be things like body aches, fevers and chills, and what we call malaise, which is like that low energy level," Saade said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saade said the annual flu season took a dip during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Five years later, it is picking up again.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So now what we're seeing more likely is a return to kind of typical pre-pandemic levels and patterns where these viruses are actually kind of where they're supposed to be and when they're supposed to be," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saade said by the end of February, most cases should begin to die down. If you do get sick, he recommends to rest and hydrate.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's just about getting rest, giving your body the time and resources it needs to heal, and just being a little patient," Saade said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't gotten sick, Saade said washing your hands is the best way to prevent catching something.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trying to work that routine or ritual into your day more frequently, such as when you enter or exit your home, or enter or exit a building," Saade said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get sick once, it doesn't mean you won't get it again. There's many different viruses spreading right now.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is actually pretty common for you to catch one virus, get sick from it, basically recover and then immediately fall into another viral infection," Saade said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble breathing, feel dehydrated or have any concerns, Saade said it's a good idea to seek medical attention. He said getting a&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-types/index.html?s_cid=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_F-FLU-VaccineTypes-Brd:fluarix:SEM00119&amp;amp;utm_id=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_F-FLU-VaccineTypes-Brd:fluarix:SEM00119&amp;amp;gad_source=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; flu shot&lt;/a&gt; is also a good way to prevent getting sick and recover faster.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

This is a higher number than the C.D.C. has recorded during the same week in recent years. It also exceeds the number of outbreaks recorded in early December in the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Outbreaks can occur throughout the year, but they are most common between November and April. The highly contagious virus, which sickens an estimated &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/norovirus#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20norovirus,of%20all%20foodborne%20disease%20outbreaks." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;19 to 21 million people nationwide each year&lt;/a&gt;, can cause sudden and unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In December, at least 80 people fell ill from norovirus linked to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/oysters-norovirus-los-angeles.html" title=""&gt;raw oysters&lt;/a&gt; served at a restaurant event in Los Angeles. The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;has advised&lt;/a&gt; people not to eat the oysters implicated in that outbreak, which came from British Columbia, Canada, and had been sold in 14 states and the District of Columbia before being recalled. Other recent recalls linked to norovirus have involved fresh and frozen berries, according to an &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm#tabNav_advancedSearch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;F.D.A. database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-2a50724f"&gt;How does norovirus spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said there are two characteristics that make norovirus “extraordinarily” contagious: It’s easily transmissible, and it’s hardy enough to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4624335/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;survive on surfaces&lt;/a&gt; for days or even weeks. A person can contract norovirus from contact with an infected person or from contaminated food, water or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Schaffner recalled a case in Tennessee in which a member of a bridge club became sick with norovirus and vomited in the parking lot. Everyone else at the table then became infected. He said that public health investigators later found norovirus on the playing cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A person sick with norovirus can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6003a1.htm#:~:text=16%2C40).-,Transmission,of%20feces%20during%20peak%20shedding." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;shed significant amounts&lt;/a&gt; of the virus, and it doesn’t take much to infect someone else. Because of this, the virus thrives in crowded, indoor spaces like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vessel-sanitation/cruise-ship-outbreaks/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cruise ships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5709813/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/outbreak-basics/index.html#:~:text=Schools%20and%20childcare%20centers,norovirus%20to%20spread%20in%20schools." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;schools and day care centers&lt;/a&gt;, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171d1bw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
