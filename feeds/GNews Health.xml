&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to what your body is telling you about your health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3s, like EPA and DHA, support brain health and cognitive function as you age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatty fish, chia seeds and walnuts provide omega-3s, but supplements may be needed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3s fight inflammation, aid memory and may lower Alzheimer’s risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you looking for ways to stay sharp as you get older? Maybe you've watched a loved one struggle with cognitive decline and want to avoid that. Or perhaps you simply want to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944120/best-exercises-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;be proactive&lt;/a&gt; for your brain health. No matter what the reason, we see you. And one of the best ways to do so is by incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's everything you need to know about omega-3s and brain health as you age.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in three main forms: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You need to consume these fats in your diet, as your body cannot make them in sufficient quantities on its own. Thankfully, seafood sources like salmon, fish oil and krill oil contain the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, while &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based sources&lt;/a&gt; like walnuts, flaxseed and chia seeds contain ALA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; have shown promise in multiple areas of wellness, which is why they continue to receive the spotlight. From promoting heart health to reducing inflammation, improving mental health, cognition and more, the benefits of these necessary fats are far-reaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-are-omega-3s-important-for-brain-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Are Omega-3s Important for Brain Health?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, two in three Americans will experience some level of cognitive decline by the age of 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the benefits omega-3s have shown so far regarding cognitive health, researchers are beginning to dive further into the effects this fat has on the aging brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before we dive into the science, here's a biology refresher. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are critical components of cell membranes—meaning they play an important role in keeping the brain functioning and facilitating communication between cells. Simply put, they are a big deal when it comes to cognitive health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/taylor-wallace" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Taylor Wallace, Ph.D., CFS, FACN,&lt;/a&gt; your body can produce around 10% of the amount of EPA and DHA you need from ALA that's consumed in your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, your body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA. However, as we age and with the onset of cognitive decline, this conversion rate starts to decline to less than 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In both animal and human studies, when the diet is void of omega-3 fatty acids, the levels of DHA, in particular, in the brain decrease, accelerating aging and affecting memory," says Wallace.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don't let this scare you, says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. By incorporating omega-3s into your diet—yes, even starting today—you can begin to reap the benefits well into your future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Omega-3s act as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. When we experience chronic inflammation in the body, cognitive health may decline, and age-related chronic disease conditions may increase. Adequate daily intakes of omega-3s have been shown to help to reduce inflammation in the body and thus protect against some age- and inflammatory-related conditions," says Davis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After evaluating the available data focusing on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diet-related disorders, one report concluded that EPA and DHA supplementation has a beneficial impact on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress and brain health outcomes, among other positive effects.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another review had similar results, finding a link between omega-3 supplement intake and improvements in learning, memory, overall cognitive health and blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of disease prevention, one study found that higher blood DHA levels were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia. Genetic factors also seemed to influence the benefits of DHA supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-omega-3-intake-recommendations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Omega-3 Intake Recommendations  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise consuming fatty fish, like salmon, at least twice a week. However, given that 90% of Americans don't come close to meeting their recommended intakes every week, it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consider a fish oil supplement&lt;/a&gt; to help fill in the gaps.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026238/plant-based-vs-vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian or vegan diet&lt;/a&gt; can get EPA and DHA from algal oil supplements, which are derived from marine microalgae—the food source that fish use to store up EPA and DHA omega-3s in themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's worth noting, though, that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most supplements are underregulated&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to choose one that has independent verification to ensure label accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both Wallace and Davis recommend a food-first approach for getting omega-3s but will recommend supplements when dietary intake is lacking as a practical way for people to meet their daily needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adequate intake recommendations for omega-3s haven't been updated in over 20 years. Keeping that in mind, the current guidelines recommend omega-3 intakes of 1.6 grams per day for men and 1.1 grams per day for women—but these numbers are reflective of ALA recommendations only. There are currently no U.S. government dietary recommendations for EPA and DHA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, the American Heart Association recommends at least 250 mg per day of DHA and EPA to prevent heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are critical for healthy aging and cognition. While more research is needed on the recommended amounts for optimum brain health benefits, no matter how old you are, you should consider upping your intake of DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids. It's never too late—or too early—to start!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can increase your intake by eating fatty fish such as salmon, sardines and herring at least twice a week and incorporating plant-based sources like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-8628392" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts and flaxseeds on a daily basis.

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to health news website &lt;em&gt;Healthshots&lt;/em&gt;, fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver, hindering its ability to function properly. A small amount of fat in the liver is normal, but when fat content exceeds 5% of the liver’s weight, it can lead to conditions such as cirrhosis, non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Those who are overweight or obese are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Fortunately, fatty liver disease is a reversible condition. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage and reduce the condition. Below are five fruits that may aid in combating fatty liver disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Grapefruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/5-fruits-that-support-liver-detoxification-4888511.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; may help repair liver damage caused by fatty liver disease and assist in detoxifying the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Additionally, rich in antioxidants like naringin and naringenin, grapefruit helps reduce inflammation and protect the liver, benefiting overall liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/red-green-or-yellow-which-apple-color-is-best-for-you-4880449.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Apples&lt;/a&gt; are high in soluble fiber, which aids in reducing liver fat and facilitates detoxification. The polyphenols found in apples also help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, promoting better liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Red and green apples.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Avocado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/is-freezing-avocados-a-good-way-to-preserve-them-4863703.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Avocados&lt;/a&gt; are rich in healthy fats and contain phenols, which may help lower blood lipids and prevent liver damage, particularly in those with NAFLD. A 2015 study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine reported that avocados might help lower the risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Papaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Papayas are packed with enzymes and vitamins that aid digestion and reduce the liver’s workload. By improving digestion, papaya allows the liver to function more efficiently and may help alleviate NAFLD, according to studies conducted on rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Kiwi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Kiwi is nutrient-dense and supports liver health with its powerful antioxidants. These antioxidants help prevent fatty liver diseases and protect the liver from damage, boosting overall liver function and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4888511,4888603,4887058,4889628,4889637,4890060" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was sideswiped by a car, then ran over by the truck behind while cycling to work. I was essentially impaled by my right femur, which shattered my pelvis and shoved bone fragments into my guts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last thing I remember before I got knocked out for surgery, was the surgeon telling me everything was going to be fine, and it was all routine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I didn't wake up for a month. When I did, I was missing the entire left leg, and most of the muscle tissue in the right. I was too weak to move much, couldn't talk because I had a tube through my neck, and I was very uncertain about reality due to what I went through in my coma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Parades of doctors came to tell me how I should be dead, and it's crazy that I lived. I was told over and over that my survival was very much against all odds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My surgeon on the other hand, never said anything like that. He always maintained that he was going to get me through. His attitude honestly helped when I had to go back to his table a few more times before I was done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For 4 years, I kind of blew off the people who made a big deal about my survival. I adopted my orthopedic doctors attitude. Then I met a woman who's in the medical field. I fell in love, and eventually trusted her enough to let her read my medical records. I had never read them, because it's a massive pile of paperwork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She broke down crying and couldn't read anymore. She told me that the beginning of my time in the hospital was full of the type of write-ups you find in the morgue. She told me that when they opened me up, bits of my pelvis fell out. I asked her to stop there. She won't read anymore, and I don't want to know anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I now know my doctor has one hell of a pokerface.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efayetj/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/usa-california-hawthorne-U73kZ5kDGCQ" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722455"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722455" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-1-682d98db2d69c-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image." title="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago my then 11 year old shattered both femurs and her hip. At the time, her Orthopaedic specialist was so reassuring and confident that we had no doubts about her recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, we went back for a review and he asked me if I'd like to see her trauma x-rays. Not having any idea of the reality I said yes. What I saw looked like her leg bones had exploded. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After my freaked out reaction I commented on how cool and calm he was, and how certain that she'd be fine. He said he'd actually had to go for a short walk around the hospital to collect his thoughts since he had no idea how he would put this child back together. He also told me had used the films as a teaching aid. He's one of my heroes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efacnxl/" target="_blank"&gt; MamaBear4485 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/doctor-is-checking-patient-x-ray-film-l8V9BP3qZjQ" target="_blank"&gt; Curated Lifestyle / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-1/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722456"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722456" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-2-682d994b224ae-png__700.jpg" alt="Dog illuminated in red light against a black background, symbolizing medical workers staying calm while witnessing the unbelievable." title="Dog illuminated in red light against a black background, symbolizing medical workers staying calm while witnessing the unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A dog bit my little sister in the face, ripping through her mouth and cheek. It was at a soccer game, she crawled on top of a big dog called a borzoi, which startled it, it rolled over and bit her in the face. This was the late 80's, smaller town. There were no pediatric surgeons available, no plastic surgeons, she was in the ER with her face ripped open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, our general pediatrician (who is now my kids pediatrician, 30 years later), who had only graduated maybe 10 years prior, sewed her face back together. It was 30 stitches on the inside of her mouth, and 30 or so on the outside. She had a massive scar down the whole side of her face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anway, fast forward 15 years. She grew normally, her face is fine, her smile is fine, no long term damage. Apparently, a face is full of nerves and muscles, and thats why only plastic surgeons work on faces. Particularly with children, having nerve and muscle damage can make their face grow crooked as they age, it is a highly specialized field. But in this case, there was nobody else, just a general pediatrician, and he managed to save her face, with no long term nerve or muscle damage, or even scarring now that shes an adult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We found out 25 years later from our pediatrician's wife, that he spent an hour or so crunching his old med school books in the seat of his Plymouth Reliant in the hospital parking lot, studying facial anatomy, nerves and cheek structure, etc. He walked into the hospital and performed a multiple hour surgery, on her face, sewed it back together, perfectly. You would think a plastic surgeon did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wife told us he came home that night, just flopped down on the couch, and sat that there, amazed that he'd done it. Proud, but cautious. A new general pediatrician, sews a toddlers face back together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it worked. Now, you would never know it happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and he has never, ever, done another surgery like that again lol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit: if the tenses seem odd, it is because he was MY pediatrician then, and now that I am old and have a child, he is our daughters' pediatrician again. And he still calls my by my full first name which still drives me nuts. We chose him for his excellent medicine skills, not his personality. Thank you all for the gold and stories, I will share this with my sister and probably not him next time we see him, though I can promise you he doesn't know or care what reddit is. He doesn't even have a computer except the one he is forced to have at his clinic, and he calls it "henry", to spite the man who made all the doctors in his pediatrics group carry tablet pcs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efap6fb/" target="_blank"&gt; ikilledtupac &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-long-coated-large-dog-_Hzg9rquaIM" target="_blank"&gt; Karolina Wv / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-2/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722467"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722467" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-9-682d9e29e4d4a-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments." title="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;In 2011 I had a saddle pulmonary embolism two weeks before my scheduled wedding. My quite seasoned heart surgeon seemed pretty confident that I'd be okay, and he even said he'd get me to my wedding on time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long story short, I was in the hospital for about a month due to complications. Several weeks later, when I was visiting my heart surgeon for a follow-up, he told me he'd only ever seen two other people as sick as I was.

I was the lowest ranking, most clueless person in the department. I knew a lot about the Kreb cycle, not a whole lot about, you know, medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young man came up to me and said he was sorry to disturb me, he just wanted to check, it was just, well, not to queue-jump or anything, but he wanted to check, can this definitely wait for triage..?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then unwrapped a towel from his hand and showed me his thumb, which he had dropped a loaded barbell onto. It was shattered, just flattened, with splinters of bone coming out. I stared at it. He stared at it. I stared at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I told him oh yes, no problem at all, he'd better take a seat and I'd make sure someone was with him right away.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaq50u/" target="_blank"&gt; Anytimeisteatime &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-working-on-a-machine-with-a-wrench-1qr6pAB8XdY" target="_blank"&gt; Giulia Squillace / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722463"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722463" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-7-682d9cbb8425e-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of numerous larvae wriggling in soil, illustrating moments medical workers pretended to be calm seeing something unbelievable." title="Close-up of numerous larvae wriggling in soil, illustrating moments medical workers pretended to be calm seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;ER Tech here, a few months ago we had an elderly gentleman come in presenting with shortness of breath. As I was getting him into the gown and into hospital socks, I noticed very old, yellowing bandaging around his foot. I inquired to its purpose and he told me it was a large wound on the back of his heel that wasn't getting better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I asked him if I could unwrap it to inspect it/possibly re-wrap it (basic wound care is one of my duties), and it was a literal hole in his heel about 4cm in diameter, skin necrotic around the edges, with a large flap of skin covering the middle. I wasn't terribly shocked...until I swore I saw the skin flap writhe a little bit. I got the patient's consent to look under the skin flap and sweet galactic Jesus, there were 3 sizeable maggots just chilling. I've read about it before but I have never seen it in person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brain went "what in the solar f*ck" and despite my attempt at a poker face, the gentleman read my reaction and asked, "Is it that bad?" I was straight up with him and told him that the wound had maggots and needed immediate treatment and the poor guy started apologizing for "bringing something disgusting." I told him, "I see this more often than you think. Maggots are actually great at cleaning out dead tissue and are used as treatment sometimes." He seemed relieved by that but it was definitely my first time ever seeing a maggot infected wound. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efathfj/" target="_blank"&gt; lilrei160 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bunch-of-bugs-that-are-laying-on-the-ground-4OqvD8Qr4Q8" target="_blank"&gt; Bernd / unsplash (not the actual photo)Dittrich &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722466"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722466" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-11-682d9f0b69280-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation." title="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lots of stories, many already covered by others. I will share this particular story with my legs crossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Motorcyclist came in after some one left turned without checking. He had gone over the hood, slid and somehow somersaulted landing on his a*s sitting up. He slid across intersection mostly on his a*s, getting serious road rash. Luckily he was only a block from hospital and ambulance. They pack him and bring him to the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We end up cutting off his chaps and jeans and begin the cleanup of gravel and sand embedded in his thighs and a*s when all of a sudden, his testicles fall out of his s*****m. He had basically sandpapered a hole in his s*****m while skidding on his a*s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attending pauses, grabs the saline, irrigates s*****m and nuts, fondles them back into place while humming. I handed him some gauze to pack the wound and smiled at the patient who was under a local.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I went on break, went fetal and dry heaved. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efau9d4/" target="_blank"&gt; Assaulted_Fish &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-doctors-performing-surgery-in-a-hospital-a-g3xxk_t7s" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-12/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722477"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722477" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-19-682db04c6cdcd-png__700.jpg" alt="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room." title="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to have my leg rebuilt after a car accident and was eventually sent to Duke university for my surgery. My surgeon was supposed to be like the best orthopedic surgeon in the country, I think he used to work for the Baltimore ravens. Anyway all the doctors from my hospital at home were very unsure if I would even have a functioning leg let alone walk normal again. The first appointment at Duke that dude told me it was really not a big deal and he would have me fixed almost good as new. I honestly thought he was just trying to be nice and optimistic but he was very serious. 5 months later I was walking and learning how to run again. He said I was one of the most complicated surgeries he has had to do and a group of surgeons flew in to observe him do it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; burtrenolds &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-medical-mask-and-robe-UIp163xCV6w" target="_blank"&gt; JC Gellidon / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722498"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722498" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not the doctor, but the patient. In 6th grade, i contracted so many different forms of dysentery that I was placed into CDC quarantine while they tried to figure out where I got it. I was barely conscious throughout the whole time but all I remember is my doctor in my room with me, having hooked up my Wii and playing Brawl as I recovered. I had no clue that my parents were being investigated for child abuse or that I was in quarantine until a few months later, or that I had passed out and had been covered in vomit and s**t for hours before my mom found me and took me to the hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I ended up getting it from someone not washing their hands after handling a snake and then cooking dinner at my science camp. Wash your d**n hands people!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: I do work in the medical field, but I'm not a doctor so technically I am a medical professional. Also, I can't believe my top rated comment is about me being covered in various bodily fluids.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaxbrh/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr4k399 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-44/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722505"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722505" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;As a new nurse, I worked on a nephrology unit, which meant that we dealt with mostly patients who had kidney failure and needed hemodialysis three times a week to clean their blood. A patient was admitted through the emergency room and told me that he hadn't been to dialysis in 4 weeks. He had HIV, kidney failure, had lost custody of his kids after a messy divorce, and had no will to live. He planned to just stay in his home until he died. He probably wasn't far from it, but a neighbor, who hadn't seen him for a few weeks, peeked in the window and saw him sitting, unresponsive on the couch. They called 911 and he was brought to my hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three weeks is an insanely long time to go without dialysis. Dialysis removes toxins and excess fluid from your blood. Missing a session can leave you feeling sick and swollen. Missing 12 sessions can k**l you. This guy was SO swollen. I've never seen a person who was so full of fluid. He looked like that girl from W***y Wonka that turned into a blueberry. His feet and ankles were particularly massive. I wasn't sure that he'd live. Miraculously, after several dialysis sessions, he'd fully deflated. However, he was left with lots of loose skin afterwards, which had the fragile texture of an old balloon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, he called me to his room and said, "I think my foot is bleeding". He was right. He'd slid down towards the bottom of his bed and used his legs to push himself back up towards the top. In doing so, the fragile skin on the bottoms of his feet and been totally sheared away, leaving only tissue and bone and so much blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had no idea what to do, so I just called a Code Blue. The patient wasn't dead or dying, but no part of nursing school or practice had prepared me for an HIV+ patient who had ripped the soles of his feet off and was currently laying in a 3ft wide, rapidlu expanding, puddle of blood. I just needed to get a whole bunch of people to the room as quickly as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I threw on a waterproof gown and some gloves and held pressure on the bottoms of his feet with a towel until help arrived. They didn't know what to do either. We called in the general surgeon, who seemed to think we might be exaggerating the extent of the damage and blood loss. He told us he'd be there in an hour and just to hold pressure until it stopped bleeding. We soaked towel after towel until, finally, the surgeon shows up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He breezes into the room, moves my towel away, and says, "hmph". Then he reaches towards the patients foot, and pulls off a a HUGE, softball sized, blood clot. In that moment, time stopped. He held out his hand, holding the huge clot, and I, without really thinking about what I was doing, held my hand out too. He plopped the clot right into my outstretched hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next moments, several things happened all at once. I realized I was holding a big, coagulated mass of blood. I started dry heaving. I dropped it on the floor. It splattered. The surgeon exclaims, "OH JESUS F**K", not in response to my gags or the fact that he was just splattered by the clot I dropped, but because the patient's foot is now profusely bleeding again. He darts off and tells us to get the patient down to the OR immediately. We get him down there and, on the way back, realize that he'd left a trail of blood down the hallways, into the elevator, and to the operating theater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw the patient during my next shift and he jokes, "I thought you were going to pass out when the doctor handed you that mess!" to which I replied, "Sir, I was positive that you were about to bleed to death".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb160t/" target="_blank"&gt; NurseSarahBitch &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-51/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722461"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722461" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-5-682d9b2aaa6e4-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting." title="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lady came in with possible stroke symptoms (numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, gail abnormalities).

Turns out she had a dissection the entire length of her abdominal aorta and going into her right femoral artery. Left femoral had an aneurysm and was beginning to dissect as well. She had formed a massive clot throughout her abdomen that was miraculously keeping her alive. Basically all of her organs were ischemic (dead).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 5 different teams showed up in the ER to see her.

Right before he should actually be leaving (this can be really annoying if there are people waiting), he says 'I need your advice. `i'm having s*x with my mother.' What do I say? 'Oh my god'? No, I didn't... I said, 'This isn't the first time someone has told me this.' This wasn't true. Turns out that he knew it was wrong, that mother had initiated it, he was trying to extricate himself, and he was desperate for help. But the thought that someone else had been in his position meant to him that he hadn't been judged, that he wasn't doomed or would go to hell, and that there was hope. But he didn't know what to do because the person to whom he should've looked for advice was actually his a****r.

My daughter, who was 3 at the time, had to have a cavity filled. As we were leaving, the dentist told me just to watch my daughter because sometimes kids chew their gums because it's numb and feels weird. So the drive home took 30 minutes and I had been talking to my daughter the entire time to keep her busy. I park my car in my drive way, opened the passenger seat to get my daughter out, and her entire lower lip on the left side is gone. She had chewed it off down to her chin. She ended up in emergency surgery, but the surgeon kept telling us it would be fine and he sees this stuff all the time. She ended up having multiple surgeries, and when she was finally healed, the surgeon told us that it was the worst injury like that he had ever seen. He wasn't sure how she would heal, but you can hardly tell it happened now.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav67r/" target="_blank"&gt; imcloudnine &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/female-dentist-examining-teeth-of-little-girl-at-dental-clinic-mother-supporting-her-little-daughter-at-dentists-office-healthcare-2ni8EfJ9Bfg" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722462"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722462" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-6-682d9c4038ea0-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable" title="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Posted this before:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4th year med student here. On my ER rotation a couple months back, I walked in to the ED and was immediately asked to help a nurse and resident put a catheter in a patient. Now a catheter placement is usually a one person job so I was pretty confused as to why they needed my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I walk into the patient room, and I’m immediately greeted by a disgusting rotting flesh smell. Worst thing I’ve smelled in my life. The patient has to be pushing 400 lbs and has the worst edema (soft tissue swelling) from congestive heart failure I’ve ever seen. His s*****m and p***s f******n are about the size if a small watermelon, and the f******n had swollen completely over the tip of his p***s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nurse had a speculum (tool OBGYNs use to look inside vaginas) inserted into the man’s f******n while the resident took the catheter in a hemostat (pliers type thing) and jammed it into the man’s pee hole for 20 minutes. They finally got the catheter in and took the speculum out. It was covered in a thick brown discharge that looked like fermented p**s-s**t. I still don’t know how he let his s*****m and p***s swell that much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: We comforted the patient the whole time and kept telling him we had done it like this before. Total lie. No one in the ED had ever done or seen anything like it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaqetq/" target="_blank"&gt; Trisomy__21 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/close-up-of-medical-worker-with-drop-bottle-and-catheter-professional-female-doctor-in-uniform-at-hospital-diagnostic-and-clinic-support-healthcare-and-modern-medicine-concept-k5T21KKuDes" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722476"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722476" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-18-682daf81d0d05-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable." title="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A little late to the party—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not the worst, but I had a patient once with a stomach bleed and a small bowel obstruction. We had to put in an NG tube (tube that goes in your nose and down to your stomach) to drain/decompress his stomach, which was pretty distended and hard. &lt;br&gt;I’m inserting the tube and has soon as it hits this guy’s gag reflex he projectile vomits and SPRAYS very dark, half digested blood all over himself, the bed, the wall, and the floor. It’s basically a scene from the exorcist. I had to dive out of the way and somehow was unscathed. He couldn’t stop for almost ten minutes as we’re trying to get this thing down to where it needs to go. Finally finish placement and it immediately suctions out ~3 liters of this black sludge that is old, digested blood. Pt was mortified and we had to play it off like “oh no no it’s fine, it’s really common to vomit during the procedure. We’ll just go get some towels and clean you up!”&lt;br&gt;My coworker and I left the room and just stared at each other in silent shock.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; oh_haay &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-wiping-his-face-in-front-of-a-mirror-C09E-8WkjFE" target="_blank"&gt; Natalia Blauth / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722471"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722471" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-14-682da308b3bc9-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting." title="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I used to do psychiatric evaluations in an emergency room setting. One time, I'm evaluating this 60 year old woman who is lying in the hospital bed. I'm asking her questions, and she stops me and says, "Excuse me, but I need to pass some gas." I let her know that this is a medical setting and that is a completely normal body function and not to be embarrassed. People pass gas all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not prepared for what came next. She let it rip, and out came the loudest, wettest, and longest sounding fart I have ever heard. It was bubbly and juicy, hitting all the deep notes while ending on a squeaker. I don't think Satan could have made a noise like that with his a**s.

When I came back I politely asked if she needed a nurse for anything in case she needed to be cleaned up after that, but she declined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously I've witnessed people farting before, but I've never heard or smelled anything like that before.

Had an inmate/patient come in with complaints about severe lower abdominal pain. He told me that he had something stuck in his "prison pocket." Before i could ask him what he stuck up his a**s, he bends over and shows me a cord sticking out. I told him, "Don't trip, I'm sure the doctor can help you out with that. You'll be alright." Come to find out, the prong of the phone charger got caught up into something and it was stuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As i was trying to comfort him, I started to hear this vibrating sound. So i asked him if he heard it do. He said, "It's the phone inside me that stuck with the charger."

Unfortunately, the first thing that comes out of a shotgun when it is fired is a gust of air... which changed where the gun barrel was pointed when the shot came out. The shot pellets ended up hitting everything but his heart - lungs, ribs, spleen, stomach, liver, pancreas, and large and small intestines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the OR, the attending surgeon told me to put my hand on his beating heart because that will likely be the only time in my medical career that I would touch a beating heart. I did. It was cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He survived. Though, he was on the trauma service for the entire month I was there, and was in the hospital for a long time further.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efavafv/" target="_blank"&gt; BananaFrappe &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/text-HoneMAhhCXI" target="_blank"&gt; Maxim Tolchinskiy / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-20/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722480"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722480" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-22-682db1f9030b9-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of fresh green leaves with detailed texture and veins, highlighting the natural calmness seen by medical workers." title="Close-up of fresh green leaves with detailed texture and veins, highlighting the natural calmness seen by medical workers."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Happened to me, not a medical professional. Friend of mine bought a house and I moved in with him to help fix it up, polish it and then maybe sell it. So we are in the backyard pulling weeds and cutting down vines and I see this 4 inch diameter vine with fuzzy roots attached to the brick, climbed all the way up the wall. I'm not a particularly country boy, more urban, but my friend had warned me of poison ivy in back of the house. I called him over and he said "oh don't worry, it doesn't grow that big". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He was wrong. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Less than a week later I'm covered, up and down both arms bad enough I look like a 3rd degree burn victim. It has gotten into my bloodstream and appeared on my legs, back, chest and even my feet (which all had been covered of course). I remember my GP looked at me with my shirt off and said in the most nonchalant voice "oh, that's not quite the WORST I've ever seen" with serious emphasis on the one word. It took me two weeks of steroids to even return to work and another two weeks to lose the last of the boils. I spent that time researching poison ivy and I have to brag, I'm an expert on how to track down and murder that f*****g plant. I hate poison ivy. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit - People are asking me for tips on killing the stuff. Go to your local hardware store and they will sell a container of poison ivy killer. The stuff is good but if you use it as directed I can guarantee the stuff will return time and again to haunt you. The vine originates underground, not very deeply though. Dig around (while covered in protective clothing etc) and find the main trunk of the vine. Drill holes through the vine about half the diameter of the stalk and space them about 3-5 feet (1-2 meters) apart. Pour the poison ivy killer directly into the hole. Do not dilute it. Just pour it right in. Soak the vine well, maybe 50-100ml or 1/4 - 1/2 cup, depending on the size of the vine. This should do the trick. Of course it will need to be dug up and out but it ought to be pretty dead within a week. If that doesn't do it, repeat the process a second time. Also, do this when there is no rain forecasted. Good luck and k**l it dead!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 2 - Also, it seems everyone either has a story about getting it all over and hating it (I'm so sorry for you!) or telling how they are immune to it. Fun fact about that, allergies change. You can be immune all your life and then one morning wake up allergic to just about anything. Funny story to illustrate this, I told someone about my poison ivy situation once and she told me about her little brother who was apparently not allergic. He would play pranks by grabbing it and rubbing it all over himself to try to convince other people that it wasn't poison ivy. He pulled the prank one day and had a wedding to attend two days later. He suddenly developed the allergy under the suit. Moral of the story, k**l the plant when you find it. Evil evil little b*****d... &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 3 - Last tip I just remembered. If you go out in the woods and suspect you are going to encounter poison ivy etc at all, bring a can of spray deodorant with you. The aluminum chloride (I think that's the chemical) in it will neutralize the oil and prevent allergic attack. Otherwise scrub with soap and water within ten - fifteen minutes after exposure.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efard08/" target="_blank"&gt; TheMisterOgre &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/green-plant-on-selective-focus-photography-Z_JF_BjNbZY" target="_blank"&gt; James Whitney / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722484"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722484" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-24-682db2cfd425f-png__700.jpg" alt="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept." title="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a medicalprofessional, but I have impressed a couple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not super weird but just uncommon I guess. I was overweight but active when I was younger and broke my lowest rib while snowboarding, long story short, I did not know it was broken (honestly) so I never got it checked by a doctor. The rib traveled up over the next 2 ribs and has since fused to them. I now have a permanent tilt on my spine where this rib attaches to it and now that I have lost some weight a bump you can see/feel on my chest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is kinda weird when you tell a doctor about something on your body and their face lights up like a kid on Christmas and they ask for permission to feel it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efal3qx/" target="_blank"&gt; ptsfn54a &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photography-of-person-playing-snowboarding-during-daytime-9SGGun3iIig" target="_blank"&gt; Bradley Dunn / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722485"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722485" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-25-682db33749419-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago (2000) I was playing soccer and noticed a little skin irritation underneath my arm. I thought it would go away but it developed into a weird thing. It was about 2 in in diameter and grew to be a collection of essentially looked like hundreds of skin tags grew together in a little circle. I went to the doctor who didnt have a clue and he sent me to a specialist. While there it seemed like he didnt know either. This was further evidenced when 4 other doctors came in to take a look and were really interested. They took a ton of photos and told me they hadnt seen this before and couldnt really offer any medication and said they would monitor it. About a week later the 'skin tags' developed little circles on the top that turned into scabs within a couple days. Then, the thing just kinda dried up and fell off me. It was f*****g weird and to this day I have no idea what it was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not comforted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efapvbw/" target="_blank"&gt; negative_space_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-blue-and-white-collared-shirt-wearing-green-face-mask-odggKTyA5o0" target="_blank"&gt; National Cancer Institute / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-31/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722490"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722490" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-29-682db5dad2524-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting." title="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to see an orthopedist oncologist because I had two sarcomas. One in my left thigh in the sciatic nerve and one in my left pelvic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My surgeon said he would get both out and the most I would get would be a drop foot (where you can’t lift up your foot on your own). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went back two years later and my doctor told me he thought he would have to remove my leg because of how the sarcomas were enmeshed in my bones, muscle, and nerves. I honestly thought the whole time that it was an easy out. Though the two 10 hour surgeries may have been a clue that it wasn’t so simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days I have a limp as I’m missing half my left pelvic bone and most of my glute and thigh muscle- but I got to keep the leg!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efan6cq/" target="_blank"&gt; Resse811 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-medical-professional-examines-a-knee-injury-kKEHYN6gALQ" target="_blank"&gt; Judy Beth Morris / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722493"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722493" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient in this case. Had pain in the lower right part of my abdomen that grew more serious over a few days. Eventually got so bad I nearly passed out and was on my bathroom floor screaming on the third night. That morning I felt much better and went to work, but felt the pain coming on again that evening. Also decided to go into work the next morning while running a fever that was getting steadily worse. Finally decided to go to the doctor, where they immediately referred me for a CT scan. My appendix had been ruptured for a day and a half at that point, and I had sepsis/gangrene/massive infection. I was in surgery within a few hours, but prior to that the nurse that was with me said, "Yeah, this will be no problem. You'll be fine." Surgery was ok, but was followed up with a bunch of time in the hospital on intravenous antibiotics. My primary care doctor called me while I was recovering and told me the CT scan was one of the worst they had seen. The doctors I saw post recovery all had a *holy s**t* look when they saw scans and read the surgeon's report. Kudos to that nurse who kept me calm before surgery. Don't screw around with lower abdominal pain.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efarrun/" target="_blank"&gt; blownapp &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-39/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722496"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722496" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Probably too late to the party, but I had a lady come in to the ER listed as “Multiple Medical Problems”. This usually means diabetes and the issues stemming from it or maybe bleeding issues from another disease or maybe odd blood tests results at a clinic. I hadn’t seen the patient yet, but the Dr. came to the nurse’s station asking who had room 15. I jumped up and followed him into the room. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I walked in and saw what I thought was a corpse. Then the patient’s eye swiveled over to look at me. She truly looked like one of the people they found in a concentration camp. I could see every bone and her body was twisted in a decorticate position with her jaw locked open. Then the smell hit me: rotting flesh, death, and body fluids. I struggled to keep a neutral face and not gag. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I tried to place a blood pressure cuff on her arm and her skin just started flaking off in my hands. I gagged. The dr. started removing her clothes to examine her. Her feet were black to the ankles. Her hip bones were poking through her skin and were black. The skin around her ribs was worn away to oozing muscle fibers. Her calves were incredibly swollen and the skin was splitting like ripped pants. I removed her Depends, and there was feces coating her entire genital area. Then the dr. went to remove a large bandage on her lower back. Her entire sacrum was exposed and the bones were BLACK! The skin around it was a black liquified mass. It smelled like nothing I’ve ever smelled. I can’t even describe it. The dr. Told her family I would clean up her ulcers and wounds in preparation for surgery (liar, no surgeon would operate on her). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I had no idea how to clean dead bone tissue and liquified skin (they don’t cover that in nursing school). When I went to clean her sacral area, all the liquified skin separated and oozed all over the bed. I really struggled to keep my s**t together. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Afterwards, I needed a moment in the supply closet to cry it out for a second. I had no idea the human body could breakdown so much without dying. I still think about that woman sometimes and what led to her living like that. It still breaks my heart.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb1pnt/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722465"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722465" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-8-682d9d6350c07-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors." title="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’m an RN who specializes in wound care. We see a lot of crazy things in my clinic. A common occurrence is a pilonidal cyst, which is an abnormal growth in you gluteal cleft (aka butt crack) that contains hair. It usually happens with younger ppl (say 13-20s) and is obviously very embarrassing to the patient. When we get them, they’ve already had the surgery to open and extract the cyst, so there’s a few holes left that we have to heal. One poor soul that came in had the worst post surgical “hole” I’ve ever seen. It was so big, it extended from the top of her crack to the top of her a**s, then our on either side about 12 centimeters. It was like the surgeon carved out most of her butt :( The patient was devastated, and I tried to comfort her by telling her she’s not the worst I’ve ever seen.

Had a homeless guy call saying he stepped on a nail "about a year ago". I could smell it from the door so I expected it to be bad, but when I went to pick up the leg by his heel there was just...nothing there. His foot just evaporated into pus and maggots and his metatarsals clinked through my fingers. While I'm standing there trying to comprehend what happened he just sighed and asked me to pick up his foot (what foot buddy?), put it back on. He said "it falls off a lot these days, but it still hurts so that's good right?" I had no clue what to tell him.

To get a study done you need to poop clear mucus. Three days we bowel prepped with heavy laxatives and enemas. He barely pooped anything. He puts on the call light at 6:45, 15 minutes before my shift ends. He calmly says, "I kinda want to try and poop." He said it so casually I figured he was going to toot out another gas bubble and walk back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stood from the bed, took one step, and the floodgates burst. 3+ days of the most rancid liquid stool I had ever encountered. It just wouldn't stop. He left a river of stool from the bed to the bathroom, coated the walls as he bend to park his butt on the toilet, and continued to dump out 7 people worth of poop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my 9 years I have never seen that much come out of a person. He was not a large man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was so embarrassed but I just kept my face as solid as possible, grabbed half the linen closet and 3 packages of cavi wipes, and sopped it up.

When I was getting treated for cancer I got a really bad case of pneumonia and had to be intubated and put into like a semi-coma type deal (I don't remember anything that happened in those six days but I was apparently made sober enough to open my eyes for visitors every day so I don't know if that counts as a coma). It was some pretty serious pneumonia because it was like less than two days between my first cough and them making the call that I would need to be intubated to stop me from drowning in my own fluids, so they didn't mess around and gave me a ton of antibiotics. You know how some hospital beds have a track along the ceiling that they can hang IV bags from? I had enough antibiotics hanging from mine that it broke and fell to the floor (again, no memory of this).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the thing that was truly unprecedented occurred when they were changing out my butt-bag (I don't fully understand what it was but they had something on or under my butt that collected all my bowel movements, they put it on after I was heavily sedated, and removed it before I was totally awake so I don't really remember it). For anyone who doesn't know, antibiotics can cause a lot of diarrhea. Apparently when they rolled me on my side that day I let loose a fire-hose of liquid s**t that arched through the air across the room and splattered all over the door and window which were about twelve feet away from my bed. I think it's super cool and funny so they didn't have to pretend like it was normal to comfort me.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaht4f/" target="_blank"&gt; FlutestrapPhil &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-hospital-room-with-a-bed-and-a-monitor-CjgwW0VR3d0" target="_blank"&gt; Frederic Köberl / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722479"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722479" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-21-682db135f113e-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Medical student here.

Before showing me and her Ob/Gyn the problem, she apologized that I had to see it probably because I'm male but I told her I've seen plenty before, especially in the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While not the worst thing I've seen (gunshot to the head takes the cake), I don't think I've seen skin so badly chafed before and it looked like she might have had the beginnings of mastitis on one of her breasts since it was red, warm, and very tender.

I was particularly lucky in nursing school and got to watch open heart surgery, joint replacement, kidney removal, all kinds of neat stuff right over the surgeon's shoulder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only one that ever gave me a problem was this kid about 10 years old getting his tonsils removed. The doc had this hooked knife, he's reach into the kids mouth, hook the tonsil, and yank it back to cut it out. Blood flying out of the unconscious kid's mouth. So I'm standing there, I look up and all of a sudden everything's getting sparkly. I just said "I need to leave. Right now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surgeon takes his tools out of the kid's mouth and says "OK. Someone please walk him out, thanks." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I learned that for some reason, I get queasy when it's kids being hurt. Which is funny, because I was a pediatrics nurse for quite a while after school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the actual story. I wasn't even at work, but maybe four years ago, was living with my girlfriend at the time and her three young boys. That day, the youngest (about 7), had been climbing up a big lilac bush in the yard that I'd trimmed the day before. He slipped and fell out. A sharp, cut branch caught him in the face on his way down. I was in the kitchen, and heard this blood-curdling scream and ran outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought him in, sat him on the kitchen table and took a look. It seemed like he was pretty lucky, there was just a deep cut on the bottom of his nose. Well, it was bleeding pretty decently so his mother and I took him to the emergency room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We get there, there's only a physician's assistant on duty. He takes a look and thinks maybe it could use a couple of stitches. Or, he says, he could call the on-call ENT surgeon for another opinion. We told him that, all due respect, we would like to have a surgeon take a look, just in case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good thing we did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boy had nearly taken his entire nose off his face. The stick cut up under the nose, and traveled along under the flesh up to the bridge. The entire nose was hanging by a half inch of skin at the top. We just hadn't moved it much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as the surgeon came in and pulled this little boy's nose off his face, while he's laying on the exam table screaming absolute bloody murder, suddenly I got really hot, things start getting hazy, I realize I'm about to pass out. So I quickly exited the room and sat down, at the exact same time as my girlfriend, who was also a nurse. Neither of us could take it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaj1mk/" target="_blank"&gt; Gullex &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722488"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722488" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-28-682db581e748a-png__700.jpg" alt="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments." title="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm a nurse and I work in a pediatric ER.

I obviously didn't treat the patient myself, but I discussed his case with his doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The patient had severe anxiety and therefore hadn't been to a doctor of any kind in approximately twenty years. He ended up in our office because his wife had called the day before and expressed that he needed to be seen due to a foot infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he arrived, he approached the window and told the receptionist that he was sorry because his socks were dirty as he hadn't made it to the laundromat recently, which was a bit weird in and of itself, but we work for a podiatrist--we've seen it all before, as it were. He then sat in the waiting room, and it was mere moments before the smell seeped into the administration office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The receptionist put him in an exam room as quickly as possible, and upon her return, she informed me that the infection was literally oozing out of his sneaker. All we could do was open the widows and apologize to other patients as they arrived. It was foul, and when I entered the room after his appointment to clean it (the medical assistant was out that day), I immediately began gagging and had to forcefully push my manager out of the way as to avoid vomiting on her on my way to the restroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turned out, the dude had had the infection for approximately three months, and had been showering with his sock on since he'd discovered it. He literally hadn't removed his sock from his infected foot in three months, and his wife had somehow been living with the overwhelming smell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The doctor said it was the worst infection he'd ever seen, but the patient was so incredibly anxious that he got the standard, "I've seen it all before," throughout his appointment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efat2ul/" target="_blank"&gt; MedusaExceptWithCats &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-49/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722504"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722504" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Yep.

One called it a ticking time bomb. His heart had 2 chambers instead of the normal 4. He didn't have the big arteries that led from the heart to the lungs but a series of smaller ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will never forget the first time I saw him take his shirt off and you could literally see his heart beating in his skinny chest. Literally, every beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of 25, 3 years after we were married, the time bomb blew. 7 years later I very vividly remember his chest moving as his f****d up heart beat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efay1co/" target="_blank"&gt; ZoraTheDucky &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722508"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722508" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;In dental school, I had an emergency patient come in, complaining of sore gums. Upon examination, I found a massive calculus bridge (google it for pictures) behind her lower front teeth. She only had about 3 remaining lower teeth, but they were all connected with a whitish brown mineral deposit that was about the size of a golf ball. She had never had her teeth cleaned and she was probably 55 or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I basically performed an emergency cleaning. She could speak so much better afterwords. Of course I had to play it off like it was normal, but in my years of practice I still haven’t seen a case that bad again. Get your teeth cleaned people. Even if you can’t afford every 6 months, once a year, or every other year is a hell of a lot better than never.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efawcda/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722511"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722511" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Worked in a heart procedure lab that helped try to get rid of bad heart rhythms. A prisoner came in for a last ditch effort to help his failing heart and had developed a condition called Ventricular Tachycardia. Setting the patient up and looking at his rhythm / heart, it looked pretty bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Before we got started he grabbed me on the arm and said "I'm scared.

I got the cart set up for a vaginal exam, got her vitals, blood and urine (she couldnt pee because of the pain she said), all the basic jazz you do when someone comes into the ER. I process my samples and let the nurse know everything is done and she goes to talk to the woman and it essentially goes as this: no, she hasn't had any trauma, no no a*****t, no she doesn't know what's going on, but it started about 3 weeks prior. Long story short, we get the Dr as the woman refused to let the nurse take a look, and we are all in the room when the Dr turns the light on under the drape and immediately asks if she's been using any medication vaginally, there's clearly a lot of irritation and swelling as well as a VERY strong odor and she hadn't even inserted the spec yet. The woman says no, nothing. At this point the nurse goes to get some saline and I'm left to hand off tools and handle any swabs. The first swab handed to me was literally tinged a pale green, clearly infection. I'm capping it and the woman smells the odor slowly filling the room finally and starts apologizing. I had to say while trying not to gag "no no need to apologize, I've seen much crazier things, just relax and we will get you all fixed up." Well, the nurse comes back with saline and the Dr starts essentially flushing this woman's v****a trying to clear out all this discharge and infection so she can see what's going on, and all of the sudden she stops and asks if she's SURE she hasn't been putting anything in her v****a to treat any medical condition, even something not given by a Dr. And that's when we found out for about a month, this woman had been douching with a bleach and water mix to try and cure a yeast infection, because she read that "in hospitals we wash down with diluted bleach to k**l germs and thought it would work." She was riddled with chemical burns and infection and was immediately transported to a bigger hospital. So yeah, that happened. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatinp/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-14/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722487"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722487" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-27-682db4485f40c-png__700.jpg" alt="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support." title="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Obligatory not a medical professional, but a first aider. I was doing a duty at the finish line of the London marathon as I have done for many years. I've seen enough chafing, dehydration and blisters galore. Someone always has the worst of the day but it happens so fast that you can hardly mentally tally who's nipples were the most raw.... &lt;br&gt;Until I had a runner come in covered in blood complaining that her nipples had completely gone. She had chafed so bad that her nipples and areolas were rubbed to nothing... And the worst part was that she had her nipples pierced and the piercings had EMBEDDED THEMSELVES IN HER EXPOSED BREAST TISSUE. &lt;br&gt;I had to talk her through sterilising the wounds while trying to assure her that 'it happens to everyone'.

I got called in on a Saturday for a lady who had an infection from a component separation. Basically they put a giant piece of mesh in you for hernias. I wasn’t prepared. When we lifted up her gown.... the smell wafted and I have never almost puked before until that moment. About 20 cm circle around her umbillicus was black and necrotic. It was absolutely awful. We basically removed the entirety of the necrotic tissue all the way down to the peritoneum. Just gray and black slimy mass of fat and skin. The worst part is that I had to measure the necrotic tissue and it requires me to lean in a little close to it. The surgeon was laughing because I was green when I got back to the surgical field. Then during that surgery another person who had the same procedure had come to the ER with an infection. AND THEN A THIRD! We stopped using the mesh because that’s what was getting infected.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasneb/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-37/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722495"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722495" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;ER RN here. So, so many:&lt;br&gt;1) vaginal discharge the color and consistency of guacamole stuck on a speculum post-pelvic exam. The patient’s husband had recently been released from a period of federal incarceration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The first time you smell a really funky, long-term GI bleed (bleeding into the intestines, usually the colon). P*o + blood = murder most foul. And the patient is sometimes a sweet, incredibly sick little granny watching us gag as we clean her up, apologizing for the smell, and we have to just say, from behind the peppermint oil-soaked mask, “oh sweetie, it’s okay, we do this all the time...”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Dead, sloughed intestinal lining. Another smell that will haunt your daymares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the winner winner chicken dinner in the “No, no... it’s not that bad... I’ve seen worse...” category was the homeless dude who came in complaining of blood in his urine. He wasn’t able to pee more than a few drops at a time, so we used a little ultrasound machine to see how much urine was in his bladder. More than 1000ml... you just bought a catheter sir. I tasked one of our male patient care techs with the job and had barely gotten back to the desk when he came running out yelling, “I need some HELP! Grab gloves!” &lt;br&gt;I lifted the gown covering this guy’s junk and grab the p***s to help...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAGGOTS. IN. THE URETHRA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he was pissed off that we removed them because, “...in the Corps in ‘Nam, they teach ya to eat yer maggots!

They were fused to his skin from the middle of the hip all the way down to his calf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to surgically remove his jeans by basically cutting the skin around the point where it was fused, and the moment the scalpel made the first incision, she described it as "As if Slimer from Ghostbusters barfed out of his leg." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, there was enough gushing, green fluid, filled with maggots, that it covered the floor in the (small) examination room, and the nurse ran out of the room gagging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting over the initial shock, they managed to peel a good amount of the skin off with the pant leg, and revealed that his lower leg had basically rotted all the way to the bone, and was full of maggots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently that's the moment when she knew she was meant for the job. Even the surgeon was having a pretty hard time keeping his composure, but she was fine. More fascinated than anything, and apparently not affected by bad smells as most people are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to tell him his leg was going to be OK - he was severely mentally ill and might have freaked the hell out - despite knowing he could die from the infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently he survived and they managed to save the leg, which is beyond incredible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav3b3/" target="_blank"&gt; Bonghead13 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-45/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722502"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722502" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Orthopedic Xray tech here.

Apparently the surgeon had a photo taken, post extraction, where he is cradling my dad's ~22.0 lb spleen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To top it off, one day into recovery, when doing on of those "gentle push on the abdomen" type exams on him, my dad's sutures catastrophically failed and he let loose a spray that coated the doctor, his nurse, and a good portion of the ceiling. Luckily for dad, the hospital staff was on point that day and kept him alive despite his body's best effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I heard all of this from the doctor while he was removing the line of staples (that went from c****h to sternum) some weeks later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dad didn't like to share, apparently.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efauzo8/" target="_blank"&gt; CallousJack &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722517"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722517" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was working as a CNA in a nursing home. There was a lady who had been neglected before she came in so she had stage 4 bed sores (all the way to the bone) and the treatment nurse wanted me because I am calming and really good with the residents that needed a little support. She has me roll her on her side and then carefully peels back the bandage. I'm staring done in half horror/ half fascination as I can clearly see the bone, ligaments, muscle, layers of skin... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm gawking hard and the nurse is showing me some neat procedure when I hear a small, frail voice, "Is it getting better?" I turn on my biggest, friendliest smile and reply, "It does! It looks SO much better. Does it feel better?" She smiles and nods; I change the subject to grand kids (she had a picture of them). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven't seen anything like it before or since.

Never seen that before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another was a patient with shoulder injury, both sides. Got an MRI, and both shoulders were basically destroyed.

Cause I’m freaking out, you’re my first patient!” The laugh usually breaks the ice and keeps me on task. It’s served me well thus far. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I examined a woman’s knee last week and after about 5mins, I said, “Well... you definitely should talk to a doctor about this!” I am aware I will get sued one day...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasfrl/" target="_blank"&gt; antianchors &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-46/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722510"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722510" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Had a patient who had a melanoma the size of a cauliflower head on the back of her ankle.

So basically you could just have a look at him and tell that something was very, very wrong.&lt;br&gt;He stuttered that his wife was absent so he took some time to watch ''some videos of a certain s**y type online that inspired him''. Internally I started screaming, but on the outside I just nodded and acted like it was something I heard routinely. He proceeded to explain to me he had seen a video of someone putting a metal rod up his urethra and tried the same. But he used too much lube and it slipped inside. I remember stopping breathing for a second. He was just so embarrassed that I told him that this happens sometimes and we had seen it before. Well, no. Stuff up the butt, yeah, we see that. But this was a first. I pulled up the ultrasound machine hoping this was just a training situation by my attending to prank me, but nope, there was a glorious 10 cm long pen inside this man's bladder. &lt;br&gt;So he had hoped to have it extracted magically at the ER and then to go home. Well, he had to have surgery and stay overnight, his wife eventually found out. I kept the picture of the ultrasound as a souvenir and this memory as a great story to tell friends when they ask how my ''routine life'' is going as a (now) doctor.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efar49f/" target="_blank"&gt; chocpretzel &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-60/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722516"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722516" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’m a surgeon. &lt;br&gt;A couple of years ago they send us this guy (52 yes old) that had shown up in the ER because he allegedly hadn’t pooped in a week or so. &lt;br&gt;To make a long story short X-ray showed he had SOMETHING lodged in his r****m (and sigma, and descending colon... so way up there) that was a little over a foot long. &lt;br&gt;He denied having put anything up there. Yeah, right.&lt;br&gt;We try to go from the bottom up and nothing. We see something but we can’t clamp onto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. What now.&lt;br&gt;Operating room. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ended up opening him up, and inside the colon we see a hand. I just about s**t myself, ended up being a mannequin’s arm. Like store mannequin. It was stuck up there up to the elbow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was an odd one.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efay3u7/" target="_blank"&gt; ilariaenne &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-62/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722522"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722522" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;We had a patient in the ER who was sick of her visual hallucinations so she scooped her eyeballs out.

I used to get really bad ear wax buildup, so occasionally it would get enough that I'd go and get them cleaned out at my local clinic. The poor guy who was stuck doing it for me, really young-looking so probably still a student, at one point says under his breath, "God, this is so gross."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Less related, but I remembered another story involving this guy. I went in once and they needed to do a strep test. I have a really strong gag reflex, so I warned him about it before he did the test. Dude looks me dead in the eyes and says, "You're not going to gag.".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efask8t/" target="_blank"&gt; itsbeck &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-65/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722521"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722521" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient. In middle school I somehow coughed so hard it tore a small hole in my lung. Everyone assured me it was more common then you would think, and that it's actually not to hard to fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believed them until they asked if the med students could observe. Well of course!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 of them filed in, lined up, and took turns squeezing my neck (where the escaped air ended up settling), and going "hmmm" "well would you look at that" and "oh my".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After they left I told my doctor "You know, for how common this apparently is, all those students seemed pretty interested in it." He replied with a half guilty grin and a nod, like yeah bud I caught you but can't really blame you for trying to calm me down.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efats8x/" target="_blank"&gt; BoredsohereIam &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-67/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 23:02:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9FSS1iektLQmlSSjVLWUpGRHU4WVNDeGRRa1A1WHhmRnhWQld6ZkdkMkhIMWxFSzVtVjAwZHFRUWdGTUhYZEI2UFJjMHVUTHpndEI5ek9kWG5oRjRMYlRHd1RQNmpvb2ttcXRuNHFRa2dINTNhSFA0</guid></item><item><title>在弗吉尼亚州确诊的第二例麻疹病例- WTOP | 2nd case of measles confirmed in Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQNFNhWHJxNHhWdlFfVXVhcllUeFJUVS1UeW5nOU8wc0FON3VCUWtZYjBWaUxfWWpFVFh4dXBrSjZoMnhhbVNJLTRQSW1lNnZSLXdjNFg2cEdQX2Vpc2ZHRXdpRGhRdGFUTU9CSGF0MlJyeFNEV21FZk1Ha3pKLWNDeG0tUjd5ZnJYSXhmYjBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health said it was a teenager from the northwest region of the state who had recently traveled outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials released the following locations and times of when and where the teen could have exposed others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlottesville Albemarle Airport between 2:15 and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play it Again Sports store on 1885 Seminole Trail in Charlottesville between 2:40 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodwill Store and Donation Center on 440 Gander Drive in Charlottesville between 3:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health Primary Care Riverside clinic on 2335 Seminole Lane, Suite 200 in Charlottesville, from 2 to 7:10 p.m. on Thursday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health University Medical Center Emergency Department on 1215 Lee Street in Charlottesville between midnight and 6 a.m. on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the first measles case was reported in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; — a child under 4 years old who possibly exposed other people in clinics in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/05/23/virginia-health-officials-confirm-second-2025-measles-case-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said, “measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should contact your health care provider immediately if you have symptoms of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to protect yourself from this disease, go to the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state’s health department website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there are 1,046 confirmed measles cases, up 22 from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed only 10&lt;/a&gt; more cases this past week for a total of 728.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;major outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in North America. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=323859266e21469b8b97a294d6c6f98e&amp;amp;sc_lang=en"&gt;1,795 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through May 20, an increase of 173 cases in a week. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;538 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-measles-vaccines-misinformation-mmr-mennonites-misinformation-ea6158b9a4d513b20f33cbc09034e5c2"&gt;Mexican state of Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt; had 1,578 measles cases and three deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some infected with one among the 12 in this group of bacteria have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both have stories to tell, stories they hope will prevent fishermen and beachgoers the pain they have endured, and spare some the agony of an even worse fate for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It was 2016, Empson was wading in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, vacationing and fishing with his family. It was summer and warm coastal water — water temperatures above 70 degrees — is primed for one of this bacteria’s killer — vibrio vulnificus , the flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, sometime in August, Empson attended Sunday Mass at St. Thomas More in Baton Rouge. Each hand clutched a walking cane. He needed both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Got vibrio,” he said. “At the hospital (in Mississippi) I was told, ‘Your leg or your life.’ I chose life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Empson said he believes vibrio vulnificus attacked his right leg on the fifth fishing day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“My grandson fished every day just like me, but his immune system must have been stronger than mine,” Empson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began feeling symptoms that night. They packed up the next day, and he said he believed he could make it to Baton Rouge for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We left about 11 (a.m.) and I told my grandson to find a hospital nearby. I couldn’t make it home. We got to the emergency room in Bay St. Louis, and when they found out we’d been at the beach, they were calling for a surgeon, and they immediately moved me into intensive care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a doctor looked at his leg, saw blisters forming and told him he had a two-hour window “...t o receive medication to counteract what was happening. Otherwise, they would have to amputate the leg. He told me I had a 20% chance of the medication working, and I told him to take the leg, that I could learn to walk again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks in the hospital and more weeks of rehab in Baton Rouge left him with two canes. Now, he needs one to get around, to do yard work and fish – “I fish only from the bank. I still have a boat, but haven’t been in it for years. I still want to fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I can’t figure is that I didn’t have a scratch on my leg, and the (hospital) staff believe it entered through my pores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux, a never-say-die fisherman, is a three-time victim, twice from cuts while handling shrimp and crabs, and once after eating raw oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external variety, the vulnificus, is much more virulent than vibrio gastroenteritis, the strain from raw shellfish, although Arceneaux tells of a lawyer he knew who ate an oyster poboy and was dead 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux’s advice is to be cautious when buying live bait.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Live-bait tanks in the marina are a petri dish for staph, strep and vibrio,” Arceneaux said. “Handling shrimp in contaminated watercraft is the way I got vibrio the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second time I was handling five dozen crabs to entertain friends. I kept the crabs in a crab call (a basket submerged in water next to his camp) and I got a scratch on my arm. That was on a Thursday and within 24 hours I was on the way to the hospital and had surgery within two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a photo of Empson is easy on the eyes, and easy to show the near-immediate effects of this virulent strain of vibrio, images of Arceneaux’s arm split open – a surgeon removed all the dead tissue — is gruesome. Even the image of scars running from hand to shoulder are not for the squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“It was 36 hours at the Baton Rouge General for the next one. To survive, I’m lucky twice, very lucky,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;While coastal water is the usual contact point for vibrio, Empson said his support group in Baton Rouge has a member who lost a leg after getting vibrio from False River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The CDC says…&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pages devoted to vibrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its key points is that vibrio’s variety of bacteria “naturally live in coastal waters,” that you can get vibriosis after swallowing the bacteria or getting it in a wound, that the bacteria count is higher in coastal waters from May through October, and, if you suspect an infection, to seek medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency estimates around 80,000 cases of vibriosis occur each year in our country, and 52,000 cases come from eating contaminated food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common gastric signs/symptoms are watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs of bloodstream infection include fever, chills and the two indicators for Empson, dangerously low blood pressure and blistering skin lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;And, for wound infection, signs/symptoms are fever, redness, pain, swelling, warmth, skin discoloration, leaking fluids discharge and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the CDC warns about preexisting conditions, complications like liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, thalassemia; taking medicine to decrease stomach acid levels; and, recent stomach surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vibrio vulnificus, the CDC’s warning is clear: “Many people with the infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux said he continues to fish and enjoy oysters, the latter only when coastal water temperatures dip below 70 degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;He said he carries enough hand sanitizer, a chlorine bleach-water mixture and antibacterial soap on his fishing trips to immediately treat scratches. Puncture wounds need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux message is clear: “In 11 days, I had three surgeries and had two IVs treating me with four different antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot fix this yourself. If you suspect you have a problem with vibrio, go to a hospital emergency room immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						Health officials in Provincetown, Massachusetts, issued a warning of potential exposure to hepatitis A on Saturday, after a food service worker was infected with the virus.In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment and the Provincetown Board of Health warned anyone who dined at The Red Inn at 15 Commercial St. in Provincetown between April 30 and May 15, that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A and should contact their healthcare provider.According to the DPH statement, the food service worker at the restaurant who worked during those dates has a confirmed infection with the hepatitis A virus.As hepatitis A is highly contagious, the DPH urged customers who may have been exposed to the virus to contact their health care provider immediately to receive appropriate medical treatment.The DPH said preventive measures against the hepatitis A virus include the hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A immune globulin.However, the DPH said these are generally only effective at preventing hepatitis A infection if given within two weeks of exposure, prior to symptom onset.The DPH said early signs and symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (dark urine, yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes). Hepatitis A typically varies in severity, with mild cases lasting two weeks or less and more severe cases lasting four to six weeks or longer.Additionally, the DPH said some people, particularly children, may not develop jaundice and may have an illness so mild that it can go unnoticed.However, the DPH said even mildly sick people can still be highly infectious, and people who become sick with hepatitis-like symptoms should consult a health care provider, even if the symptoms are mild.Hepatitis A can be spread between people through food handling, and the DPH said it can be spread by contaminated food and beverages. The DPH advises customers who dine at The Red Inn between April 30 and May 15 to practice thorough handwashing, especially before preparing food, to avoid any potential further spread of the virus.

It's a notion that a wealth of science backs up, and now a new study may shed more light on how this link between a parent's past trauma and a child's upbringing might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and other scientists have been studying the ways trauma can be passed down for years now, and much of the science has shown that it goes far beyond replicating our parents' mistakes, as we all used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that trauma experienced during pregnancy &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468749924000309" rel="nofollow"&gt;impacts the fetus&lt;/a&gt; in ways that are predictive of everything from poor life outcomes to mental illness. Even more fascinating, the study of epigenetics has shown that trauma changes our very genes such that it can be passed down from generation to generation in our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found, for example, that &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(15)00652-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow"&gt;descendants of Holocaust survivors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jpsychopathol.it/article/view/566" rel="nofollow"&gt;Black Americans who were enslaved &lt;/a&gt;show genetic markers of those traumas despite having never experienced those events themselves, or even, in the case of slavery, often being multiple generations removed from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.14118" rel="nofollow"&gt;recently published Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; further showed how trauma goes far beyond just experiencing traumatic events themselves. It followed 501 Canadian families from the time their children were 2 months old until they were 5. All the mothers reported experiencing childhood traumas on the list of so-called "ACEs," or adverse childhood experiences that are predictive of poor life outcomes and mental health struggles. The list includes everything from parents divorcing to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that maternal childhood trauma was substantially linked to both socioeconomic level and how attuned and responsive mothers were to their kids' needs. The traumatized moms in the study tended to be poorer and less sensitive overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking anecdotally as a child of a mom like this, the latter is often a result of the former. Regardless, poverty is itself on the list of ACEs, and low attunement and sensitivity can be forms of neglect, which is also on the list of ACEs. So it's easy to see why this has such an impact on kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-has-been-through-lot-life-according-research"&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Through A Lot In Life, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When it came to the traumatized moms' kids, they showed three main tendencies:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Emotional problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/moms-childhood-trauma-raise-kids-emotional-problems.png" alt="Man who had a mom experience childhood trauma and he now has emotional problems" title="Signs Your Mom Experienced Childhood Trauma" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;cottonbro studio | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is certainly no surprise. Children of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/kids-thrive-mom-dad-depressed"&gt;parents with anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt; are far more susceptible to having anxiety and depression themselves. And given that financial struggles alone are decisively linked to anxiety and depression, let alone childhood trauma, it's unsurprising that many of the mothers in the study had these conditions, and so did their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unsurprising but important finding: The moms' rates of depression were also linked to their kids' fathers' histories of what the study called "conduct problems." The fathers' negative behaviors strengthened the link between maternal anxiety and depression and the same conditions in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-parents-trauma-dumped-affecting-now"&gt;5 Signs Your Parents Trauma Dumped On You As A Kid &amp;amp; It’s Affecting You Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Behavior problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found a strong link between the mothers' lower sensitivity and kids who were aggressive or rule-breakers, and an even stronger link between these behaviors and relationship conflict in the kids' parents, which itself was in turn strongly linked to maternal trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here again, the fathers had a major impact, though. A &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-raised-emotionally-immature-father"&gt;father's own history of behavior problems&lt;/a&gt; as a kid was linked to their own children's issues. We can infer that this was also linked to the marital discord observed, though the study did not delve into this specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Struggles with academics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final outcome observed was &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/parents-blame-teacher-middle-schooler-failing-math"&gt;cognitive difficulties in kids&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it came to vocabulary and math skills. The scientists found that the moms' levels of sensitivity were the biggest factor, and resulted in low test scores in these skills for their kids. This is, of course, in line with the wealth of data showing childhood adversity has a direct impact on learning and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study's authors say their findings are in line with what's called the "interactionist model" of child development. It's a sort of trickle-down effect that scientists call a "cascade of risk." Trauma impacts moms' mental health, socioeconomic level, and marital relationships, which impacts their ability to serve their kids' emotional needs, which in turn impacts their children's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while one of the study's limitations is its lack of in-depth examination of fathers' impacts on all this, it nonetheless gives yet more confirmation that we should view trauma not as discrete events that happened to one person, but events that have wide-ranging impacts.

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials, and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have been shown to have the gene are advised to have whole-body and brain MRI scans. They are also recommended to have breast and abdomen ultrasounds as adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit, and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 18:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMS04Ym9BUjJMNDFTcE1NUjFsWGk3UTZBY19HOHZsWEg1eGYyek1JM1lJcnhHaUx4V3JwNTJySXBIbXNNV3hzSXdVUVcwYWR4U1FaaEdmdkFiUzEwYmtXdjk2VVFkcVFrUGE5TW5yZ2RTcW5fblBXcW10ZU1qaWJUVnRaeXcyM2NibWJORVNwdjlLRXM2eGgwd3NhdTQ</guid></item><item><title>Caturday Pootie日记：夏天来了- Daily Kos | Caturday Pootie Diary: Summer is coming - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQbDFaR3JjQWtZMDgtUzU0Y2pxUW1tblRjZy12ekFSWmF1cnZRZExLeFljek9QM0x0QjFpVzRGaVh6Y2t1d0tvRWdsbVJsLU9BMTE4cEJMSC1wVlo3S0JaaTJPT1p5Mlh3d2lSbjdiNWJOdzNucGdwcUNyZlJGZVNrbU9qVW9ueGI0MERZNno5aTFFMUxM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I shook my head at the cat staring hopefully up at me. “You can’t have any,” I said, taking a bite of my sandwich. “You’re diabetic and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Surely I can have one little bite,” he argued. “One little bite won’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It might so we aren’t taking the chance,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed, and turned his back on me to lie down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gentle reminder of how we do things:  &lt;/em&gt;🐱🐶🐦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Do not troll the diary. If you hate pootie diaries, leave now. No harm, no foul.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please do share pics of your fur kids!  If you have health/behavior issues with your pets, feel free to bring it to the community.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs.  Birds... are birds! Peeps are people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whatever happens in the outer blog STAYS in the outer blog.  If you’re having “issues” with another Kossack, keep it “out there.” This is a place to relax and play; please treat it accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some pics we never post:  &lt;/strong&gt;snakes, creepy crawlies, &lt;em&gt;any and all photos that depict or encourage human cruelty toward animals.&lt;/em&gt;  These are considered “out of bounds” and will not be tolerated.  If we alert you to it, please remember that we do have phobic peeps who react strongly to them.  If you keep posting banned pics...well then...the Tigress will have to take matters in hand.  Or, paw.I snatched an apple out of the bowl on the kitchen island and dropped it into the lunch bag, then satisfied that I had enough to eat for the day, I zipped it closed. The microwave signaled that the egg was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




          &lt;p class="story-intro-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;He stood and stretched (“Oooh, goooooooood streeeeeeeetch!”) then turned toward me and placed a paw on my lap. “I could lie on the furry blanket?” he said, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so hot,” I whined. “I’m sorry, I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You aren’t fun anymore,” he huffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spring is not my fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m getting fewer treats — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re crunchy and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no kibble — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can only have soft food for just a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep shooting that terrible stuff down my throat!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced at that. The day after his procedure, his cheeks had swelled up a bit and the vet gave us some antibiotics for him just to prevent any infection that might be brewing from taking hold. The liquid was thick, and brown, and decidedly sludge-like. “I’m sorry about that. Only a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep taking me to the vet! You left me there &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was to help you!” I defended myself. “And as long as your healing keeps going well you won’t have to go back for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should be nicer to me,” he said, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My credit card is being very nice to you,” I shot back, then immediately regretted it. That wasn’t his fault. “I don’t mean that,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t even know what that means,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, and petted him in attempt to defuse the situation. “It’s been a rough few weeks,” I commiserated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It really has,” he agreed, settling down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry. This will be a good summer. Your mouth is going to feel so much better. No more pain!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That will be pretty good,” he grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned down at him. “I wish you would tell me when you were hurting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t do that!” he said, scandalized. “What about the predators!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled. “You’re an indoor cat,” I reminded him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do this summer?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleep,” he said, immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” I said. “That’s the best way to beat the heat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like to eat, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are all things you do all the time,” I pointed out. “Is there anything you want to do just for summer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought about it. “Keep to myself and not be near any humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed. “Yeah, that is your favorite summer activity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Are you going to spend time in the weird big water dish?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Probably a lot of time,” I said. “You could go swimming with me. I bet you can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recoiled a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or not!” I said, quickly. “I’d never force you!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Human, the ducks go in there,” he said with exaggerated patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but I’m not afraid of them. And they don’t go in the backyard when I’m out there. I scare them away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat in silence for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They poop in there,” he said, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my turn to recoil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was partially asleep when I felt Freddie get up. He wasn’t trying to hard to keep me from waking up, walking over my lap without grace or gentleness. “Ouch,” I murmured, opening my eyes. “Where are you going?” I asked as he jumped to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to get a head start on Summer,” he said, over his shoulder as he left the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore me?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore you,” he confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Caturday, Peeps! On Sunday night Freddie had some swelling in his cheeks and I called the vet (they are a 24/7 eVet as well as a regular clinic so someone is always there). I really thought it was a normal reaction but I just wanted to make sure. They told me it was not, in fact, a normal reaction and that I should bring him in. Since he was eating and not having trouble breathing, they made me an appointment with his regular vet for the next morning instead of recommending I bring him in that night. The swelling was better in the morning, but I still kept the appointment. His lungs were clear and he didn’t seem to be in any extra pain, so the vet just gave us some antibiotics to take home and instructed me to come back if the problem didn’t improve or got worse. He said that diabetes can sometimes complicate healing. By the next day, the swelling was gone altogether so I don’t think we’ll have to go back. He does seem to be doing pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the data, just 13% of kids received the upgraded COVID vaccine within the same time period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weekly COVID deaths are likely a result of insufficient vaccination uptake, according to Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine specialist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute, reported ABC News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some recipients of the vaccine, however, might not be exhibiting a healthy immunological response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poland noted that the chance of contracting COVID-19 increases when immunity to the vaccine diminishes over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is currently advised that people 65 and older have two doses of the upgraded COVID vaccination in the gap of six months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 death rate in the US is now highest among people 75 and older, with 4.66 fatalities per 100,000, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Savvy Senior,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I take Advil pretty regularly for arthritis pain and headaches, but how can I tell if I’m taking more than is safe?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Achy Alan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Alan,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen – better known by one of its brand names, Advil – is one of the most popular medications on the market today for treating all different types of pain, headaches, fevers and cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the drug’s broad pain-reducing effects, safety record and availability over the counter (OTC), it’s no surprise that some people pop the little brownish-red tablets whenever they feel the slightest twinge of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But ibuprofen, which is also sold under brand names like Motrin and Nuprin, can pose certain health risks, especially for those with kidney or stomach issues. Here’s what you should know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What’s Safe?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most adults and children ages 12 years and older, the recommended OTC dose of ibuprofen is one (or two, if needed) 200-milligram tablets, caplets or gel caplets every four to six hours while symptoms persist. You shouldn’t take more than 1,200 mg (or six pills) in a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t consulted a doctor about how much is safe, or if you aren’t certain about your risk factors, it’s best not to exceed the recommended limit of 1,200 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have chronic pain, or were recently injured or had surgery, your doctor may prescribe ibuprofen for you at a higher dose. Prescription tablets are usually stronger compared to the OTC dose, such as 600 mg and 800 mg. The maximum daily dose for prescription-strength ibuprofen is 3,200 mg in a 24-hour period. But it’s important only to take what your provider has prescribed for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also be aware that ibuprofen is sometimes added to certain cold and flu medications, so always read the ingredient list on medications before using them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Be Cautious!&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by blocking the activity of certain enzymes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these enzymes also help maintain kidney and liver function and regulate the balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. So, taking ibuprofen can be dangerous for patients with kidney disease or failure; those with liver damage or cirrhosis; and people with conditions that put strain on their kidneys, like high blood pressure or heart failure. Those at high risk for these conditions – as well as for stomach ulcers, heart attacks, strokes or bleeding problems – should talk with their doctors before taking ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who take medications such as diuretics, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) to manage cardiovascular issues should also be careful, because ibuprofen stresses the kidneys and the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce these health risks, don’t take the maximum recommended dose for more than a week or two at a time. If you are needing it for more than two weeks, or if you’re turning to ibuprofen every day to keep your aches and pains in check, you need to see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When taken for long periods, ibuprofen can also increase the risk of stomach ulcers. The drug inhibits enzymes that, among other things, aid in the production of mucus that lines and protects the stomach lining, so without these enzymes, the stomach becomes vulnerable to irritation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some alternatives to ibuprofen you should talk to your doctor about include acetaminophen (Tylenol), topical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) that is not absorbed into the blood to the same extent as oral NSAIDs, nonacetylated salicylates, curcumin (an active ingredient in turmeric) and acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send your questions or comments to questions@savvysenior.org, or to Savvy Senior, P.O.

Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Convergence:&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Bacteria Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097a6c7b7f606a6c49716068616c797c6b65607a6160676e276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelly Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xiahepublishing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelly Zhang – Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14218/ERHM.2025.00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oral Microbiota Transmission Partially Mediates Depression and Anxiety in Newlywed Couples&lt;/a&gt;” by Neil Daghnall et al. &lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p id="p21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ</guid></item><item><title>这是您不想忘记清洗的身体部位： “总是捕捉污垢” -《纽约邮报》 | This is the one body part you don’t want to forget to wash: ‘Always traps grime’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSllFZTJiRC1aVmRrVjl1NzM1eWxkQVFhQ3dyblg5ZlZ3SUFMSlRLQXBuWmwxQUJPQ1hISmoxYnY4d3hyRU9ybFU2YmV4LUZjZWJoRVBYVDhaSGY0U2dRampKdkM3OHIwS3g4VEZ6ZHJEUUdESXE1bThJQ2dPVmVnMy05NjlBZ3AybUp3NnQyUXlhOUZBNEo1YXFQMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;You might be rinsing and repeating — but you’re probably not as clean as you think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists say there’s one spot most people overlook in their shower routine where dirt, oil and dead skin cells can accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, that buildup can lead to bacterial infections, painful skin problems and a foul odor that lingers long after you’ve toweled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies show roughly two-thirds of Americans shower daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daria – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/how-to-clean-your-ear"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that your ears do a good job of cleaning themselves, so you can probably toss the Q-tips. But the area around them is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend people wash the skin behind their ears intentionally and specifically to get into the creases of where the ear meets your skin, as it can always trap grime,” &lt;a href="https://www.beloithealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/roger-kapoor-m-d-m-b-a-f-a-a-d-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roger Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and senior vice president at Beloit Memorial Hospital, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true in summer, when sweat and sunscreen create a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who wear glasses, the arms resting behind the ears can also easily transfer bacteria to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ear-itation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oil, dirt, and dead skin cells piling up behind your ears can clog pores and cause painful pimples and acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also irritate your skin — and even trigger &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/what-to-know-about-ear-eczema" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ear eczema symptoms range from hardly noticeable to extremely uncomfortable.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;artem_goncharov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory skin condition causes red, itchy patches that can be dry, flaky or waxy, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any inflammatory condition of the skin can lead to cracks in the natural skin barrier, allowing bacteria in and causing infections,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://stcharlesdermatologicsurgery.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stacey Tull&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and micrographic dermatologic surgeon, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-wash-dirtiest-body-parts-in-shower-study-8384889"&gt;told Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even tiny cuts, piercings or scratches inside the ear can open the door to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rare but serious cases, those infections can spread beyond the ear and into the bloodstream — potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, when the body starts attacking its own organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s that smell?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections behind the ears can also give off a foul, cheeselike stench, often thanks to bacteria, yeast and fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smell-behind-ears#causes"&gt;according to Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Possible causes of a smell behind the ear include poor hygiene and infections.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Krakenimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sweat gland behind the ears also secrete perspiration starts to stink once it mixes with bacteria and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add sebaceous glands, which secrete a waxy mix of oils and fats, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious funk if it builds up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem can be even worse for people with overactive glands that release extra sweat and oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wash up — and when to get help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an infection is painful, you have a fever, swollen lymph nodes or home treatments like over-the-counter antifungal creams don’t work, it’s probably time to see a doctor, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325081#prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some infections need stronger antibiotics to clear up and prevent serious complications. Doctors can also prescribe anti-inflammatory ointments to soothe eczema symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors can help diagnose pain behind the ear and recommend various treatments.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bnenin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the area behind your ears is simple to clean. All you need is gentle soap and warm water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is probably remembering to scrub the area after hitting all the usual spots in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kapoor says shampoo can help break down oil and bacteria behind your ears, but it rinses off quickly unless you specifically scrub the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wear glasses, he also recommends cleaning the arms regularly to keep bacteria from transferring to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

Mariya Borisova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that vitamin D supplementation may help preserve the lengths of the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes known as telomeres.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers say maintaining the length of telomeres may help slow some aspects of biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomere length is an important component of healthy aging, but the role vitamin D can play isn’t yet certain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reports that vitamin D supplementation may help slow some of the mechanisms of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shortening is a natural part of aging, but it has been linked to certain age-related diseases. Among those diseases are cancer of the bladder, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said &lt;a href="https://www.augusta.edu/institutes/gpi/gpi-faculty/zhu.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Haidong Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, the first author of the study and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/vitamin-d-supplements-show-signs-of-protection-against-biological-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree the new research is interesting, but they note it has its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Telomere length was protected with vitamin D supplementation, but it’s not clear how that translates to real life biological aging,” &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/marilyn-tan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Marilyn Tan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine at Stanford University in California, told Healthline. Tan wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study involved only a relatively small number of people, looked only at telomeres in white blood cells, and did not look extensively at the health impact of these telomere changes,” added &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. “So, the clinical implications one can derive from this study are quite limited.” Cutler was likewise not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers based their findings on the results of the &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; randomized controlled clinical trial, which was overseen by Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers tracked 1,054 participants to see if vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; can lessen telomere shortening and slow biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study group included females ages 55 and older and males ages 50 and older. The researchers followed the participants for five years, measuring telomere length in white blood cells at baseline, year two, and year four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that omega-3 fatty acids had no significant effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they said vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening and prevented the equivalent of nearly three years of aging in people who took vitamin D in comparison to people who were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say such a slowdown in the aging process has important benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Slowing biological aging may improve life expectancy and quality of life, and it could reduce the risk of various disease states,” Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of vitamin D have been touted over recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/vitamin-d-recommendations-insufficient-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also indicated that a sufficient amount of vitamin D may help improve heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;35% of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in the United States have a deficiency of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;current recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for daily vitamin D consumption is 400 to 800 international units for most healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage#deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is known as the “sunshine vitamin” because the best source for it is sunlight. Your body makes dietary vitamin D3 out of the cholesterol in the skin when it is exposed to the sun’s UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun#time-of-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;best time&lt;/a&gt; to get the most of this beneficial sunlight is noon, when the sun is at its peak. However, experts say that too much sunlight can cause sunburns, eye damage, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heat-stroke" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, and skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of foods that are sufficient sources of vitamin D, but there are a few.

To know exactly how much vitamin D supplementation one needs, you should discuss with your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler said people with healthy vitamin D levels probably don’t need supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been many studies involving tens of thousands of people seeking to document [the] benefits of vitamin D in healthy adults with normal vitamin D levels, and no benefits have been found,” Cutler told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been no documentation of reduced cancer rates, less &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, increased longevity, protection from infection, or improved outcomes from &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-coronavirus" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best-supported strategies to preserve telomere length are &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/benefits-of-aerobic-exercise" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, diet, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/stress-coping-eliminate" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and avoiding harmful substances like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;,” he added. “These lifestyle changes don’t just preserve telomeres — they also broadly support healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:23:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOVktSjE5ZWN5VHRSRkdGYjl2c196ZG1pNWpWclBfcTJNbzF6VUZuc0xRNS1nbmpLT0hLMjl1NVB5bjhJWDRGamoxV2d4NW9meUd3UWRadnFOV3lfNjFFSW05YzU5V1BWTi1zOGdBRlhIdEtER2NpbXpydjBpWmFZSHNyY18weWZfMnVFT2pscw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超过十分之一的老年兽医使用大麻-《华盛顿邮报》 | More than 1 in 10 older vets uses cannabis, study finds - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQSFU4dEhaVmN3amQ0QXJDOWlBeUtQU1lfWXZBeTdseWJxU1hfYVhSNE9WRHZ3TXp1blo1OHpKbWFlYVNqWGsyZGh6cXAwZEVFYlBmVnBvN25QZmtxQVFnSVdEeTlSS0ptQ25zbE5SN09nLTNGanQ0aUtkSXZwdWVWSWFqbmN1ajJZOXJBbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DLXIEOHSZG5JGHJTEXTA3WMYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 1 in 10 veterans ages 65 to 84 used cannabis in the previous month, a new &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.10173" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data published in JAMA Network Open suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3RMBDDVIMRGDNCZGUWYCYOV63A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To learn more about cannabis use in older adults, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs Cannabis and Aging Study, which follows a national cohort of veterans and their cannabis use.

However, its effects typically last only a week, and frequent dosing poses risks like dissociation or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study demonstrates that ketamine’s benefits can be extended up to two months by using a compound that enhances ERK signaling, a pathway essential to ketamine’s long-term action. This breakthrough offers a proof of principle for safer, more sustained depression treatment strategies targeting intracellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid-Acting Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine alleviates depression symptoms within hours, even in resistant patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; A compound called BCI prolonged ketamine’s antidepressant effect up to two months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing ERK signaling may help sustain antidepressant effects from a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population is afflicted with major depressive disorder at any given time, and up to 20 percent will exhibit MDD symptoms over their lifetimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its prevalence, methods to treat MDD often fall short for a not-insignificant portion of the population. Antidepressants—the standard of treatment—don’t work for 30 percent with MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infused at a low dose ketamine shows remarkable efficacy as a rapidly acting antidepressant, with effects observed within hours even in patients who have been resistant to other antidepressant treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110354"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.

Limbird Chair in Pharmacology and is the Barlow Family Director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers in the field had determined that ketamine’s antidepressant effect requires the activation of a key signaling pathway called ERK, but only ketamine’s long-term effects—not its rapid effects—are abolished when ERK is inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine relies on ERK-dependent synaptic plasticity to produce its rapid behavioral effects. Ma and colleagues hypothesized that they could maintain ketamine’s effects for longer periods by enhancing ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent paper, Ma discovered that ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be sustained for up to two months by using a drug called BCI, which inhibits a protein phosphatase and results in increased ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the use of BCI make the application of these results to the clinic difficult, Monteggia said that the results provide a proof of principle that ketamine’s antidepressant action can be sustained by targeting intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kavalali, the William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics and the chair of the Department of Pharmacology, have worked on the project since its inception and hope that it fosters other studies looking to identify specific molecules that will enhance and sustain the action of a single dose of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this work will be a steppingstone toward improving MDD patients’ lives by reducing the burden of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afc2ceddc6dcdcce81dcc7cedfc6ddc0efd9cec1cbcaddcdc6c3db81cacbda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marissa Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marissa Shapiro – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Monteggia et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where everyone searches for the secret to living a long and fulfilling life, the wisdom of those who have actually achieved extraordinary longevity is invaluable. Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life.Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;“Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One rule the 115-year-old world’s oldest woman lives by every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;“Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethel Caterham’s early life and formative experiences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How emotional well-being impacts longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A life rich with experience and travel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;115 years of life, love, and calm: What Ethel teaches us about longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday in the warm company of friends, family, and caregivers. More than just a milestone, her journey reminds us that living a long life is not only about the years but also about how they are lived. Her story shows that inner peace, emotional stability, and finding joy in everyday moments are key to lasting well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical lessons From Ethel Caterham’s rule for long life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid unnecessary conflict&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on listening and understanding rather than arguing, which can reduce stress and promote emotional health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what you like&lt;/strong&gt;: Prioritise your happiness and well-being, embracing personal autonomy and enjoyment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay curious&lt;/strong&gt;: Embrace new experiences and cultures to keep your mind active and engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice emotional resilience&lt;/strong&gt;: Develop habits that support calmness and mental clarity, such as mindfulness and deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supporting healthy longevity with modern science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从源头瞄准疟疾：药物处理蚊帐消除抗性蚊子中的寄生虫- Phys.org | Targeting malaria at the source: Drug-treated nets eliminate parasites in resistant mosquitoes - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1qc1hBcTdJSC13VDktczhiWHBMOWUwdDhRR2Vrb1FYNTZMUFNuajN0SG9oQndlTHptU1pZR05TN0JjX3Y1TTNkQ292VzgtV2V3Q0g5emRNQ0dCSUtFdDEzUnpTNDB5NFlXMm5FVVo5LUpjZkgzVVJ4RNIBd0FVX3lxTE1jcGlBeXowSFJ2R3R2aGJaWi1LdWhHeFV1WEdzSXVibm5INkFYbTJ3Qm1wUGdTaWhBTk9MR0w3cF8wWEFZUF9ETzFYT0FScm9GTTRRalU4clkxdUV2dWV0MWViR0pGdWtVeE5zY1JzVXU4QnRfUnE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a type of chemical compound that, when applied to insecticide-treated bed nets, appears to kill the malaria-causing parasite in mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2" target="_blank"&gt;multi-site collaborative study&lt;/a&gt; represents a breakthrough for a disease that continues to claim more than half a million lives worldwide every year. A lab at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University played a key role, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the National Institutes of Health, supported the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Riscoe, Ph.D., professor of molecular microbiology and immunology in the OHSU School of Medicine, designed and synthesized the anti-malarial drugs, termed ELQs, that were then screened in the lab of Flaminia Catteruccia, Ph.D., the study's senior author and Irene Heinz Given Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELQ drugs refer to a class of experimental antimalarial drugs known as endochin-like quinolones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was a very clever and novel idea by Dr. Catteruccia and her colleagues to incorporate anti-malarial drugs into bed nets and then to see if the mosquitoes would land on the nets and take up the drug," Riscoe said. "The idea is the drug kills the parasites that cause &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/malaria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; instead of the mosquitoes, and our data shows this works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risco said further research is necessary to determine whether the best strategy in the field is to incorporate the antimalarial ELQs together with insecticides in the fibers that are woven into bed nets or simply to use them alone to blunt disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Malaria is a potentially lethal infection that is spread from person to person by mosquitoes. After a significant decline in cases and deaths caused by malaria since the turn of the century, progress has stalled in recent years due to increasing insecticide resistance. In 2023 alone, there were 263 million new cases of malaria worldwide and more than half a million deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Insecticide resistance is now extremely common in the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, which jeopardizes many of our most effective control tools," said Alexandra Probst, M.Pharm, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate in Catteruccia's lab at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By targeting malaria-causing parasites directly in the mosquito, rather than the mosquito itself, we can circumvent this challenge and continue to reduce the spread of malaria."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catteruccia's lab screened 81 compounds for blocking malaria parasite growth within the mosquito. This work identified two ELQ drugs from Riscoe's chemical collection as top hits from the initial screen. The ELQs were even effective when added to materials like those used in mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests showed infected mosquitoes that landed on the surface of these materials were cured of their infections. The ELQs remained stable, continued to work for a long time and were effective even in mosquitoes that were resistant to traditional insecticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If an infected mosquito hits or lands on netting containing either of the ELQs, it's essentially disinfected. It absorbs the treatment via its legs, and that kills the parasites that it's carrying," said Mike Rubal, Ph.D., a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, who contributed to the &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best defense against malaria has been insecticide-treated bed nets, but &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mosquitoes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; are developing a resistance to those prevention methods. This novel approach targets the source of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to test this strategy in the field with ELQ-impregnated bed nets, which is set to begin later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work has the potential to significantly blunt the transmission of malaria," Riscoe said. "I think that it will evolve and develop to be a key element to our success in eradicating malaria around the world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grandmother who suffered a deadly brain bleed has made a miracle recovery—after doctors told the family five times that she wouldn’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millie Beckett ended up in a coma for three weeks after the massive hemorrhage, but her devoted husband never left her bedside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millie’s daughter, Corinne, said the family was utterly ‘devastated’ when the medical team at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Scotland warned that even if the 74-year-old lived, she would be left profoundly disabled and need round-the-clock care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Millie was back on her feet within weeks—and five months later, she has made an almost complete recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mum was in the hospital for eight weeks,” said daughter Corrine. “Honestly, every time I look at her, I could cry. We thought she was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were absolutely devastated when we were told that it was bad news, and she wasn’t going to make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millie, who lives in Inverkip, Scotland, had only retired in 2023 after a career working in social care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are such a close knit family,” her daughter told SWNS news agency. “We do everything together. My mum and dad are our best friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE GOOD NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Man Labeled ‘Brain Dead’ May Be First to Recover from Extreme Locked-in Syndrome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-labeled-brain-dead-may-be-first-to-recover-from-extreme-locked-in-syndrome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Man Labeled ‘Brain Dead’ May Be First to Recover from Extreme Locked-in Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on what happened, husband Thomas, who ran his own fabrication company before retiring, said they noticed on November 30 that Millie had become really confused and disorientated and was mixing up her words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rushed her to the hospital where brain scans were taken. The family was then told that Millie had suffered a massive intra-cerebral brain bleed, which is a type of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They basically told us there was nothing that they could do for her,” Corinne recalled “The bleed was too big to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They found a room for her in the stroke unit. They also gave us a room. We couldn’t bear it if she was to pass away and there was no-one by her side. She was unresponsive and in a coma, but dad never left her side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the days passed the prognosis did not change; Millie remained paralyzed with no speech. “Five times we were told that mum wouldn’t survive, and that if they took her off the machine she would slip away,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three weeks, though, Millie began to respond to treatment, and with the help of staff at the stroke unit, her recovery progressed to the point where, eight weeks after the hemorrhage, she was able to walk right out of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="When Dying Boy’s Life Support Was Turned off He Began Improving–and Went Home with Parents" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/when-boys-life-support-was-turned-off-he-began-improving-and-went-home-with-parents/" rel="bookmark"&gt;When Dying Boy’s Life Support Was Turned off He Began Improving–and Went Home with Parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They offered me a wheel chair but I didn’t need it,” said Millie. “It has been much harder for my family than me. I have no memory of it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracle Millie is now looking forward to her summer holiday in Spain with Thomas—to whom she has been married for 57 years—and enjoying their retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just want to make the most of every day. When I see the nurses in the town, they say to me, ‘There’s our Christmas miracle.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO INSPIRING&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="A Mom’s Love Helps Woman Wake From Coma After Five Years" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/moms-love-helps-woman-wake-from-coma-after-5-years/" rel="bookmark"&gt;A Mom’s Love Helps Woman Wake From Coma After Five Years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family are forever grateful for the team at the IRH stroke unit. Daughter Corinne said: “They were incredible with my mum and with us. They couldn’t do enough for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to give something back, to help other patients.” So the family is now aiming to raise thousands for the stroke unit as a gesture of thanks and to help other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE THE ENCOURAGING RECOVERY On Social Media…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Officials in New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-cases-rise-76-mexico-191843477.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday the tally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/measles-outbreak-spread" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;had risen&lt;/a&gt; to 76 cases, and they confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/measles-death-new-mexico" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of an adult in March was indeed caused by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;58 cases&lt;/a&gt; in Kansas and &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;17 cases&lt;/a&gt; in Oklahoma, in addition to other states seeing separate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US now has a total of 1,024 confirmed measles cases, which makes 2025 the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;second-worst year&lt;/a&gt; already for measles since the virus was declared eliminated from the US in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outbreak may be losing steam in west Texas because of &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;successful&lt;/a&gt; vaccination campaigns and because many people who were not vaccinated have now been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although children have suffered the bulk of cases, about &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/21/texas-el-paso-measles/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of the cases in El Paso are among adults.

All true,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“None of that is true,” Murphy responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Of course it’s true,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Statements like these undermine the public’s confidence in vaccines at a critical time, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Communities that have fallen below the 95% threshold for community immunity (also known as herd immunity) should run vaccination campaigns now, before new outbreaks begin, both Wells and Maresso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The easiest thing you can do, in this case, is just put out an educational campaign around closing the vaccine gap,” said Maresso. “If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks. It’s that effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks.

You’re probably not seeing them on the clinical radar, but there are cases in your community, and you should expect that you’re going to start to see cases – and if they’re not vaccinated, it’s going to get worse.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Local leaders should prepare for measles outbreaks now, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c208955f-49ef-41ba-8036-afb4febc76e4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Measles outbreak: how contagious is it and what are the symptoms?","elementId":"c208955f-49ef-41ba-8036-afb4febc76e4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/02/measles-symptoms-vaccine-outbreak"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some of it’s education to your physicians, your schools, your daycares, about measles, what the rash looks like, just so that people are paying attention to that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health officials should also understand their testing capabilities and the logistics of, for instance, transporting specimens to laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That way, “you’re prepared and it’s at the front of your mind – not sitting back in some dusty textbook,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But all of that work requires funding. While public health departments have frequently worked on shoestring budgets, the Trump administration has made funding even more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There was a clawback of the Covid funding that was available to local health departments,” Wells said. And with other federal funds for public health, “it’s even harder to follow exactly what’s going on,” Wells noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m concerned. It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4yTEN3Nm1VQ1JWMDdpNFV2WXFHdDVDZlpGemhIQ3lvRmxyQWhrWDhCdVBpdzkyMGZGbmR5M2NKdTJNd3l3RmpKQjBkNUtqQS1vNGZzMUk4TXFsMjF2aUJMcnJUcGVxVnJsSmRTeU5YdVZwT0dxM28yOTF3</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，最简单的高纤维交换可以改善肠道健康- EatingWell | The Easiest High-Fiber Swap for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE01QWN1Y0c4XzdLeTZrV0dDb05BQU9IZHRGb3h4b3FNeE8zWTFjTG9scjVNdloyTl8teHNZUzJMT2VnSlFEYkZHdEpyNEY0LThxbWtLWERkZnVpNFFtQzBzcEJHSmg5a3h4cThGZVFKaE9oMlhQQ0JhTHZQRHlTaE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist suggests swapping white bread for sprouted grain or whole wheat bread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White bread is made with refined grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted grain and whole wheat bread are gut-healthy options that can support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe that any food can be enjoyed in a healthy eating pattern. Sometimes this means having less nutritious foods in moderation rather than completely cutting them out of your diet. And it could also mean swapping some of your go-tos with similar, healthier versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent Instagram video, gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fact-or-fiction-gastroenterologist-on-gut-health-myths-8726665" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., MSCI&lt;/a&gt;, shared an easy swap that you can make for your breakfast or lunch. If you’re a toast lover or sandwich fan, this is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s time to rethink your bread, because there’s a high probability that your pantry has white bread, which is made from refined grains,” Bulsiewicz says. He then explains why eating refined grains isn’t the best option for your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When they refine the grains, they’re stripping away the fiber, the vitamins, the minerals, all the good stuff,” he shares. “Throwing that in the trash, and they’re leaving you with the stuff that’s going to spike your blood sugar.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is recent science that shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined carbs can increase your risk for gut and heart problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the flip side, research suggests that focusing on whole grains can help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why Bulsiewicz recommends swapping out white bread for sprouted grain or whole-wheat bread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of whole grain bread means more fiber, slower digestion, better blood sugar control plus the whole grains have antioxidants and phytonutrients that are wonderful for you and have anti-inflammatory properties,” Bulsiewicz explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Brands like Food for Life and Dave’s Killer Bread sell delicious sprouted grain bread in the same aisle as your other favorite loaves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that if you’re a fan of white bread, it’s totally OK to have it when you’re in the mood for it. But if you’re a daily bread eater, swapping for a more nutrient-rich option is a smart choice. Choose whole-wheat or sprouted grain when making a high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046558/best-tuna-salad-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, or when you’re enjoying toast with jam or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;.

SCPD and other health organizations are working to identify as many people as possible who could have had contact with the patient. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Idaho’s state epidemiologists will contact the individual’s area of residence to inform them about the case and “collaborate on the investigation since it is possible that people in both areas may have been exposed,” Dillon told the Idaho Statesman in an email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the case came from someone who lives out of state, it is technically not considered an Idaho case, but an incidence of measles exposure, Dillon also said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC characterizes measles by myriad symptoms that can show up anywhere from one to two weeks after exposure:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;High fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes are the first signs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Symptoms 2-3 days after onset: Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Symptoms 3-5 days after onset: The measles rash will appear, usually beginning as flat red spots on the face at the hairline, later spreading to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are focused on working with state and local health organizations in this ongoing investigation,” Tanis Maxwell, SCPHD Family and Children’s Health director, stated in the release. “Our priority is to keep the public informed and to support anyone who may have been exposed. If you are concerned about measles, it’s important to take preventive steps and be aware of any symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are experiencing symptoms are encouraged to contact their health care provider but should try not to go to clinics, pharmacies or other settings without calling ahead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A preliminary investigation revealed that the individual received the measles vaccine in childhood, making the incident a rare breakthrough case. Despite these cases, the measles vaccine is still considered to be the “best protection” against the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is widely available. The first dose is recommended for children between the ages of 12 months to 15 months, and the second dose between the ages of 4-6. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective and one dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friday’s announcement came after Idaho &lt;a href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/dhw-voice/thinking-ahead-about-possibility-measles-idaho" data-mrf-link="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/dhw-voice/thinking-ahead-about-possibility-measles-idaho" cmp-ltrk="Story body links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="39a90864-cb27-4416-a98b-e18b13598134"&gt;state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern in an April 28 statement that although Idaho had no cases yet in 2025, that could change as the summer arrives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone with questions about measles or the MMR vaccine are encouraged to contact their primary care provider or call SCPHD at (208) 737-1138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNbVhoOHJnQXpIa3Q3MjVyc3RLS0Jtal9nX3NIRmNnMUlSRnBqaDB5TWxkN3hKb3hjWURQUzQ0YUl6YjV5QzhrM1RLRGp6OUkzUlFkV28wVkNqRGdvV293b2Z1TC1UQmFGY2lQbWN1bjRoVEQySTVDV21OYTJld01iNnMybzZTOWM5RDgzWTNyVmlqS2lRaFFXUGJ3M0p4OHpORzZoUldNT0ZEaTJ6SGlF</guid></item><item><title>智能牙线测量压力荷尔蒙，便于实时监测-神经科学新闻 | Smart Floss Measures Stress Hormone for Easy, Real-Time Monitoring - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Engineers have developed a novel dental floss device that can detect cortisol, a hormone linked to stress, through saliva, offering a painless, real-time method for stress monitoring.&lt;/span&gt; The device uses electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs), which act like custom molds to recognize specific molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With accuracy comparable to current biosensors, this floss-based tech could make stress tracking part of daily routines. Researchers aim to adapt the system for other saliva-based health markers, potentially transforming personal health monitoring across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; The floss-based sensor measures cortisol from saliva using advanced polymer molds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Marker Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be adapted to detect other biomarkers, like glucose or estrogen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for untrained individuals, making daily stress tracking simple and noninvasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic stress can lead to increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, decreased immune function, depression, and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tools we use to monitor stress are often imprecise or expensive, relying on self-reporting questionnaires and psychiatric evaluations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110350"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person with a swab in their mouth." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a Tufts interdisciplinary engineer and his team have devised a simple device using specially designed floss that can easily and accurately measure cortisol, a stress hormone, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started in a collaboration with several departments across Tufts, examining how stress and other cognitive states affect problem solving and learning,” said Sameer Sonkusale, professor of electrical and computer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their design of a saliva-sensing dental floss looks just like a common floss pick, with the string stretched across two prongs extending from a flat plastic handle, all about the size of your index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. The fluid is drawn into the pick handle and an attached tab, where it spreads across electrodes that detect the cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol recognition on the electrodes is accomplished with a remarkable technology developed almost 30 years ago called electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They work similarly to the way you might make a plaster cast of your hand. A polymer is formed around a template molecule, in this case cortisol, which is later removed to leave behind binding sites. These sites have a physical and chemical shape “memory” of the target molecule so they can bind free-floating molecules that are coming in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP molds are versatile, so one can create dental floss sensors that detect other molecules that can be found in saliva, such as estrogen for fertility tracking, glucose for diabetes monitoring, or markers for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for detecting multiple biomarkers in saliva at the same time, for more accurate monitoring of stress, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eMIP approach is a game changer,” said Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biosensors have typically been developed using antibodies or other receptors that pick up the molecule of interest. Once a marker is found, a lot of work has to go into bioengineering the receiving molecule attached to the sensor. eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making antibodies or receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy of the cortisol sensors is comparable to the best-performing sensors on the market or in development. Bringing this device into the home and in the hands of individuals without need for training will make it possible to fold stress monitoring into many aspects of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Sonkusale and his colleagues are creating a startup to try and bring the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that while the dental floss sensor is quantitatively highly accurate, the practice of tracking markers in saliva is best for monitoring, not for the initial diagnosis of a condition. That’s in part because saliva markers can still have variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard, but once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;, adds to a number of  thread-based sensor innovations by Sonkusale and his research team including sensors that can detect gases, metabolites in sweat, or movement when embedded in clothing and transistors that can be woven into flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#234e4a48460d504a4f5546516357564557500d464756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mike Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/a&gt;” by Sameer Sonkusale et al. &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-demand dental-floss-based point-of-care platform is developed for the noninvasive and real-time quantification of salivary cortisol utilizing redox-molecule embedded molecularly imprinted polymer structures and thread microfluidics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore the high-surface-area graphene-based electrode substrate for electrochemically synthesizing selective cortisol MIPs and integrate it with thread microfluidics to build a highly sensitive cortisol-sensing platform for stress monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This platform uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. This strategy allowed us to detect cortisol as low as 0.048 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; in real-time with a detection range of 0.10–10,000 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9916).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 11–12 min. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing both artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64–102.4% recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the human saliva sample (as part of the stress study), the platform showed a high correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.9910) against conventional ELISA assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels. It can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers with high sensitivity and selectivity in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了您需要开始服用的关键维生素组合- AOL.com | Doctors Reveal the Crucial Vitamin Combo You Need to Start Taking - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;6 Ideal Vitamin Pairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tanja Ivanova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things just go better together — and that includes certain vitamins and minerals. Whether you want to get more from your supplements or plan a more balanced plate, &lt;strong&gt;pairing complementary vitamins and minerals&lt;/strong&gt; is a win for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain nutrients work synergistically, meaning one helps the other absorb more efficiently in the body,” says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicholas Church, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicholas Church, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified family medicine physician and founder of Somerset Medical. “In my 24 years of practicing medicine, I’ve seen how simple adjustments — like combining the right nutrients — can lead to improved lab results and long-term health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential perk? Saving on supplements, says &lt;a href="https://drwillcole.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Will Cole, I.F.M.C.P., D.N.M., D.C.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Will Cole, I.F.M.C.P., D.N.M., D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a leading functional medicine expert and best-selling author. “Understanding synergistic relationships allows you to maximize nutritional benefits while using fewer supplements,” says Cole. &lt;strong&gt;“Rather than taking random supplements, this knowledge can help you support your wellbeing in a more intentional and effective way.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, experts share the dynamic duos that can give your health a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D and calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may already associate vitamin D and calcium with healthy bones.

is essential for many metabolic processes, from regulating muscle and nerve function to blood sugar levels. Vitamin B6 provides essential support, helping to improve the absorption of magnesium in your intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin B6 helps more magnesium enter into your bloodstream,” explains Cole. “What’s more, magnesium plays a role in activating vitamin B6 into its useful form in the body. Whether patients are taking magnesium for muscle health or sleep, I often recommend taking it with a B6 source, so that each nutrient can boost the other’s effectiveness.” As an added perk, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0208454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that magnesium and vitamin B6 can help relieve stress when taken together. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C and iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is an important nutrient for healthy blood, and vitamin C plays a significant role in helping your body absorb it. You can call them a power couple: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;strong&gt;pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/strong&gt; This same synergistic effect applies if you’re taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you consume iron-rich foods or an iron supplement alongside a source of vitamin C — like a glass or orange juice — it helps convert iron into a form that’s easier for your body to absorb,” explains Dr. Church. “This pairing is especially beneficial to vegetarians or anyone looking to naturally improve their iron levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A and zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; supports your vision, skin health, immune system and more — but it depends on zinc to do its job.&lt;strong&gt; Zinc deficiency &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11756065/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lowers the bioavailability;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lowers the bioavailability&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A, and because these deficiencies tend to occur at the same time, it’s a smart move to combine these nutrients. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen firsthand that vitamin A, whether from foods like carrots or supplements, doesn’t get processed as efficiently when people are low in zinc,” says Dr. Church. “Ensuring you get enough zinc from zinc-rich foods, like beans or shellfish, when you’re also eating vitamin A-rich foods helps these nutrients work together so vitamin A can be effectively absorbed and transported in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants are molecules that protect your cells from damage — and together, they’re even more powerful.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457723011968" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin E and selenium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/a&gt; are a prime example of complementary antioxidants that make an excellent team.&lt;/strong&gt; Selenium has the ability to help “recycle” vitamin E in your body, bringing it back to its active form to fight even more free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By getting both nutrients — for instance, eating selenium-rich Brazil nuts along with vitamin E-rich almonds or spinach — you enhance the antioxidant impact,” says Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D, vitamin K2 and vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about a triple threat: &lt;strong&gt;This fat-soluble vitamin trio works synergistically to support bone health, immune function and proper calcium utilization&lt;/strong&gt;. Together, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin A help ensure that your body functions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K2 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613455/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps direct calcium to bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps direct calcium to bones&lt;/a&gt; rather than soft tissues when vitamin D increases calcium absorption, while vitamin A balances the immune-regulating properties of vitamin D,” says Dr. Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins you shouldn't mix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that not all vitamins and minerals get along. Some nutrients actually counteract each other, which means spacing them out is a smarter approach. Some examples of &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64620677/vitamins-you-shouldnt-mix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin combinations to avoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin combinations to avoid&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, certain nutrients can supercharge the healthy powers of other nutrients when you take them together. But ultimately, synergy is more than just pairing the right nutrients — timing, balance and individual needs matter, too. Always talk to your healthcare provider before adding potential supplements to your routine to make sure they’re safe and effective for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:41:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA</guid></item><item><title>避免阳光照射的女性因在床上翻身而骨折：危险的维生素D缺乏症状-印度时报 | Woman who avoided sunlight breaks bone from rolling over in bed: Signs of dangerous Vitamin D deficiency - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a fall, not an accident, a Chinese woman suffered from a surprising fracture while turning over in her bed in her sleep. While this may seem shocking at first, it was revealed that the 48-year-old woman had shunned sun exposure since her childhood, which had led to the development of severe osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afraid of getting tanned, the woman from Chengdu, in southwestern China’s Sichuan province, avoided short sleeves and always applied sunscreen while stepping out. However, her extreme sun avoidance landed her in soup after it became clear that she developed severe osteoporosis due to crucially low Vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Shuang, an attending doctor in the emergency department at XinDu Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, told the outlet that the woman had avoided sun exposure since childhood, rarely wore short sleeves outdoors, and applied sunscreen while stepping out. Tests done upon her hospital admission disclosed the severe vitamin D deficiency, which had accelerated bone resorption, causing severe osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Unknown Myths About Liver Disease Busted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why sunlight is important for bone health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium is important for healthy bones and Vitamin D lays an important role in its efficient absorption. Without sunlight Vitamin D won't be synthesized well which could compromise absorption of calcium as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our skin is exposed to sunlight, the natural process of vitamin D production starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few minutes of sunshine everyday can help sort this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we avoid the sun for prolonged periods, it can wreak havoc on our bone health. Vitamin D, also nicknamed 'sunshine vitamin' doesn't just boost bone health, it also supports our immune system, keeps muscles functioning, and helps prevent brittle bones. Long-term sun avoidance, whether due to sedentary lifestyle or a fear of tanning, can eventually lead to serious consequences like fragile bones, recurring illness, and overall fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women are going to extreme measures to shield themselves from the sun by wearing wide-brimmed visors, sun-protection gloves, cooling face masks, and lightweight UV-resistant hoodies. While this can provide protection against the harsh UV rays and reduce risk of skin cancer, going overboard can lead to critical Vitamin D deficiency, like this woman experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of critical Vitamin D deficiency&lt;br&gt;  &lt;p type="image" title="vitamin d 2" msid="121380572" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Severe osteoporosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption, crucial for maintaining bone density. A deficiency can result in decreased calcium absorption, leading to osteoporosis, a condition characterized by brittle and fragile bones. This increases the risk of fractures, even with minimal trauma. In severe cases, individuals may experience fractures from everyday activities, such as rolling over in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osteomalacia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, prolonged vitamin D deficiency can cause osteomalacia, leading to bone pain and muscle weakness. This condition results from impaired bone mineralization, making bones soft and more susceptible to deformities and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D plays an important role in brain health. The deficiency of this essential vitamin has been linked to mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. Some studies suggest that low vitamin D levels may affect neurotransmitter function, influencing mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26990827" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="muscle-weakness-and-cramps" source="keywords"&gt;Muscle weakness and cramps&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D levels can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and aches. This is due to impaired calcium metabolism affecting muscle function. In severe cases, individuals may have difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a seated position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent fatigue and a general sense of tiredness can be symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. While these symptoms are non-specific, studies have found correlations between low vitamin D levels and increased fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="22461314" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="dental-problems" source="keywords"&gt;Dental problems&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency can lead to dental problems, including tooth decay and gum disease.

But new research also suggests that logging just five minutes of a particular exercise can help give your brain a big boost, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Age and Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that doing short bursts of exercise that raise your heart rate can help enhance cognitive performance, especially in older adults. But what kind of exercise are we talking about and why does it help? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University; &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 585 older adults between the ages of 65 and 80 who participated in the longitudinal IGNITE trial. The researchers looked at a range of things, including the participants’ &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and sedentary behavior over 24 hours, and stacked that against their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a macro level, the researchers found that people who did more exercise had better brain health. When they did less, it seemed to decline. But when they dug into the specifics, they found that doing just five minutes of exercise that gets your heart rate up—like a brisk walk, water aerobics, or a light jog—was linked with better cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when people did more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity like brisk walking, they had better processing speed, (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is brisk walking good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big perk of brisk walking is that it can get your blood pumping, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Brisk walking increase blood flow to your legs and gets your heart rate up,” he says. “Any time your heart rate goes up, the flow of blood to your head is increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise and movement in general is helpful for brain health, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “What’s good for the body is usually good for the brain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want more walking inspo?

The researchers specifically wrote this: “Moving from ~1 minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to ~6 minutes per day had the largest predicted differences in the domains of executive function/attentional control, processing speed, and working memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is considered “brisk” walking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking is basically any walk speed that gets your heart rate up. "Brisk walking involves moving at a pace where you notice an elevation in your heart rate and breathing rate, which reflects an increased intensity of physical activity," says &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth. "For example, walking at a leisurely pace is representative of low-intensity physical activity, while brisk walking at a faster pace moves into a moderate-intensity level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time you’re short on time for a full workout, consider at least taking a quick walk around the block. It’ll do your brain health a solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton 9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp

It enters people’s lungs when it becomes airborne, causing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/index.html#:~:text=Valley%20fever%20(coccidioidomycosis)%20is%20a,fever%20(Coccidioides)%20is%20found." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;valley fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The fungus isn’t like the apocalyptic zombie strain made popular by the TV show and video game “&lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” But if left untreated, valley fever can still lead to hospitalization and even death, according to infectious disease specialist Ginamarie Foglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“Many people don’t know what valley fever is,” the adjunct professor at Rocky Vista University College of Medicine in Ivins said. “People have to be aware when there’s dirt in the air and it’s being moved, they are at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;And that’s a problem in &lt;a href="https://www.kuer.org/business-economy/2025-04-30/st-george-is-the-states-big-outlier-for-international-immigration-to-utah" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;fast-growing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Washington County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As development gobbles up more and more previously undisturbed desert landscapes, excavators and bulldozers are kicking that fungus into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Construction workers may be the most vulnerable. And that becomes a health justice issue, University of Utah epidemiologist Katharine Walter said, because many of those workers may not have medical insurance or access to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;When the wind carries the dust, plenty of other people in the community are at risk, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“This major excavation of soil that is happening right now to create luxury developments, to create golf courses — that is also creating tremendous dust exposures,” Walter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The main way to mitigate the spread of construction dust is to spray it with water, which is a resource already in short supply in St. George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;To read the full story, &lt;a href="https://www.kuer.org/health/2025-05-20/st-georges-growth-is-kicking-up-the-fungus-that-causes-valley-fever" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.kuer.org/health/2025-05-20/st-georges-growth-is-kicking-up-the-fungus-that-causes-valley-fever"&gt;visit KUER.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:XMVLVJL3LRCNPBGGFTZB4PV65Q" data-fusion-component="XMVLVJL3LRCNPBGGFTZB4PV65Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:XMVLVJL3LRCNPBGGFTZB4PV65Q" data-fusion-component="XMVLVJL3LRCNPBGGFTZB4PV65Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:02:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBFc2EzYjloMmxPVWk2azdMRHBZWjVDT2wyNkdhclQ2X0MxbUNNQ1oydktNSl9Fd1BCQ0VWSVdscUVtNnI2STNlbWdabXZ4R0VUd01icFBvSW9pUzkxMjIzZllZSmZHdmFSVjFTNXJkNlpoVEhuV1lKVmFIdw</guid></item><item><title>一名指挥在几周内体重增加了40磅。需要进行心脏直视手术才能了解原因- CBS新闻 | A conductor gained 40 pounds in a matter of weeks.

    &lt;p&gt;Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a "troublesome" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes," Mauceri said. "Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain," Mauceri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Searching for a diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But "the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest," the doctor said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is pericardial constriction? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no alternative," he said. "I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-risk surgery  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's "heart was trapped" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped," Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell," Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Every day is a miracle"   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it," Mauceri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore," he said. "I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did." &lt;/p&gt;

These inputs include sunset, sunlight, meals, social cues and physical activity that help mark where we are in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all what we call time givers, or they give time to the brain,” he said. In other words, they help the brain sense where it is in the 24-hour circadian cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for a younger person, dinner time may help the brain understand that bedtime is in a few hours; for someone older, this connection may not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerves that are supposed to give the brain time cues have undergone the same amount of &lt;span&gt;degeneration as the brain, Parthasarathy said. T&lt;/span&gt;his inability to sense time cues is part of the reason why older people tend to get tired before their children or grandchildren. And, as a result, wake up fully rested and earlier than the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The light our eyes take in is part of it, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Interestingly, one of [the reasons] seems to be that the vision changes that come with age reduce the intensity of the degree of light stimulation that our brain receives, which plays an important role in ‘setting’ our circadian clock and keeping it on track,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parthasarathy explained that this is especially true for people with cataracts, a common eye condition that impacts more than 50% of Americans ages 80 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Institutes of Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Cataracts cause blurred vision, double vision and general trouble seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If&lt;span&gt; there’s cataracts, the evening light doesn’t go into the eyes as much, so, according to the brain, sunset is earlier than when it actually set,” Parthasarathy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Since there is less light getting into the eyes because of the vision issues cataracts cause, the body starts to release &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/melatonin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="melatonin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/melatonin" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; (the sleep hormone) earlier than it should. For younger people, melatonin “starts rising after sunset,” Parthasarathy said, which is why you generally feel tired a few hours after. &lt;span&gt;For people with cataracts whose brain thinks sunset was earlier, their perceived sunset is earlier, which makes them tired sooner in the evening. And going to bed sooner means waking up earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is some evidence that cataract removal surgery can help improve sleep quality and duration by helping those light cues get through,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The amount of light your eyes take in each evening impacts when you're ready to go to sleep.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is you, there are a few steps you can take to sleep better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Parthasarathy, if you struggle with this issue, you should ignore the advice to put away the screens and instead expose yourself to bright light in the late evening. This can mean going for a walk outside before the sun sets, reading a book on a bright iPad, getting artificial lights for your home or watching TV on a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright lights will tell the brain that the sun hasn’t set yet, which will hold the melatonin production, he said. To help yourself stay up a little later (and sleep a little later as a result), Parthasarathy said you should try these things 30 to 60 minutes before sunset, which will vary depending on the time of year and where you live in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; predicts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and the world is not prepared. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000b3b6madevfu4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00692-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 2.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000c3b6mjhfcv2ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/climate/2024-hottest-year-record"&gt;to a warming climate&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000e3b6mxjc9n0a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000f3b6mpvok5bm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000g3b6mzcvtqmyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002i3b6mghcwbyjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/world/zombie-fungus-ophiocordyceps-the-last-of-us-scn"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002j3b6mds1obbu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that are killing millions in reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000k3b6mlr03crll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000l3b6mtpo31ztq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000m3b6m8qsvu0ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000n3b6mutejajyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000o3b6m8g0c2e0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w3psi00263b6m31fma28r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000q3b6m5oea2g0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0v4x2j001i3b6m87ll1lwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w56hf00283b6mrvayn1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000t3b6mihcjfnoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000v3b6mpwmmxgiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000w3b6mg33vq8ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000y3b6miw0w6cms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3620763/" target="_blank"&gt;as the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0vacg9001s3b6m7ny7em58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Aspergillus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00103b6mhskzz2pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00113b6mkf33h6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wexbn002n3b6mivne2o96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00143b6m9j3smscr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00153b6mgxsiubj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The creator of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, who once boasted he had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, found himself defending his cuts to humanitarian aid. Just days before, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/bill-gates-give-away-fortune-by-2045-200bn-worlds-poorest-2025-05-08/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; had accused the world’s richest person of “killing the world’s poorest children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one especially fraught exchange with Bloomberg interviewer Mishal Husain, Musk rebuked a question about whether his cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; had imperiled HIV/Aids programs and claimed he would “fix it right now” if any services had, in fact, been defunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“First of all, the program, the Aids medication program, is continuing. So, your fundamental premise is wrong. It is continuing,” Musk said. “It is false. It’s false. It’s false.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rather than Musk’s cuts leaving HIV/Aids programs intact, however, global health officials said that Doge’s efforts have in reality hampered their work worldwide and thrown the protection of large swaths of people from disease into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="doges-dismantling-of-usaid-plunges-aids-services-into-chaos" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Doge’s dismantling of USAID plunges Aids services into chaos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to Doge’s cuts and the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, the US was involved in a wide range of HIV/Aids treatment and prevention programs across dozens of countries. The government implemented the majority of its operations through Pepfar, a USAID-funded program that has contributed more than $110bn to preventing and treating the virus since the initiative began in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since Doge dismantled USAID in January, however, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;future of Pepfar is uncertain&lt;/a&gt;, and many of its services are in jeopardy. A temporary waiver from the state department has allowed funding for some HIV/Aids programs to continue, but only those aimed at treating people who are already living with HIV, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, many prevention programs involving pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs, or Prep, ground to a halt without US funding. Even services that were allowed, such as testing and treatment, also stopped due to the disruption and confusion caused by Doge’s shutdown of USAID, according to the &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1159901#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20individuals%20%2D%20women%2C%20young%20girls%2C,for%20HIV%20prevention%2C%20screenings%20for%20tuberculosis%20or" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. People who showed up to receive testing or medicine often found that no one was there to give it to them, according to a UN health official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There were thousands of healthcare workers and community health workers, laboratorians and data clerks, for example, that immediately stopped work,” said Dr Angeli Achrekar, deputy executive director of the programme branch at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a former Pepfar official. “It’s not like you just turn on the light switch and all of a sudden these services start up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The effects of the cuts have been almost immediate, according to Achrekar, and could roll back years of advancements in combating HIV infections. In Botswana, the number of people receiving Prep has decreased by half since last year. The 30,000 people in Mozambique who were receiving Prep at the end of last year recently went down to 19,000, according to a UN tally. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving Prep declined from 4,000 to 1,800 in the same time frame. In Nigeria, 850,000 condoms distributed in December went down to 300,000 by February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s country after country,” Achrekar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-miracle-drug-cast-into-uncertainty" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;A miracle drug cast into uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The cuts to prevention programs have also caused confusion and uncertainty around the rollout of a highly anticipated new drug called Lenacapivir. The drug, which is under review at the US Food and Drug Administration, protects patients against HIV infection through a single shot given every six months. Two &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;separate large trials&lt;/a&gt; across different populations have shown that it almost entirely blocks the risk of contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-16" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections,” Achrekar said. “It is the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in the HIV response.” Other researchers have called it a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pepfar announced at the end of last year that it was partnering with The Global Fund, an international organization that finances global health programs, in an effort to roll out Lenacapivir to at least 2 million people within the next three years. Doge’s cuts have thrown a potential wrench in those plans, however, since the drug would fall under the category of preventative services that the tate department’s waiver says should no longer be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the Qatar Economic Forum this week, Musk insisted that medication programs were continuing, and, when confronted with the example of Lenacapivir, suggested he would restore its funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Which ones aren’t being funded? I’ll fix it right now,” Musk claimed, later adding: “If in fact this is true, which I doubt it is, then we’ll fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to Musk’s comments, UNAIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/may/20250521_PR_Musk_HIV_services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it was encouraged that he would review the crisis caused by halts to US funding. Musk has made similar pledges about restoring health programs that Doge cut in the past, however: in February, Musk said that efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola had been accidentally canceled but were then restored – a claim that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID officials said was false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the Global Fund waits to see what the Trump administration decides to do with Pepfar, it is hoping to carry on with its plans for Lenacapivir whether the US is involved or not. Losing Pepfar’s partnership would mean a huge decrease in funding, however, as well as Pepfar’s extensive connections to organizations that could help in administering the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not backing off the ambition to deliver Lenacapivir to two million people if we can,” said Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund. “The extent to which we can continue to do that in partnership with Pepfar is uncertain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the waiver was issued on 1 February there has been no clarity or new policy released on what the Trump administration plans to do with Pepfar. US partners working on prevention services have had their agreements terminated, while UNAIDS projects that if Pepfar’s treatment and prevention services are stopped entirely, it would result in an additional 6.6m HIV infections by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE10bkhxME1tTzMyWF82b0RNblRPSWMyVjR4SnlLV3RPME01NW1ZZnRvblgyeTd5S1M1LXZPZDF1amxHZnZyRXhmd19WNm5CdG9pbnRYcmhoQ2xGdHNKOFRWOVdVZjhZZ3BLbFo3X2ZWdDIwVVB4</guid></item><item><title>我搬家时扔掉的8件塑料厨房用品，以及我要用什么来代替它们- EatingWell | The 8 Plastic Kitchen Items I’m Ditching While I Move, Plus What I’m Replacing Them With - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9oVG44cllLQnFqR3pfMmUwdGxpdzhJUDVONmVoSktsNFdmdjR1QS1KY1F5Vll6S0piTVk4MUd3ak5hZ2d2VjhhMDM3S094dVoycjRJQzRpdzhDOHlERlpVRDRINUk3WEVTaEh5VzFjN1ZMcFRib1BfTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a health-conscious person working in food media, I am painfully aware of the various studies that come out about the materials we use in the kitchen. In the last year, I’ve learned that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/banned-flame-retardants-found-in-cooking-utensils-8723612" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;black plastic spatulas likely leach a lot of microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into our food, and scientists have discovered them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-limit-microplastics-in-your-food-11713723" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in the human brain&lt;/a&gt; (yikes!).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, I am not the kind of person to immediately overhaul all of my things—who has the budget for that these days? It just so happens that I’m moving, and it’s the perfect opportunity to make a few swaps that could transform my kitchen. The good news is that most of these items are below $35, so it’s a little easier to do. (That’s what I’m telling myself, at least.) If you want to join me on this non-toxic journey, here are the plastic-free swaps I’ll be making.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Silicone is different and more durable than plastic and likely poses less risk of releasing microplastics. These Stasher bags are great because I can replace the plastic single-use versions. Since they’re reusable, they’ll save me money and time at the grocery store. When we tested these&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-reusable-food-storage-bags-8745585" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; reusable bags&lt;/a&gt;, we found them incredibly sturdy with tight seals, keeping whatever we put in them fresh. Because of that, I know they’ll be reliable for the wide range of uses I already grab plastic bags for. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those plastic produce bags at the store are easy and convenient to use, but it’s time I stopped. Plastic aside, it’s wasteful. I live in New Jersey, where we have no choice but to bring our reusable shopping bags to the store because of an enacted law (I’m not complaining, I love this rule!), so why not add some produce bags into the mix? I plan to buy these cotton ones because they’re washable and reasonably priced. This set of six comes with three different-sized bags, which I appreciate. The drawstring at the top makes it easy to close but not impossible to re-open, which is another feature I love. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glass mason jars are a classic for a reason: They’re versatile, easy to wash and last for ages. Plus, the lid’s double seal keeps ingredients fresh. I plan to stock up on a few more, that way I have them on hand to use instead of quart and pint containers, whether I’m storing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8045254/tomato-puree-vs-tomato-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tomato sauce&lt;/a&gt; or packing away &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8049010/high-protein-grains-to-add-to-your-pantry/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pantry grains&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another silicone option, this GIR set is a realistic replacement for black plastic kitchen utensils. It’ll provide the ease and softness of the plastic without the risk. I already own a spatula from GIR, and use it frequently because of its perfect balance of strength and flexibility. Plus, the design is streamlined and fuss-free to clean by hand. This set has five tools, including everyday essentials like a turner and a ladle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love these&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-glass-food-storage-containers-8387775" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; glass containers&lt;/a&gt; and have a fresh set on the way! They’re just the best at-home storage option. They’re durable, stain- and odor-resistant and can go in the microwave. My favorite thing of all is how easy the lids are to clean. There are no gaskets, nooks or crannies—a wash with a sponge or brush gets it like new in a jiffy. There’s nothing less motivating than having containers that are so hard to clean; I think it’s why many of us reach for easier plastic containers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is an investment, but one I am sure will be worth it. My favorite material to cook with is enameled cast-iron, and I want to replace more of my nonstick pieces with it. Not all nonstick is bad—the ones with Teflon and PFAs or PFOAs contain plastic. Enameled cast-iron retains heat, sears foods with a golden brown finish and it’s easy to clean. And I know Le Creuset is durable and long-lasting, because my family owns and still uses&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-dutch-ovens-8383245" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Dutch ovens&lt;/a&gt; from the brand that are over 20 years old. This braiser has all the elements I need: The surface area at the bottom is wide enough for searing. Thanks to its walls, I don’t need to worry about food flying out of the pan and can use it for sauces. Lastly, the domed lid gives me wiggle room for those moments when I pile in just a little too much kale.
