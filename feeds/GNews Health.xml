&lt;h2&gt;Diet downsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims are lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499830/"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK599559/"&gt;prurigo pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt;. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/drp/1993385"&gt;a review this month&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

Bacopa Monnieri&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert considers bacopa monnieri, or bacopa in short, as a less popular but extremely beneficial supplement.

NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Nicotinamide mononucleotide is a supplement that is becoming increasingly popular, as per Robert, who explains it as “a precursor to an important energy source” for both the body and the brain called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;New research shows that a reduction of NAD in the brain is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” shared Robert, adding that substances like NMN that increase NAD in the brain can help improve brain function and memory, and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone loves sardines, but they work well in salads and pasta dishes. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249244/honey-soy-broiled-salmon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Honey-Soy Broiled Salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944627/garlic-anchovy-pasta-with-broccolini/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Garlic-Anchovy Pasta with Broccolini&lt;/a&gt; are two other yummy ways to get your omega-3's.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries deliver an antioxidant punch. "Whatever the mix—raspberries, blueberries, blackberries—just eat a serving of berries," says Moore. "They're a rich source of antioxidants, and they also provide a good dose of fiber, a key component of the diet that older men are frequently missing." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries get their color from flavonoids, including anthocyanins, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help reduce inflammation and disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The compounds in berries may also help keep hearts healthy by improving cholesterol, specifically decreasing LDL or "bad" cholesterol levels.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Eat them as is, or throw them in some Greek yogurt with a little granola for crunch," advises Moore. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8031379/dietitian-favorite-recipes-with-frozen-berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Frozen berries are a great option&lt;/a&gt; to save some money and always keep berries on hand. They work well in smoothies and in these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberry-pie-inspired-overnight-oats-11721962" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Blueberry Pie-Inspired Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans and legumes may not be top of mind, but they are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;part of an anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; and contain many plant compounds that help reduce inflammation.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Mohr notes,&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "The unsung hero of the nutrition world is fiber, and beans top the list as one of the best sources of fiber, among other nutrients as well." Hitting your fiber goals “can drastically lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and more," he adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans add a source of plant-based protein and can help improve the diversity of your gut microbiome, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The polyphenols in beans have antioxidant properties to help keep you healthy. Eating beans may also help with weight loss.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mohr notes, "Beans are versatile, inexpensive and can complement almost any dish." Try them in soups, salads, casseroles and in this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-vegetable-breakfast-grain-bowl-8742347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-cruciferous-vegetables"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Cruciferous Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Cruciferous vegetables, which include broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, are a good source of antioxidants and fiber," shares Moore. They're known for their key flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, which help reduce inflammation. Cruciferous veggies, in particular, when eaten as part of a balanced diet, are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegan-vegetarian-cancer-risk-study-11790465" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked to reduced cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. That includes colorectal cancer and prostate cancer, two of the most common cancers in men.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moore likes roasting his veggies in the oven or in the air fryer with some salt and cheese. There are so many ways to enjoy more cruciferous vegetables: add kale to a salad, cabbage to stir-fry or add them to a soup, stew or curry like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/slow-cooker-cauliflower-chickpea-tikka-masala-8580545" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Slow-Cooker Cauliflower &amp;amp; Chickpea Tikka Masala&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mohr likes oats because they contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-foods-to-help-lower-cholesterol-11770161" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber, which helps reduce your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber is important for your health in many ways, and it helps reduce inflammation because of what it does in your gut. Eating more fiber from whole grains, including oats, increases the production of short-chain fatty acids in your colon, which feed your gut bacteria, helps reduce your risk of colon cancer, and reduces inflammation in the gut.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber helps keep your blood sugar steadier, which can reduce oxidative stress from glucose spikes, and in turn tamps inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Oats also contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory compounds, like avenanthramides&lt;/a&gt;, to help reduce oxidative stress in the body.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "They can be soaked overnight and enjoyed in the morning, cooked, or eaten raw, with milk and berries," adds Mohr.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manage stress: "&lt;/strong&gt;Uncontrolled and unmanaged stress is well studied and fairly destructive at the cellular level. Long-term, it can even contribute to chronic illness," notes Moore. "I tell men all the time, build and maintain appropriate outlets that help you manage your stress, whether that’s exercise, sports or engaging in hobbies."&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Research links exercise with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908639/the-fastest-way-to-reduce-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing chronic low-grade inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Find movement that you enjoy and commit to staying active. That might look like walking, swimming, cycling, jogging, lifting weights or yoga. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: It's recommended to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night but about a third of Americans aren't getting enough sleep. Falling short on sleep not only leaves you feeling tired, it can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce your risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Turn off screens before bed, limit caffeine in the afternoon and try to establish a healthy evening routine to be sure you're getting enough shut-eye.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; While the occasional beer or glass of wine isn't likely to do much harm, drinking alcohol can cause oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Keep your alcoholic drinks to a minimum for your overall health and for the most anti-inflammatory diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might feel overwhelming to start making changes to your diet, but there's no need for an overhaul. Start small by adding a handful of berries to breakfast or making oatmeal a few times a week. "It’s never too late to start," adds Moore. "There’s still plenty of life ahead of you. Make a simple change today, do it again tomorrow, and keep that practice going until it becomes habitual."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these anti-inflammatory foods can benefit everyone, they may be especially important for men over 50 to help improve gut health, heart health and reduce the risk of certain cancers. When you think of an overall diet to reduce inflammation, aim to eat a variety of colorful plant foods and a well-balanced diet. And it's not about perfection. "The most important factor is consistency with any lifestyle habit, whether it is a dietary change, lifestyle change or other," notes Mohr.

Probably. According to the NHS, many UK adults spend upwards of nine hours each day sitting down. But too much sitting could seriously damage your health, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sitting-for-long-stretches-raises-heart-and-diabetes-risks"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from Brunel University – even if you meet weekly &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We reviewed the published evidence available regarding associations between sedentary behaviour [sitting or lying down] and different risk markers for &lt;a href="/topic/heart-disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 60 and above,” says sedentary behaviour specialist Dr Daniel Bailey who is, perhaps predictably, stationed at a standing desk during our video call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review found that people who sat down for large chunks of their day were far more likely to have a higher waist circumference and body fat levels. They also recorded worse readings for several biomarkers linked to heart disease and diabetes, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides and cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those risks were there regardless of the amount of physical activity these older adults were engaging in,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much sitting is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people spend upwards of eight hours at a desk each day. Add in the journey home from work and sofa time watching telly, and it’s easy to see how daily sitting times are so high for many of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the past few decades, we’ve seen all of this technology come into play, which gives us more opportunities to sit down,” Dr Bailey says. “With that, we have seen a massive increase in obesity and the diseases that come with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data suggests older populations are the most sedentary group, and it is this demographic that will likely experience the greatest benefits from cutting down their daily sitting time. However, Dr Bailey adds, “It is an important consideration for all ages,” with studies on children and working-age adults also linking excessive sitting to increased health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some studies show the threshold is somewhere between seven and 10 hours of sitting per day being too much,” Dr Bailey tells me. “That’s where your risk of early mortality and several different diseases really starts to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-for-longevity-b2826608.html"&gt;The science-backed exercise method that can help fight the effects of ageing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you move less, you burn less energy during the day, which can contribute to weight gain. Muscles can lose strength when unused, joints can become stiff, and because you are asking less of your heart and lungs each day, fitness can fade away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bcLYNA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Many people spend nine hours or more of their day sitting down, according to the NHS" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264724"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Many people spend nine hours or more of their day sitting down, according to the NHS&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the negative effects of excessive sedentary time are linked to the amount of time you spend sitting down at a time. “There have been a number of studies that show the benefits of breaking up your sedentary time every 30 to 60 minutes,” explains. Dr Bailey added that the mechanism behind this is not yet fully understood. He describes it as a series of “metabolic switches that help regulate blood sugar, glucose levels and cholesterol levels.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not doing regular muscular contractions, these metabolic switches switch off. That’s when we get higher levels of glucose in the blood, higher cholesterol in the blood, and our blood pressure isn’t as well regulated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10000-steps-walking-workout-heart-health-b2886117.html"&gt;If you struggle to walk 10,000 steps a day, a scientist recommends trying this instead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to fight back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary ways to fight the negative effects of sitting down is to do less of it, and to ensure you are getting regular muscular contractions – ie using your muscles and moving. Based on his research, Dr Bailey prescribes trying to move in some form every 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Regular muscular contractions – through moving or simply standing up – can combat the negative effects of too much sitting" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264725"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Regular muscular contractions – through moving or simply standing up – can combat the negative effects of too much sitting&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every movement counts,” he says. “We’ve published a lot of studies in our group that show how regular, short bouts of light activity keep these metabolic switches turned on, and your blood sugar levels and cholesterol stay lower throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t need to be structured exercise. Simply standing up seems to be beneficial in people that are overweight, obese or have type two diabetes. We’ve also looked at slow walking – people can get these metabolic benefits from things we do in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every half an hour, get up, move around for a few minutes, and that should help reduce your risk of the different diseases we’ve discussed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-heart-health-b2859776.html"&gt;The science-backed two-minute daily workouts for improving heart health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another easy change Dr Bailey suggests is reorganising your workstation to encourage more movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changing your setup so not everything is at hand can help,” he explains. “If you need a pen, to print something or put something in the bin, having those things located away from your desk might encourage you to move more often. And rather than sending a colleague an email, go and talk to them at their desk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iLHiBm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Daniel Bailey recommends moving for a few minutes every half an hour where possible" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264726"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Dr Daniel Bailey recommends moving for a few minutes every half an hour where possible&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also make a conscious effort to move after you finish certain tasks at your computer, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you might ignore an alert to move from your wearable or an app because you are working on something. Instead, wait until the end of a task, then use that as your cue to get up and move around. If you’re working from home, you could spread your housework across the day rather than doing it in one big chunk, and use these opportunities to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reap the benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the results of reducing your daily sitting time and making even these small tweaks are pretty remarkable. “If we can limit our sedentary time and be physically active, we’re going to live a longer and healthier life, which is what I think we’re all striving for,” says Dr Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benefits you might see and feel quite quickly are [a] better mood, more energy and less fatigue. Then, in the longer term, you might start to see reductions in body fat or body weight because you are burning more calories from movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The deeper impacts won’t be as obvious, but you could benefit from a reduction in blood sugar levels and a reduction in blood pressure. That will help reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/heart-health-attack-cardio-exercise-b2785415.html"&gt;A cardiac nurse says these five daily behaviours can reduce your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQM3ZmU291bUhjUFRiX0kwQUJsTDUtVFJybVlJR2MxbUlENW1yTnRQUENtZlMwYVBSMkRUWE5xeUUyMWlVcURISU5HUTkwNjk3dVFfNm15SFBNMWFRYmEybkxwYk55WmFkYkRySW1RS0FoaUVJMlM3dGRzOTR5VHU2WTNwSFRhZ2lLWXhUcWdtMkhWN09rWk51SDRlNzFqM2lTS0RKNjA2VXpGQQ</guid></item><item><title>官员说，感染麻疹的成年人在传染期间访问了克拉克县的高中- kptv.com</title><link>https://www.kptv.com/2026/01/24/adult-with-measles-visited-high-school-clark-county-while-contagious-county-officials-say/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;RIDGEFIELD, Wash.

&lt;p&gt;City and county health officials’ detection of a &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2026/01/13/eighth-harrison-lepto-outbreak-northwest-berkeley-bhu"&gt;leptospirosis outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in and around a longstanding &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/06/04/berkeley-eighth-harrison-homeless-encampment-sweep"&gt;Northwest Berkeley homeless encampment&lt;/a&gt; has many in the neighborhood worried about what it means for them and their pets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians found leptospirosis in two dogs within the encampment around Eighth and Harrison streets, both in November, one of which died, and later detected the illness in &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2017/01/19/rats-chew-car-wires-enter-homes-in-berkeley-hills-causing-costly-damage"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in five years in Alameda County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the Jan. 12 announcement there were no known human cases. City officials did not respond to Berkeleyside’s inquiries, sent Thursday, as to whether that has changed. County officials said that they are continuing “to monitor the area and trap rats,” and “to provide support to the residents of the encampment on their rodent issues.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacterial pathogen, rare in the developed world, is treatable with antibiotics, and there are vaccines for dogs and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Berkeleyside has compiled some information on the disease and its risks from public health and veterinary medicine experts, as well as city health officials.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-just-how-dangerous-is-leptospirosis"&gt;Just how dangerous is leptospirosis?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC there are only about 1 million human cases of leptospirosis a year, most of those in developing countries and primarily in tropical climates, since the bacterium thrives in wet environments. Of those cases about 60,000 end up becoming fatal. In 90%of cases, humans and animals recover without any treatment, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However uncommon in the United States and other wealthier countries, untreated cases of leptospirosis can lead to kidney and liver failure, meningitis and death. And because it is so rare, and its symptoms so common to other illnesses, doctors and veterinarians sometimes do not think to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most people who are exposed don’t get it — only about 10% get symptoms,” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told Berkeleyside in a phone interview. And of that 10% who develop symptoms, only 10% — or about 1 in 100 people exposed — develop severe symptoms, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The illness can be more dangerous to people who are immunocompromised or have diabetes, liver disease or kidney disease, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In pregnant people the bacterium can pose a deadly risk to fetuses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-catch-leptospirosis-and-how"&gt;Who can catch leptospirosis, and how?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A map from Berkeley health officials puts the epicenter of the outbreak at Eighth and Harrison streets. The “red zone,” or most at-risk parts of the neighborhood, are Harrison Street from Cedarwood Lane to 10th Street and two blocks each of Eighth, Ninth and 10th streets, one each on either side of Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lower-risk “yellow zone,” radiating out ⅓ of a mile from Eighth and Harrison, “there is no evidence of active transmission of leptospirosis or of unmitigated rat populations,” according to the Jan. 12 announcement. “However, proximity to the encampment red zone creates risk and need for prevention efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is zoonotic — meaning it can jump between species — but is not airborne, and not transmitted by coughing or sneezing. The most common route of transmission is by way of urine from infected animals, either directly or by way of contaminating water or mud. If animals drink contaminated standing water, or if the bacterium comes in contact with cuts or mucous membranes (eyes, mouths, noses) on people and animals, they can contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The illness can spread by bites that break skin, or pass from infected mothers to their young. The bacterium can also linger on plants that have come into contact with contaminated water or mud, making it prudent to wash anything harvested in contaminated areas. While the bacterium can persist for months on end in contaminated water, it typically dies off when puddles and pools dry out, and is &lt;a href="https://www.nhsborders.scot.nhs.uk/media/197827/Leptospirosis-June-2014.pdf"&gt;susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to disinfectants and heat over 112 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wild animals that come into contact with the bacterium are at risk, but dogs are generally regarded as the most common domesticated animal to contract it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats, too, can contract leptospirosis, though compared with dogs, frequently show much milder symptoms or no symptoms at all. But while the illness might not hurt a cat directly, an infected cat can continue to shed the bacterium for years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis can also spread to livestock and marine mammals. Sea lion populations along the California coast generally see surges of the illness every three to five years, though there was an unexpected surge in cases this summer, &lt;a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-sea-lions-sick-deadly-bacterial-disease-transmissible-humans-pets"&gt;KTVU reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-prevent-transmission"&gt;How do I prevent transmission?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While there is no human vaccine, there is a canine vaccine for leptospirosis — an initial series of two shots followed by annual boosters. There are also vaccines for cats, cows, goats, sheep, pigs and horses. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pets/index.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; vaccinating all animals possible “even if they get leptospirosis because the vaccine might cover different strains, and it may help avoid more severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said folks passing through the area should cover open wounds and take other common-sense precautions like washing hands, but “people don’t have to worry about casual pedestrian exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While people probably should not wade into the creek, nor play in puddles, “I think they don’t have to worry about it too much, not to be too panicked about it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For unhoused people living in the area, the greatest risk is to their dogs. Chin-Hong recommended they keep their pets leashed, get pets vaccinated where possible and use hand sanitizer if and when running water is not available to clean and disinfect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-symptoms-and-treatment-for-leptospirosis-for-humans-dogs-and-cats"&gt;What are the symptoms and treatment for leptospirosis for humans, dogs and cats?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most prominent signs that dogs are infected are fever, muscle tenderness and lethargy, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). “Other signs may include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice … inflammation of the eyes, bloody nose, urine or stool and changes in the amount and frequency of urination,” according to the organization’s page on the illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In humans, the bacterium brings on fever, headache, chills, body aches, jaundice, red eyes, stomach pain, rashes, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Because so many of these symptoms mimic other illnesses, leptospirosis is frequently mistaken for something else, and some people never show symptoms at all, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans generally become ill sometime between two and 30 days after contact, though symptoms most commonly present five to 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC. Patients typically experience flu-like symptoms in the first phase of illness, but may also enter a second, more severe phase that could bring on kidney or liver failure or meningitis, or inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors and veterinarians can test for leptospirosis in patients’ blood and urine. In humans and animals, the disease is treatable with antibiotics. Some veterinary experts &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/leptospirosis"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that early detection is crucial in dogs to prevent permanent liver or kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said that because leptospirosis is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it might fall to patients or pet owners to bring it up with doctors and veterinarians.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-guidance-does-the-berkeley-health-department-give"&gt;What guidance does the Berkeley health department give?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Health, Housing and Community Services Department has issued a series of recommendations for those who live, work or visit in the area that may be contaminated:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are camped in the area, move at least a third of a mile away&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;RVs and other vehicles with long-term rat infestations should be destroyed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean all “non-porous” property — bicycles, tools, hardware and so on — by removing all visible mud and debris with soap and water and then disinfecting with a 10-to-1 bleach-water solution, leaving it on for at least 10 minutes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Destroy any “contaminated soft goods” like blankets or tents that have been on the ground&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Throw out any food, beverages or water with which rats may have come into contact&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If coming into contact with mud or standing water in the encampment, or with items that were previously exposed to them, wear masks, waterproof boots, eye protection and nitrile or rubber gloves; do not let mud, runoff or water touch skin, mouths, noses, or eyes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treat creek water, puddles and any other standing water in the area as contaminated; do not walk or bike through standing water or the creek&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate dogs and free-roaming cats; keep pets on short leashes; bring water for walks and do not let pets drink from other sources&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When gardening, wear gloves and protective foot coverings&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wash any fruits and vegetables harvested in the area before consuming&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If you think your pet has been exposed to leptospirosis, or is showing signs of illness, contact your veterinarian immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lawrence sees early flu peak as some health care providers require masking&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six viral diseases — including COVID-19, the flu and norovirus — have been found at high concentrations in Lawrence wastewater as Kansas communities face peak flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, influenza A and B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and norovirus have all been detected at high concentrations in Lawrence &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4niF8mr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; within the last three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lawre-507379751df59046d9a030f03d59d14c lawre-content_2" id="lawre-507379751df59046d9a030f03d59d14c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data indicates trends of illnesses spreading within a community but does not correlate to exact case numbers, with doctors saying it’s normal to see high concentrations of respiratory illness during flu season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater data does not measure individual cases, but it provides a reliable picture of how much virus is circulating in a community,” said Veronica White, preparedness and epidemiology coordinator for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health. “This data captures viral genetic material shed by everyone using the sewer system. One factor that may be contributing to the higher concentrations of respiratory viruses seen in Lawrence’s wastewater is its larger population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawrence is also seeing an early peak in influenza B compared to the rest of the country. Positive flu tests spiked the last week of 2025, with 32% of total flu tests coming back positive, according to data from the University of Kansas Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health care providers such as Watkins Health Center at the University of Kansas are requiring masks for all visitors, patients and staff due to a “record surge in respiratory illnesses,” according to a sign at the front door.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White said early rise in the flu doesn’t indicate a more dangerous flu season, but rather earlier circulation of the virus than usual. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this trend early through wastewater data allows people to take preventive steps, such as getting vaccinated, monitoring symptoms, and staying home when sick,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data also indicated that a newer strain of COVID, known as the XFG or the Stratus variant, has accounted for 82.5% of positive COVID samples, with concentrations increasing by 25% in the last month. The variant has also been increasing nationally, White said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana Hawkinson, medical director for Infection Control and Prevention program at University of Kansas Health System, said there are still large populations of people across the state who have not received a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There have been a large number of people ill and circulators too in our communities. But (the flu) still remains at a high level at this point in time,” Hawkinson said. “There have been extremely low numbers of people not getting the vaccine. We know that we can help prevent this and people’s chances of severe illness and death with it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve Stites, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, said that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7chEnUW0EI?si=2KN1bC2byLQI_f0H&amp;amp;t=678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said flu symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, body aches and a sore throat rather than stomach bug symptoms, with the definitions often getting mixed up during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="lawre-c9b79c6582bb301aaf6b39082e01c8ce lawre-bonus-banners" id="lawre-c9b79c6582bb301aaf6b39082e01c8ce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data has also indicated that Salina is seeing medium concentrations of the same illnesses, except for influenza A, which is considered to be at a high concentration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on the data, we expect viral activity to continue in both Lawrence and Salina over the next few weeks,” White said. “As we move through flu season, we anticipate seeing elevated influenza activity reflected in the wastewater, especially as the season approaches its typical peak.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical experts continue to advise washing hands, covering coughs and not going into large public spaces when sick to prevent illnesses from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can still go get the flu vaccine,” Hawkinson said. “It’s still recommended, and you can do it now to protect yourself from infection.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to exercising for your heart's sake, you don't want to peak too early in life.

But most people with high blood pressure don't even know they have it – hence why it's often called the "silent killer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are ways to turn high blood pressure around: exercise is the focus of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,100 adults were recruited for the study, which tracked their health over three decades through physical assessments and questionnaires on exercise habits, smoking status, and alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each clinical assessment, blood pressure was measured three times, 1 minute apart, and, for data analysis, participants were grouped into four categories by race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the board – amongst men, women, and in both racial groups – levels of physical activity slumped from 18 to 40 years of age, with rates of hypertension rising and physical activity falling over subsequent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-change-to-your-standing-desk-could-make-workdays-healthier"&gt;young adulthood is an important window for intervening&lt;/a&gt; to prevent midlife hypertension with health promotion programs designed to boost exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 5-Minute Workout Each Day Can Still Make a Huge Health Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly half of our participants in young adulthood had suboptimal levels of physical activity, which was significantly associated with the onset of hypertension, indicating that we need to raise the minimum standard for physical activity," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; lead author Jason Nagata, a UCSF expert in young adult medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_80404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-80404" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-642x260.jpg" alt="Someone lifting a dumbbell behind their head" class="wp-image-80404 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-80404" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Physical activity often declines with age, but this can have consequences for your health. (Watchara Piriyaputtanapun/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked at people who had done 5 hours of moderate exercise a week during early adulthood – double the minimum amount currently recommended for adults – they found that this level of activity lowered the risk of hypertension considerably, especially if people maintained their exercise habits until age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Achieving at least twice the current minimum adult [physical activity] guidelines may be more beneficial for the prevention of hypertension than simply meeting the minimum guidelines," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.018"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not easy to step up physical activity each week amid life-changing decisions and growing responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This might be especially the case after high school when opportunities for physical activity diminish as young adults transition to college, the workforce, and parenthood, and leisure time is eroded," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-all-sitting-is-equal-one-type-was-just-linked-to-better-brain-health"&gt;Not All Sitting Is Equal.

			&lt;p&gt;Many of the body's processes slow down or falter as we get older, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/body-resurrects-cells-marked-for-death-solving-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;tissue regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. In a new study, researchers detail a promising method to get this vital repair work back up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from a team at the University of California, San Francisco, identified four &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt; – proteins that control the activity of other genes – that have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-way-to-recharge-aging-human-cells"&gt;rejuvenating effect&lt;/a&gt; on cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers boosted production of one of these transcription factors in the liver cells of elderly mice, they noticed numerous benefits: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-daily-habits-could-be-causing-your-liver-serious-harm"&gt;fat and scarring&lt;/a&gt; were significantly reduced, and glucose tolerance improved – all signs of a more youthful organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-reveals-crucial-differences"&gt;Blood of Exceptionally Long-Lived People Reveals Crucial Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tinkered with the levels of all four transcription factors in lab-grown human &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"&gt;fibroblast cells&lt;/a&gt;. Fibroblasts make up connective tissue and provide scaffolding around other cells and organs. Again, multiple signs of youthfulness were spotted as a result, including increased cell division and boosted energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By altering gene expression using the transcription factors we identified, old fibroblasts behaved as if they were younger, and improved the health of old mice," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Hao Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188901" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg" alt="Liver scarring diagram" class="wp-image-188901 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring-600x419.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Increasing the expression of EZH2 (bottom row), one of four transcription factors identified, reduced liver scarring (blue stain) in older mice compared to controls (top row). (Sengstack et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the four key transcription factors, the researchers first compared old and young human fibroblast cells using a computational model to see how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hundreds-of-genes-act-differently-in-male-vs-female-brains-scientists-discover"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; differed with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having drawn up a shortlist of 200 transcription factors that could be controlling the 'youthfulness' of cells, they began systematically toggling them on and off – changing the transcription factors produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this tinkering led the researchers to the final four transcription factors that they tested in more detail: E2F3, EZH2, STAT3, and ZFX. Altering the levels of these factors in liver cells of mice and human fibroblast cells grown in plastic dishes shifted the cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-restore-aging-blood-stem-cells-to-a-more-youthful-state-in-mice"&gt;towards a younger mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these proteins had an effect across two different species and cell types suggests we could be looking at a universal blueprint of sorts, one that could be broadly applied to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-immune-cells-partly-reverse-alzheimers-symptoms-in-mice"&gt;reactivate youthful states&lt;/a&gt; in older cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest a shared set of molecular requirements for cellular and tissue rejuvenation across species," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, and we're not yet talking about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gains-in-human-life-expectancy-may-have-already-passed-their-peak"&gt;extending lifespans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/axolotl-discovery-brings-us-closer-than-ever-to-regrowing-human-limbs"&gt;replacing limbs&lt;/a&gt; or rejuvenating the whole body. We only have the results from a few cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term safety needs to be considered, too. The experiments in mice lasted only a few weeks, so we still don't know what effects rejuvenating cells in this manner might have over extended periods. Too much cell growth connected to EZH2 has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1933744100"&gt;linked with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with a global population that's growing older and living longer, potential ways of keeping our bodies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;healthier for longer&lt;/a&gt; should warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work opens up exciting new opportunities to understand and ultimately reverse aging-related diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Janine Sengstack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The paper, based on a review of 25 cluster cases, found that the patients had all suffered from known and diagnosable illnesses including cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The lead author of the JAMA paper, Dr Anthony Lang, told the BBC on Friday that the provincial report "confirms our suspicion or belief that there was no environmental factor that could have accounted for such a broad range of neurological problems". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There was no consistent neurological disease that we had seen in this small group of patients we described," Lang added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So this just confirms exactly what we've suspected and really emphasises the suffering and pain that patients and families have had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nesbitt and other patients have rejected accusations that Marrero has misdiagnosed patients, and said he rightfully raised concerns about their test results of elevated metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She added some patients have expressed they do not want to see another neurologist "because they don't trust anybody anymore".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He's a kind man, he's intelligent, he does due diligence," Nesbitt said, adding that he has done a considerable amount of testing on patients to help give them answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Friday's report. In September, he told the BBC that other senior federal and provincial scientists had also believed there was a novel syndrome in New Brunswick and that he was now being portrayed as the sole purveyor of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:01:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1VMzBWT2dPdmFsTTlfbUhfc3ZncVlEMlV3NGRhS3J3SU10TGkxRERiLXp1RVFzN1NPRzVBUnlKQmVkRmdZQ2JMdmM0ZWc2bHIxMjdBWmI5a3RPd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBwTFVWUjFHV0tkUG43M3NyRVFjc0d6N3c0aWU4ZF9xVU5BSWMtUjhib1ZYUC1hOEEtOW96Rk83cEZIQkRpN1NoNEY4YWpFYTE1bnBaUnFPU0JIZlEtdTlz</guid></item><item><title>湾区新增麻疹病例：如何检查疫苗接种状况和谁需要加强疫苗接种- KQED</title><link>https://www.kqed.org/news/12070907/measles-san-francisco-bay-area-2026-is-there-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-booster</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans who went to school in America will have both MMR vaccines completed, and then should be protected against the measles,” Napa public health officer Dr. Christine Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a combined Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella, or MMRV, vaccine, but it’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;only licensed&lt;/a&gt; for use in children between ages 1 to 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDPH &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/Questions-and-answers.html?name=question&amp;amp;tab=9"&gt;affirms&lt;/a&gt; that “MMR vaccines are very safe and effective,” and as with “any medicine, there can be side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that everyone over 12 months of age be vaccinated against measles, with children receiving the first of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;two doses of the MMR vaccine &lt;/a&gt;between 12 to 15 months of age. The second dose is recommended between 4 to 6 years of age. This vaccine provides lifetime protection against measles, so if you got your MMR vaccine as a child, you’re considered up-to-date on your vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CDC data from the 2023-24 school year, California has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;a 96.2% &lt;/a&gt;vaccination rate against measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If &lt;a id="booster"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’m up-to-date on my measles vaccines, do I need a measles booster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The CDC’s longtime advice says: If you had two doses of measles vaccine as a child according to the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html"&gt;vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC considers you “protected for life” and you “do not ever need a booster dose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, said Wu, the second dose of your MMR vaccine is actually considered your booster “that provides a lifelong immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, two groups of older adults who received childhood measles vaccinations but who should still talk to their health care provider about possibly getting another vaccination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People born between 1957 and 1969&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in this age group, which would make you between 56 and 68 years old today, it’s likely you only received one dose of the MMR vaccine and should consider getting a second dose, according to Bay Area health officers in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you were born before 1957?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, everyone born before this year is presumed to have&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt; immunity from measles &lt;/a&gt;from a previous infection, given how widespread the virus was during that period — although &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster"&gt;people &lt;/a&gt;in this age group who work in health care and who don’t have any written evidence of this immunity should get the MMR vaccine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who received the ‘killed’ measles vaccine between 1963 and 1967&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “killed,” or inactivated, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html#cdc_generic_section_1-protection-against-measles"&gt;measles vaccine &lt;/a&gt;was an earlier formulation of the measles vaccine that was only used for this brief period in the 1960s, for fewer than one million people. Because it was found to be ineffective and replaced with the current live vaccine, people who know they received this particular version of the vaccine “should talk to their health care provider about&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html#cdc_generic_section_1-protection-against-measles"&gt; getting revaccinated&lt;/a&gt;” with the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no harm in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html"&gt;getting another dose &lt;/a&gt;of MMR vaccine if you may already be immune to measles (or mumps or rubella),” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know if I’m vaccinated against measles. How can I check?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no national organization that maintains Americans’&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/vaccination-records.html"&gt; vaccination records&lt;/a&gt;. Ways that the CDC suggests to track down your own records include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your parents or caregivers for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/records/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/records/keeping-track.html"&gt;records &lt;/a&gt;of your childhood immunizations (or look in saved documents from your childhood, like baby books).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consult a state immunization registry like the California Department of Public Health’s &lt;a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/"&gt;Digital Vaccine Record &lt;/a&gt;portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your doctor or public health clinic, but remember that these records may only be stored for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/vaccination-records.html"&gt; has a guide &lt;/a&gt;to tracking down your vaccination records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason to check your vaccination status if you’re unsure: Possessing documentation of your vaccination status “can help you avoid being quarantined if you are exposed,” according to a 2025 advisory from Bay Area health officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you can’t find any sign that you or your family have received a measles vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Teenagers and adults with no evidence of immunity should be vaccinated right away,” they added — something the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/vaccination-records.html"&gt;CDC echoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your health provider can also order “a simple blood test,” said Wu, to check whether or not you are immune from measles, either from vaccination or from a childhood infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I’m vaccinated,&lt;a id="still"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; am I still at risk of getting measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years of living with COVID-19 have taught us that being vaccinated against a virus doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t get infected with that virus. The COVID-19 vaccine, for example, does somewhat reduce your chances of being infected — although the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/5-things-you-should-know.html"&gt; CDC said &lt;/a&gt;that “protection against infection tends to be modest and sometimes short-lived” — but it also means you’re much less likely to get severely ill if you do get infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the measles vaccine &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;incredibly effective at protecting against infections, the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html"&gt; CDC said&lt;/a&gt;, and two doses of measles vaccine are “about 97% effective” at preventing measles if you’re exposed. (One dose is “about 93% effective.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why “about three out of 100” people vaccinated against measles will still get measles after exposure — also known as breakthrough cases — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html"&gt;the CDC said &lt;/a&gt;that experts “aren’t sure why” and that this could be due to the responsiveness of an individual’s immune system to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the good news is, fully vaccinated people who get measles seem more likely to have a milder illness,” the CDC said — and fully vaccinated people “seem also less likely to spread the disease to other people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I find a measles vaccine in the Bay Area?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt; CDC’s &lt;/a&gt;recommendation of these shots means that your insurer should cover the costs. The CDC’s&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667199/cdc-vaccine-schedule-children"&gt; recent changes&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. vaccine schedule for children under the leadership of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. do not affect the agency’s recommendation of the MMR vaccine or insurance coverage of these shots. In 2025, Kennedy dissolved the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-chief-kennedy-names-new-members-vaccine-advisory-committee-2025-06-11/"&gt;replaced its members with a number of doctors and researchers &lt;/a&gt;who have repeatedly questioned, without evidence, the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find appointments for an MMR vaccine at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those without insurance: Uninsured children ages 18 and under can get free DTaP vaccines — and other no-cost immunizations — as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt;. People without insurance can get the MMR vaccine at a lower cost — or even free&lt;a href="https://eziz.org/assets/docs/IMM-1247.pdf"&gt; if they qualify &lt;/a&gt;for the Vaccines for Adults Program — from several providers and community clinics around the Bay Area, including:&lt;/p&gt;
