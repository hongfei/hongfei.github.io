&lt;p&gt;New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reveals that women who regularly consume caffeinated coffee during midlife may have better chances of maintaining overall health into their senior years. This groundbreaking study tracked thousands of women over three decades, offering compelling evidence that your daily coffee ritual might contribute to long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The remarkable connection between coffee and women’s healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a significant link between coffee consumption in middle-aged women and enhanced health outcomes later in life. The extensive research, presented at NUTRITION 2025 (the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting), followed 47,513 female participants from the Nurses’ Health Study over 30 years, gathering comprehensive dietary and health information since 1984.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the unique aspect of this investigation: &lt;em&gt;examining coffee’s influence across multiple domains of aging over an extended timeframe&lt;/em&gt;. “While past studies have connected coffee to individual health outcomes, ours is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” Dr. Mahdavi explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee—approximately 2-5 cups daily—was associated with a 2% to 5% higher likelihood of healthy aging. This positive correlation was specific to regular caffeinated coffee, with no significant benefits observed from decaffeinated varieties or tea consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women classified as “healthy agers” typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during midlife (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. More than 80% of this caffeine came specifically from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What defines “healthy aging” in this landmark study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers established comprehensive criteria to identify women who achieved “healthy aging” status. By 2016, 3,706 participants had met all requirements. To qualify as a healthy ager, women needed to demonstrate excellence across multiple health domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching age 70 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Freedom from 11 major chronic diseases&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintained physical functionality&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Good mental health status&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No cognitive impairment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Absence of memory complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;holistic approach to measuring successful aging&lt;/strong&gt; represents one of the study’s most valuable contributions to our understanding of long-term health trajectories in women. Rather than focusing on single health metrics, the research team evaluated how coffee consumption related to maintaining overall wellbeing across physical, mental, and cognitive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis carefully controlled for potential confounding factors, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake—ensuring that the observed benefits could be reasonably attributed to caffeine consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not all caffeine sources offer equal benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crucial finding from this research highlights that &lt;strong&gt;the source of caffeine matters significantly&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to potential health benefits. While caffeinated coffee showed positive associations with healthy aging, the same cannot be said for all caffeine-containing beverages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Beverage Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Association with Healthy Aging&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Approximate Effect&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Caffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Positive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-5% increased likelihood per cup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Decaffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cola/Soda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-26% decreased likelihood per serving&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking was the discovery that regular cola consumption showed a decidedly negative relationship with healthy aging prospects. Each additional small glass of soda was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that &lt;em&gt;the beneficial effects appear specific to coffee rather than caffeine itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction suggests that coffee’s unique composition—beyond just its caffeine content—may contribute to its apparent health benefits. Coffee contains numerous bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that could work synergistically to support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical implications for women’s health strategies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these findings show promise, Dr. Mahdavi cautions that coffee consumption should be viewed as just one component within a broader healthy lifestyle framework. “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” she noted, adding that “moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that the benefits observed from coffee consumption were relatively modest compared to the impact of overall lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and avoiding tobacco use. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that incorporating moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee into daily routines may complement other health-promoting practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For middle-aged women concerned about maintaining their vitality and cognitive function into later years, this research offers encouraging evidence that your morning cup of coffee might do more than just jumpstart your day—it could potentially contribute to a healthier aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal nature of this study—following participants for three decades—provides particularly robust evidence for these associations, though further research remains necessary to fully understand the biological mechanisms involved and to determine whether similar benefits might extend to other demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific papers as well as interviews with researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, the researchers found the food and agricultural industries to be the worst offenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute water and affect local ecosystems as well as the food we eat, and one of the most dangerous fertilizers is the sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants which is spread on fields even though it often contains many toxic chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that PFAS have now 'contaminated the whole world', with levels in rainwater often exceeding safe limits for drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern as research has shown they can infiltrate cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They note that despite the current level of evidence, there are still 'noticeable gaps' in how industry and regulatory bodies address chemical toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, they highlight how loopholes in regulation have allowed more than 200 new food additives into the food system without undergoing pre-market approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reveals that the number is closer to 900 and these additives get through the system through what is referred to as the 'generally recognized as safe,' or GRAS, loophole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The loophole lets those companies – not the FDA – decide when a substance is safe,' the expose notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'For the other 863 new food chemicals added to the food supply since 2000, food chemical companies exploited the GRAS loophole so they could make their own safety determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Deep Science Ventures report reveals that in the FDA's own database, almost 80 percent of chemical additives directly added to food 'lack the relevant information needed to estimate the amount that consumers can safely eat, and 93 percent lack reproductive or developmental toxicity data.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And of the FDA-regulated additives - both directly and indirectly allowed in food - almost two-thirds don't have publicly available data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the EU, even with a 'precautionary ethos, typically based on the 'no hazard data, no market' principle', they say there are still too many exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The majority of commonly used chemicals lack adequate public data for their long-term health and environmental impacts,' they add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the backs of the findings, the researchers called for policy makers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Underscoring the need for immediate action, the researchers concluded: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the backs of the findings, the researchers called for policy makers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Underscoring the need for immediate action, the researchers concluded: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives. This is important because human and planetary health is at stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For us to ensure our continued development and ability to thrive as a human species, we have to accelerate the growth of innovative, technological solutions and ensure these are funded and scaled at pace.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 19:56:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd0ZnUjMzbVBJRkNqUFl0Y3ZEd1BKaEt1ZU9uZWJ2RzZ3bVREd29DdVBnVnVFRUt1NFMtVWVkaG1ldlVocWdNbE5PWHFHWHhNQXFMU0dPbmdvaWd2WHV1VzhNSVlmQ2tjM0ltTDFQSlN4Si1KUmtGb21IUUZoZlpVbEQ5b2VVRDBqMG51SVBiNUF4Z2NRTUdvQjB1ZE9xekJPdU9WeHdMa9IBrAFBVV95cUxNXzNwOVJlUGxOWExaZl9nV2pjY0drRHI0SVNTSVdxUGFObEd6aFVic2hPSGRRU2RPZ1FaS0VFVnczQnYzbWVEaTZCallOc0hUWUtKeEpfdnZQd2d0Ym5uOUh5eVVXdXZxNkxNV3RXOC04a3J6czN6MUdtai1sRUVycnpXZlZYckRXd2ZPZ0FzTlpXYXVQamhpXzh0UWgzaW13SUFWZS1qU0ZkRVVn</guid></item><item><title>男子在接受ChatGPT的饮食建议后毒害自己- NewsNation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNLWFNalplVHBwVXJPOVZBVzNoMFFOZ2tXN0FfMEZWQVlUVThNWV9TbG5Qc3hqdlNyaUdWMUpUYlpYcUs2SFNFYUpnVzZ1MEFYM1V5NllNSnYyTTd5dW80V05waFFqWTV0YjNuUUpvQjdNZlpFTU5TYjM4cGJpSjdjMUpUZVdiell5dmFwbURyNNIBlAFBVV95cUxPQXZUQ1ZDYmRrWnI0RE1adGl2QWRkRk1ZMFZDYkctcmd0Z0FvNWp4bllxdFhkYVhNZmVhb2hYLTJUUWh0dXJJdXVHangtbDJMM0ZvZG16dnotWHBMNDJMTmlaQ3g1QVlfZ0NfOWVRZzk2YjduelNoWFA3LWMtbzh5VDdvc1gyMk1zMVFGcV9qN1JWT3hh?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

														&lt;p&gt;Marijuana users have “superior performance across multiple cognitive domains,” according to a new large-scale study funded by the U.S. federal government, with the effects of cannabis on cognition “presented concurrently across a range of brain systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published this month as a preprint by Nature Portfolio, analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from 37,929 participants in the United Kingdom aged between 44 and 81 years old. The team found that cannabis consumers consistently outperformed non-users on a range of cognitive tests—suggesting that marijuana use may be linked to brain network patterns typically observed in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that cannabis use may be associated with a deceleration of neural aging processes and the preservation of cognitive function in older adults,” the paper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We speculate that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may exert neuroprotective effects during aging by preserving an optimal balance between functional segregation and integration—an essential feature for maintaining specialized processing and efficient information transfer across brain networks,” wrote the researchers, who are from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, Georgia State University, University of Colorado, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6977015/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants, noted that as marijuana laws evolve and societal attitudes shift, researchers are uncovering a more complex picture of the drug’s effects, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalization, increased permissiveness, and recognition of therapeutic potential have contributed to a marked rise in marijuana consumption among the study population, the authors said. They pointed out that older adults now represent the fastest-growing group of cannabis users, increasingly using it to manage chronic physical and mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis users exhibited superior performance across multiple cognitive domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain undergoes significant physiological changes with age, and the study underscored the importance of understanding how cannabis interacts with these processes.  The researchers cautioned, however, that “the effects of marijuana in older adults may differ significantly from those observed in younger populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address gaps in previous research around marijuana’s effects on aging, the research team utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques on a vast dataset, which included brain scans and cognitive assessments from tens of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that cannabis users demonstrated brain network “characteristics typically associated with younger brains, along with enhanced cognitive abilities, highlighting a potential modulatory role for cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in neurodegenerative processes,” potentially supporting cognitive resilience. These benefits were noted from midlife into the late 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use may confer neurocognitive benefits in older adults by modulating the organization of functional brain networks,” they speculated. “The observed effects imply that cannabinoids may exert neuroprotective influences in aging populations, potentially through their regulatory roles in maintaining or enhancing functional brain segregation and integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s large scale has the potential to make it a landmark contribution to the field of marijuana and aging research, though the team emphasized that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, a study published last year found that marijuana use is associated with lower odds of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with people who consume cannabis for recreational or medical purposes &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-consumers-have-significantly-decreased-odds-of-cognitive-decline-study-finds/"&gt;reporting less confusion and memory loss compared to non-users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study in 2023 examining marijuana’s neurocognitive effects found that “&lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/study-finds-no-evidence-that-medical-marijuana-causes-cognitive-impairment-in-patients-with-chronic-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prescribed medical cannabis may have minimal acute impact on cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; among patients with chronic health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the long-term effects of cannabis use are far from settled science, findings from a number of recent studies suggest some fears have been overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report published in April that drew on dispensary data, for instance, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-helps-cancer-patients-think-more-clearly-and-manage-pain-study-using-cannabis-from-dispensaries-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;cancer patients reported being able to think more clearly when using medical marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. They also said it helped manage pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study of teens and young adults at risk of developing psychotic disorders found that regular &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/young-people-at-risk-of-psychosis-saw-symptoms-surprisingly-improve-with-marijuana-use-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana use over a two-year period did not trigger early onset of psychosis symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—contrary to the claims of prohibitionists who argue that cannabis causes mental illness. In fact, it was associated with modest improvements in cognitive functioning and reduced use of other medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another study published by the American Medical Association (AMA) last year that looked at data from more than 63 million health insurance beneficiaries determined that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-legalization-not-associated-with-increased-rates-of-psychosis-american-medical-association-study-of-63-million-people-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;there’s “no statistically significant increase” in psychosis-related diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; in states that have legalized marijuana compared to those that continue to criminalize cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from 2018, meanwhile, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/smoking-marijuana-actually-improves-working-memory-study-indicates/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana may actually increase working memory&lt;/a&gt; and that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-use-doesnt-actually-change-the-structure-of-your-brain-new-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;doesn’t actually change the structure of the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s more complicated and more exciting. It’s a constant process of exploration. An adventure into the unknown. Scientists come up with theories about what might be going on, and then test them. They don’t always get it right. Far from it. But inch by inch, testing, failing and trying again, they make progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate confirmation &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearingto-consider-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hearings&lt;/a&gt; for the role of secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"commentisfree","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"Blog","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/coronavirus-outbreak","type":"Keyword","title":"Coronavirus"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"business/pharmaceuticals-industry","type":"Keyword","title":"Pharmaceuticals industry"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/editorials","type":"Tone","title":"Editorials"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"profile/editorial","type":"Contributor","title":"Editorial"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/opinion","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Letters and Leader Writers"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"commentisfree/2025/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-rfk-jrs-vaccine-cuts-an-assault-on-science-from-a-politician-unfit-for-his-office","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cutting&lt;/a&gt; $500m of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact, no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which many &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Could-Bird-Flu-Be-the-Next-Global-Pandemic.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; could trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Either Mr Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable. The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, and &lt;a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-measles-vaccines-are-important-but-government-mandates-are-not-the-answer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mandating&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with many people known to have sceptical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mr Kennedy is particularly hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, &lt;a href="https://publichealthcollaborative.org/alerts/false-claims-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-the-most-deadly-vaccines-in-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panning&lt;/a&gt; them in 2021 as the “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2022-01-24/ty-article/.premium/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-vaccine-mandates-harder-to-escape-than-nazi-persecution/0000017f-dc44-d3a5-af7f-feee56c50000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; mandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to vaccinate billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19. They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor countries.

His mother, Ruthi Clement, told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; she found her son face-down in his bed, his skin purple. Two doses of Narcan didn’t work to revive her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/health/demi-lovato-overdose-narcan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Narcan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Narcan&lt;/a&gt; — the branded name for naloxone — is an emergency medication intended to reverse the effects of a narcotic overdose. But nitazenes are so potent that Narcan isn’t as effective as it is against a heroin overdose, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the influx of fentanyl, and now nitazenes, is that it’s easier to smuggle in smaller, but more potent drugs, U.K. National Crime Agency Deputy Director Charles Yates told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “They buy potent nitazenes cheaply and mix them with bulking agents such as caffeine and paracetamol to strengthen the product being sold and make significant profits,” Yates told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowder Funeral Home&lt;/p&gt; Lucci's mom is speaking out after her son died from a pill laced with nitazene.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's commonly mixed into pills and powders, a man in Sydney was arrested on Aug. 5 for selling vapes that were "supercharged" with the drug, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/06/sydney-vapes-nitazene-synthetic-opioid-ntwnfb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Guardian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.

&lt;p&gt;The agency’s director, Jay Bhattacharya, made the statement during an appearance on right-wing provocateur Steve Bannon’s podcast, “War Room,” that &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-4696-the-mainstreams-destruction-of-public-health/id1485351658?i=1000721307609" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;aired on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. His rationale for the cancellation of the contracts does not align with the explanation offered last week by his boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt;said vaccines made using this platform were not effective and were unsafe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH director, who came to national prominence during the pandemic as a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration — a policy statement urging the U.S. government to lift Covid containment measures — said the declining uptake of Covid boosters signals that the public isn’t willing to be immunized with mRNA-based vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as public health goes, the mRNA platform for vaccines is no longer viable,” Bhattacharya said. “You can’t have a platform where such a large fraction of the population distrusts the platform, if you’re going to use it for vaccines, and expect it to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been among the most prominent figures in the U.S. voicing distrust of the vaccines, long before he became the U.S. secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, called Bhattacharya’s comment “disingenuous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies have argued — despite scientific evidence — that the vaccines are not safe and effective, and “that message that they’re selling is one of the major reasons why there is potential public reluctance,” Osterholm told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya confirmed it was Kennedy’s decision to terminate the contracts that had been issued by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.  BARDA is the HHS division responsible for developing medical countermeasures for natural and bioterror threats. In May, BARDA also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;rescinded $766 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; to Moderna for work the vaccine manufacturer was doing to develop, test, and bring through licensure several vaccines for flu viruses that could trigger pandemics.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Bannon podcast, Bhattacharya said that, in his view, the mRNA vaccine platform is “promising but not yet ready for prime time for vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Billions of people around the world have been vaccinated with mRNA-based vaccines since the first two vaccines for Covid — Cominarty, made by the Pfizer and BioNTech partnership, and Spikevax, made by Moderna — went into use in December 2020. Other vaccines made using different production approaches eventually came to market. But a substantial portion of Covid vaccine doses administered in the intervening years were made using mRNA and widely credited with saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya reiterated a concern sometimes espoused by critics of mRNA vaccines that relates to the fact that the shots trigger the body to produce the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby training the immune system to recognize it and produce antibodies to attack the virus in the case of infection. Critics of the vaccines argue it isn’t possible to know how much antigen — the protein the immune system is being introduced to — these vaccines generate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For vaccines, what you want is a technology where you understand the dose of the antigen being given,” he said. When “you have a platform like the mRNA platform, what you’re doing essentially [is] you’re turning your body into an antigen factor. You’re taking your cells, which are capable of taking the mRNA programming, and turn out an antigen that you want to be produced there.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, said the concern Bhattacharya raised is also true in the case of another type of vaccine, those made using live but weakened viruses. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, the rotavirus vaccine, and the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that the mRNA is destroyed shortly after vaccination,” said Hensley, who is working to develop a universal flu vaccine using mRNA technology. “It is difficult to quantify the amount of antigen produced by the vaccine, but this is an issue that has already been addressed in vaccinology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Bhattacharya might not realize that a lot of human vaccines are based on live-attenuated viruses, where we similarly cannot definitively quantify antigen amounts produced in [recipients],” he said. “This is why we complete human clinical studies before vaccines are widely used in humans. The mRNA and live attenuated vaccine platforms have both proven to be safe and effective in clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya also noted that Covid vaccines made using mRNA do not prevent infection; he said he contracted Covid for the first time two months after getting vaccinated. In fact, this is true about all Covid vaccines — none permanently block infection — and about vaccines that protect against influenza as well. The vaccines, which are made using a variety of production platforms, do, however,  lower the risk of severe infection that would lead to hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We would all love a vaccine that prevents infections altogether, but keeping people alive and out of the hospital during a pandemic is pretty darn good,” Hensley said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The prospect that mRNA technology could be improved is a rationale for further investment in research, not abandonment of this production method, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should try to improve the mRNA platform by investing in mRNA vaccine research. If we continue to invest in this platform, in 5-10 years we will likely be able to develop vaccines that elicit broader responses and better mucosal responses that prevent infections,” Hensley said in an email. “Now is the time to continue to develop this platform so that we can be ready to respond to the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Now she's forced to only use the drug as a 'last resort'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Mendez (pictured), former psychotherapist in Indiana, said a steroid injection gave her symptoms of 'mania' within days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When taken at high doses or for extended periods, corticosteroids can interfere with the balance of certain brain chemicals, potentially leading to an increased likelihood of symptoms of depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability or even mania or psychosis,' Dr Jeffrey Ditzell, lead psychiatrist at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jeffditzellpsychiatry.com/"&gt;Dr Ditzell Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pain throughout the body by mimicking the effects of cortisol, a 'stress hormone' released by the adrenal glands to regulate inflammation, by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suppress the immune system, which triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are different from anabolic steroids - synthetic forms of testosterone often used as performance-enhancing drugs by athletes - and generally treat autoimmune conditions, allergic reactions and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a pharmacist, I see these medications used for anything from a sore throat to a skin rash to asthma to an unknown condition that involves the immune system,' Dr Erika Gray, pharmacist and founder and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.toolboxgenomics.com/"&gt;ToolBox Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids usually come as pills but can also be taken as injections, via ear and eye ingestion or as intravenous infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prednisone in particular is thought to disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which coordinates the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal glands, all of which regulate the body's stress response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dysregulation can send stress hormones like cortisol into overdrive, contributing to mood swings and symptoms of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Long term corticosteroid use can also cause the memory section of our brain to decrease in size which can negatively affect our memory and mood,' Dr Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A great way to think about the effect of corticosteroids on the brain is this medication makes your brain feel it is under constant stress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone with about 18 million prescriptions per year (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mendez, a former psychotherapist and mental health author, was given an injection of the corticosteroid Kenalog, a brand name for triamcinolone, in 2023 for shoulder pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within a day of getting this steroid injection, I started to experience hypomanic symptoms.

Despite this, I developed severe mania and was hospitalized shortly after. The onset of hypomania/mania coincided with the steroid injection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital told Mendez the steroid injection likely triggered the hypomania, a less severe form of mania that causes extreme mood and energy changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of this, and the fact that I live with bipolar, steroids will be a last resort for me in the future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TikTok user, Amanda Powell, said prednisone made her feel like she was 'losing' her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw therapist after psychiatrist over and over and over again and nothing was going right. They prescribed me depression and anxiety medication and it just made my mania worse,' she said in a recent video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The crazy thing is people never associate prednisone with mania.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video posted earlier this year, Powell said, 'The side effects aren't worth the journey sometimes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell said prednisone in particular is most commonly associated with depression, irritability and mania at high doses, while its counterpart dexamethasone may increase the risk of sleep disruptions along with mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said oral corticosteroids are most likely to cause depression and other mood issues. These include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained inhaled versions of the drugs have a 'lower risk of mood effects due to low systemic absorption' while topical creams have a 'very low risk of systemic mood side effects unless used over large areas for long periods'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also said 'using topical hydrocortisone for long periods of time and over a large part of the body' could increase the risk of systemic absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell believes the risk of depression is highest with bigger doses - over 40 milligrams per day - over longer periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilary Hodge (pictured) told the Daily Mail while she is normally 'mellow', steroids make her moods drastically shift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women and older patients may also be at a greater risk due to having more hormone fluctuations and general sensitivity to medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk of depression and mood changes can be managed and, in some cases, lowered or prevented with using the lowest effective dose of the medication for the shortest duration of time,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The use of local instead of systemic steroids when possible is recommended. For example, for asthma, allergies or eczema, inhaled, nasal or topical steroids are often safer than oral medications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggests tapering the dose slowly, which means gradually decreasing it over time before stopping. This helps minimize any effects from sudden dosage changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also advised against quitting cold turkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never stop corticosteroids medication suddenly or without your prescribers help. These medications need to be slowly decreased over time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts urged those taking corticosteroids to keep a close eye on potential side effects and seek medical attention immediately if they notice drastic changes in mood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While taking corticosteroids, it is important to take immediate action if you experience suicidal thoughts or urges, if you feel out of control, or experience intense agitation or paranoia. Call a crisis line, reach out to a mental health professional, or go to the ER,' Dr Ditzell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These symptoms are rare, but serious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:11:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPd3lORm16d0NfMFEyMC1nUEVoUkwtZlZxYkI2bEpiOGczcjBmM1VlSElMaHRUUC1KRXZYeGg5Q29UdDlqalNPS3JQR0wyYUhZeWhGLUtpc0dtMHg1emF1Uk1DZlplZTd2eHVKOG80YUxwY091UF8xOE1PeUh4VFM4Y0ZvUTRfM2ZMZi12T0U3ekwzTk45cFVQWXZBdkMweW1yZVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家对薯条和糖尿病的发现- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5BOEgtUjFrVkxmMmVfbHN3Z1pEeUdUdzlWSllBaVVGSDQyay1TaVhmaFN2N25wSlJpMTRqN054RG9oWmlUb1U3QlZvb2FFUGhDaWpWYkZoZ0xPWXk3eGhpQUdwUkFqNHUyanlSWDd2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Eating three servings of French fries a week is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but eating similar amounts of potatoes cooked in other ways -- boiled, baked or mashed -- does not substantially increase the risk, finds a study published by &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; on August 6.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, replacing any form of potatoes with whole grains was associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk, but swapping them for white rice was linked to an increased risk, the results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potatoes contain several nutrients including fiber, vitamin C, and magnesium, but they also have a high starch content and therefore a high glycemic index, so have been linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither the preparation method for potatoes nor specific foods that potatoes would replace have been considered, both of which are key to evaluating the overall health impact of potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, researchers investigated the association between intake of potatoes prepared by different methods (boiled, baked, or mashed versus French fries) and risk of type 2 diabetes. They also looked at the impact on health of replacing potatoes with other major carbohydrates, such as whole grains and rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings are based on more than 205,000 health professionals from three large US studies carried out between 1984 and 2021. Participants were free of diabetes, heart disease or cancer and completed detailed food questionnaires every four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During almost 40 years of follow up, 22,299 people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors related to diabetes risk, the researchers found that for every three weekly servings of total potato, the rate of type 2 diabetes increased by 5% and for every three weekly servings of French fries, the rate increased by 20%. However, similar intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with a significantly increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing three weekly servings of total potato with whole grains lowered the type 2 diabetes rate by 8%. Substituting baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with whole grains lowered the rate by 4%, and replacing French fries lowered the rate by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, replacing total potatoes or baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with white rice was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. Most participants were also health professionals of European ancestry, so findings may not apply to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our findings underscore that the association between potato intake and type 2 diabetes risk depends on the specific foods used as replacement. The findings also align with current dietary recommendations that promote the inclusion of whole grains as part of a healthy diet for the prevention of type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are potatoes back on the plate? Well, it depends, say researchers in a linked editorial, who note that it is important to consider preparation method and replacement food when guiding the public or informing policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point out that with their relatively low environmental impact and their health impact, baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes can be part of a healthy and sustainable diet, though whole grains should remain a priority, but say future studies from more diverse populations that account for both preparation methods and substitution analysis are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both olive oil and avocado oil are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado oil is great for high-heat cooking and blends well into dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil has the most research supporting its heart-health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been a go-to for heart-healthy cooking, but avocado oil is quickly rising in popularity for its versatility and nutritional benefits. So which one is better for your heart—or does it make a difference? We asked cardiologists to weigh in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-avocado-oil-for-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Benefits of Avocado Oil for Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once known as a niche ingredient favored by avid cooks, avocado oil has steadily gained mainstream popularity. Its neutral flavor and high smoke point make it a standout for cooking, but its potential heart-health benefits really set it apart. Here’s a look at what it can offer for your cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil contains a mixture of beneficial fats, with a high proportion being monounsaturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consuming these fats is linked with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cholesterol management&lt;/a&gt;. “Oils high in monounsaturated fats help reduce LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and raise HDL (‘good’) cholesterol,” explains&lt;a href="https://chicagoheartvascular.com/about/rohit-vuppuluri-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Rohit Vuppuluri, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at Chicago Heart and Vascular Specialists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both human and animal studies suggest that avocado oil may help lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, a small 2017 study found that replacing butter with avocado oil reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels in 13 overweight individuals. However, larger human studies are still needed to confirm these effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Heart-Healthy Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil is rich in plant compounds that act as antioxidants—like tocopherols, phytosterols and carotenoids—which can support heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These compounds work by neutralizing free radicals, the unstable compounds that cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Vuppuluri explains that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so taming it via diet is a heart-healthy choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit of using avocado oil is its high smoke point, which helps minimize the formation of free radicals during cooking. “Avocado oil is known to be the most resistant to high-heat cooking,” says&lt;a href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologists/dr-khashayar-hematpour-md-1902065543" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Khashayar Hematpour, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann and UTHealth Houston. “As anyone who’s been in the kitchen knows, some oils, like butter, burn quickly and darken, which means they’ve produced harmful compounds.” Avocado oil, on the other hand, can be heated to around 480°F (280°C) before it begins to break down, making it an excellent option for high-heat cooking.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil’s inflammation-fighting properties may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. “[Avocado oil’s] anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidant compounds help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow,” says Vuppuluri. For now, most of the evidence comes from animal studies, so more human studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, a 2022 study found that women who ate more avocados—not avocado oil specifically—had a significantly lower risk of developing hypertension. In fact, those who ate five servings per week (half an avocado per serving) reduced their risk of high blood pressure by 17%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although more research is needed, these benefits might also apply to avocado oil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-olive-oil-for-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Benefits of Olive Oil for Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been celebrated for its versatility and heart-supporting nutrients. Here’s what we know about this classic cooking oil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like avocado oil, olive oil is packed with antioxidants—though the specific types vary. Olive oil contains a variety of polyphenolic compounds, including phenol alcohols and acids, secoiridoids, lignans and flavones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to Hematpour, these heart-healthy compounds neutralize free radicals, helping to keep inflammation in check. In fact, numerous studies have linked greater olive oil consumption with lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Supports Healthy Cholesterol and Blood Lipids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research on avocado oil is still in its early stages, olive oil has a much lengthier track record of improving cholesterol levels in people. This comes down to their healthy monounsaturated fats, says Hematpour. Studies have found modest increases in HDL cholesterol and reductions in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with olive oil consumption—particularly when it’s used instead of butter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Support Healthy Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding to its list of heart-healthy benefits, olive oil may also support healthy blood pressure. According to a 2020 review, both experimental and human studies suggest that this flavorful fat has antihypertensive effects—thanks to its high oleic acid content and antioxidant-rich polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “On top of that, if you consume a diet that has a higher proportion of unsaturated fats, that means you’re consuming less saturated fat, which is the harmful kind that can increase blood pressure,” says Hematpour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-final-verdict"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While both avocado and olive oil are great choices for heart health, the cardiologists we spoke with recommend olive oil for its longer track record in research. “Olive oil has been extensively studied and has strong evidence that it is heart-healthy,” Vuppuluri says. He adds that these benefits are especially clear in the context of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, where olive oil is a staple and likely plays a role in its cardiovascular benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, remember that quality counts. The olives used and their method of processing can alter the nutrition of olive oil, Vuppuluri says. “Cold-pressed, unrefined olive oil is best to preserve the full nutritional and heart-healthy benefit.” It’s especially great when used on salads or with moderate-heat cooking like sautéing or baking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your choice may also depend on how you plan to use the oil and your taste preferences. Olive oil’s bold, robust flavor livens up dishes like roasted veggies and meat marinades. Avocado oil has a lighter taste, meaning it blends well into dips, dressings and baked goods—and it’s better for high-heat cooking methods like frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although olive oil has more research behind it, both olive and avocado oils can be heart-smart additions to your daily meals.

My husband’s mother, father, and the majority of his extended family are compulsive gamblers. They are constantly in debt, and many have been bankrupt multiple times. Thankfully, my husband does not gamble or have addictive behavior. His problem isn’t addiction, it’s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband cosigned several high-interest loans for him, but when his dad stopped paying them back , my husband refused to cosign another loan. But besides his dad, he is very loyal to his family and helps them out when they ask for money.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband supports this plan. I can’t, though. Moving here will get her away from Vegas, but it will not solve the underlying financial issues and gambling addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that his mother moving here will result in a lot of additional costs that neither of she nor my husband are anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to help my mother-in-law when she needs it, but I don’t know how to get my husband to draw boundaries. I have recommended gambling addiction services, but he dismisses it as a cultural/family problem and doesn’t think it will help. Do you have any recommendations for how to help someone in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

You might want to reach out to &lt;a href="https://al-anon.org/"&gt;Al-Anon&lt;/a&gt;, which helps families and friends of alcoholics deal with the issues that addiction raises in their lives. While the issue here is gambling, not drinking, Al-Anon might still be able to help.&lt;/p&gt;

(They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f0764" class="body-graf"&gt;Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f3c72" class="body-graf"&gt;After surgery, blood tests showed that a smattering of cancer cells remained behind, referred to as microscopic residual disease, which is very common with pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00c80b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about cancer that is so microscopic that we can’t see it on scans,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8707f" class="body-graf"&gt;These cells can travel elsewhere in the body and grow into &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/liquid-biopsies-alert-advanced-breast-cancer-patients-new-drugs-are-ne-rcna209735" target="_blank"&gt;metastasized tumors&lt;/a&gt;, prompting an often fatal cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy can kill some of these cells, but some usually remain in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d83449" class="body-graf"&gt;“Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5088b5" class="body-graf"&gt;Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. Thirteen also received booster shots. The whole process took 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b185b" class="body-graf"&gt;About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7dd43a" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. A few people were “super-responders” who mounted an abnormally strong immune response to the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75e4cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those people had the best outcomes,” Wainberg said. His team is currently running a randomized &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2024.42.3_suppl.TPS720" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 2 trial &lt;/a&gt;to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cef6fa" class="body-graf"&gt;In the Phase 1 trial, people with pancreatic cancer survived for an average of 29 months and lived recurrence-free for more than 15 months post-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79e4c6" class="body-graf"&gt;“That far exceeds the rates with resectable cancers,” said Wainberg, referring to cancers that can be removed with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6ef5c2" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-889a17" class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. Only recently has medical technology made the strides researchers needed to hone the treatment. Refined mRNA technology and gene sequencing becoming faster and cheaper has put cancer vaccines back into clinical trials, Dougan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adb508" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-reduces-relapse-therapy-trial-shows-rcna79543" target="_blank"&gt;Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are showing promise in both &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine-mrna-treatment-trial-rcna192702" target="_blank"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccines-frontier-cancer-treatment-rcna8886" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, but a one-size-fits-all cancer vaccine would make treatment faster and cheaper. Past trials using peptide vaccines have failed to prevent cancer recurrences. But the peptides in the new vaccine, called lipophilic peptides, have something past treatments did not — a tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67dc61" class="body-graf"&gt;“That tail sticks in the lymph nodes where immune cells get activated,” Dougan said. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f58f3" class="body-graf"&gt;More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences. Memorial Sloan Kettering is also working on an &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01266083" target="_blank"&gt;off-the-shelf vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that targets a gene mutation found in 95% of people with acute myeloid leukemia. The data from the KRAS-targeting vaccine trial published Monday showed it is likely possible to target these mutations with nonpersonalized vaccines, something researchers long thought was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91f421" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The fact that the long-term survival really correlated with T-cell response suggests that the vaccine caused this,” Dougan said, referring to the specific immune cells activated by the vaccine. “The idea that you can target KRAS is really exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNLS1peXpqalFiUDN6OUczcjNLckpTWVlrZkJJa0tlRXdBV1NMSHZvVjB1RlJMNlBVVzlQUDVhS05QNjFCcjd1Nzk0Nk9QbGNsNWJDZGUwQ3V4QUdFM3I2NWh6YmlRS0ZYYjJDdTctMHdIXzh4MnJTT1ZvcEh4ZVpEQzV5SDBaMm1Id3lTTkQ5LWFaRWhDUTQyOVpTZERBVU1YaUNBcG1QVzIyWTNiaEN6UnA5dE9famVr0gFWQVVfeXFMT2F0TXZmbTV1VDRMT3JkbU1haVByZk93NWNTYzh5d2UwWDNpSllBZG9JQ2ExbWptbUE0MDBuS3l3T2xtT0g3T0xqLWpqcy1jdHhuQkkwMlE</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，现成的疫苗有望预防癌症复发-《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNR1FaUEFDa3g2Um5DVUdJSGFGY3otaWpaZUw2UXFDVFFiVWcyOTlGWU1LcHpHb2VsUmdCYkRsY3NjNk9BcV9MaEY2VEJCN1FYbHlYaGxmMlcxMDdBaGFHTk9MbkhsMkh5SDViSkFFNkFCTXlDT1p3N05VQk5tTEZKdndoN2lWd3JqUVJiamlCYWkzRU4tZjdOZ2V0OW4wcUVVLWlEWnpzMndaYzRjZ1Z0bQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An off-the-shelf vaccine has shown promise in preventing the return of pancreatic and colorectal cancer, researchers have revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cancer vaccines have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/31/what-are-cancer-vaccines-and-have-scientists-finally-found-a-cure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.

These mutations result in the production of altered Kras proteins that cause cells to divide and proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Wainberg and colleagues reported how they gave a vaccine called ELI-002 2P to 20 patients who had had surgery for pancreatic cancer and five who had been operated on for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine contains peptides – long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The vaccine works by training the T-cells of the body’s immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells with mutations that result in them producing the altered Kras proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At a median follow-up of almost 20 months, the team found patients fell into two groups: 17 who had a strong immune response to the jab and eight who had a weaker response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the former group experienced a longer period before their cancer returned and survived longer overall. Overall, four of those 17 patients died during follow-up, compared with seven of the eight who had a lower immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the study is early stage research designed primarily to assess safety, involved only 25 participants, had no controls, and looked at two very different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even so, experts said the results were worth noting. Siow Ming Lee, a professor of medical oncology at University College London, who was not involved with the work, suggested the ELI-002 2P vaccine could be combine with other kinds of immunotherapy, and might help a wider range of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With promising early results and potentially fewer side-effects than current oral inhibitors, this off-the-shelf cancer vaccine could expand treatment options for Kras-driven cancers and warrants further testing in larger trials, including exploring its potential use in lung cancers driven by mutations in Kras gene,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Shivan Sivakumar of the University of Birmingham, who works on mRNA-based pancreatic cancer vaccines, said it was fascinating so many of the patients in the study showed a clear immune response to the off-the-shelf vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Sivakumar noted that a key advantage of personalised mRNA vaccines was that they did not have to rely on mutations in the Kras gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said it was now important to carry out randomised control trials of the ELI-002 2P vaccine and follow patients over a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How many times have we been down this garden path where we’ve got really excited about the science? But actually, ultimately, the real scientific experiment is in patients,” Sivakumar added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNR1FaUEFDa3g2Um5DVUdJSGFGY3otaWpaZUw2UXFDVFFiVWcyOTlGWU1LcHpHb2VsUmdCYkRsY3NjNk9BcV9MaEY2VEJCN1FYbHlYaGxmMlcxMDdBaGFHTk9MbkhsMkh5SDViSkFFNkFCTXlDT1p3N05VQk5tTEZKdndoN2lWd3JqUVJiamlCYWkzRU4tZjdOZ2V0OW4wcUVVLWlEWnpzMndaYzRjZ1Z0bQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家终于从列奥纳多·达·芬奇的绘画中解开了500年前的谜团--印度国防评论</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxONzc5WWNQWDUtZE1xTE9HNkNQazVUMGYxOVVQQzFvNWhaeklRMUQ1Njd6LTN1SUVhS0VNQ2NnclZyVDRBZ3NZdk83TlRsMUZ4Q1hKTFptT1huTUZqT0tzUUJHbzFuS1o1N3pIWWZXSEVZeWdibGptZ3pyQUIxcEs1TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers have cracked a 500-year-old anatomical puzzle that was first identified by the brilliant Leonardo da Vinci. The mystery surrounds the trabeculae of the heart, an intricate muscular network that has baffled scientists for centuries. Da Vinci sketched these fine, branching structures in the 15th century after meticulously dissecting the human heart. However, it wasn’t until recent advancements in computational biology and genetics that the function and importance of the trabeculae were truly understood. This discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2635-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combined fractal analysis, MRI technology, and genetic research to unveil crucial insights into heart health that could have a profound impact on cardiovascular research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Da Vinci’s Pioneering Work on Human Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/leonardo-da-vincis-sketch-hidden-tunnels/" data-type="post" data-id="73044"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;, the polymath renowned for his art and scientific inquiries, made significant contributions to the study of human anatomy. His work, particularly his dissections of the human body, was revolutionary for his time. In the late 15th century, while most of Europe still adhered to ancient ideas about human anatomy, da Vinci’s detailed sketches of the human heart, muscles, and organs went far beyond what was known at the time. His heart drawings, in particular, included the first depictions of trabeculae, complex, tree-like structures within the heart’s chambers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though da Vinci had observed these structures, he was not entirely sure of their function. He theorized that they played a role in ensuring the circulation of blood, a precursor to what we know today about cardiovascular function. However, the exact role of the trabeculae remained a mystery for centuries. His work laid the foundation for future generations of scientists to unravel the secrets of heart anatomy, though it wasn’t until the 21st century that technology caught up with his insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Discovery of Trabeculae’s Role in Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article titled &lt;em&gt;“The role of myocardial trabeculae in cardiac function and disease”&lt;/em&gt;, researchers utilized a novel combination of genetics, MRI imaging, and fractal analysis to finally unlock the true function of trabeculae. This study, which analyzed heart images from more than 18,000 participants in the UK Biobank, revealed that the trabeculae are not simply remnants of embryonic development, as once believed. Instead, they play a vital role in regulating the heart’s performance by affecting the efficiency of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One of the most groundbreaking aspects of this study was the identification of a link between trabecular structure and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Researchers found that certain structural characteristics of trabeculae correlate with a higher likelihood of heart conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias. This finding opened a new door in the study of genetic predisposition to heart disease. Researchers could now pinpoint specific genetic loci that contribute to the formation and regulation of trabeculae, giving them a better understanding of how heart diseases develop at a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fractal Theory and Its Role in Understanding the Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fractal theory, which deals with complex, self-similar patterns found in nature, played a crucial role in this discovery. Just as a tree branches out into smaller and smaller limbs, trabeculae have a similar branching structure within the heart. By applying fractal analysis, scientists could study these branching patterns in detail, allowing them to make more accurate predictions about how the heart functions. This mathematical model not only helped in understanding the trabeculae’s role but also provided insights into how these structures might influence heart performance and disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application of fractal theory was particularly important because it allowed researchers to analyze the complex geometrical patterns of trabeculae in a way that wasn’t possible with traditional methods. By examining the branching structure in such detail, the team was able to identify subtle differences between healthy and diseased hearts. This breakthrough opened up new avenues for using computational models to simulate heart disease and predict how different factors, such as genetics or lifestyle, may affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Cardiology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant revelations from this study was the intersection of genetics and the trabeculae’s role in heart disease. By using data from the UK Biobank, scientists were able to correlate specific genes with the development and function of trabeculae. This breakthrough is especially important because it ties the structural changes in the heart to underlying genetic factors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Through this genetic analysis, researchers identified several loci linked to the regulation of trabeculae. These loci are responsible for the formation of the trabecular network, and variations in these genes may contribute to abnormalities in heart function. This discovery could lead to the development of new genetic tests for early detection of heart disease, enabling doctors to identify individuals at risk before symptoms even appear. Furthermore, understanding the genetic basis of trabeculae could lead to targeted therapies aimed at modifying these structures to prevent or treat heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

He came back a second year, and it grew.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One person described the rabbit as having “a scabbiesh-looking growth over their face.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to wildlife officials, the growths are caused by a virus that results in wart-like protrusions on the rabbit’s face or head. The condition is similar to benign cancerous cells and has no known cure, CPW said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wildlife officials emphasized that while the virus can spread between rabbits, it is not known to be contagious to humans, dogs, or other wildlife. They said it doesn’t hurt the rabbit, unless it grows on sensitive areas like their eyes or mouths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the virus is not considered a threat to public health, wildlife officials recommend giving infected rabbits space and avoiding any attempts to help or handle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNTDN5TzR6NFZ4Z0N0cGwzVk5jcm5DeUtETGFJODYxakt4UUlDTTlMSWVXdUtHMkpsZ1U4eVZ6ZGtxSkYzR19ra1ZnM2Jtc2lnb0pUOXFTa3J1RUNncXgwTTEwTXM3UXFWR2pLNXdjaUVjVUVJRWlzSmFESlRXOG1OYnBlWnAxU1YyNnI0aGFLQU9GT21zeHlhS1BzWUlNb1dpeHlSNEZZVE8yZFkxQjFpclAwa2xqZw</guid></item><item><title>早期虐待会影响成人性行为-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQaWJrYXdQM2dmdTY5cHhodHk1SUd2VE9jT3I3MExVZUFZbFI5eC1pUlhsYXZUOGVBODdYOFBDcEJmR2tCWVpDNzlvOHNXdlR2WmxYc2xzZW0xZlktYldpTXBjMUFvaUFpNnVFTkY1WkRNUXJHVmVBT2ZoNVBUSnd5aA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has found that sexual narcissism mediates the link between childhood trauma and compulsive sexual behavior. Researchers compared individuals with and without compulsive sexual behavior, measuring trauma history, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with compulsive sexual behavior scored higher in all three areas, and statistical analysis showed that trauma predicted narcissistic sexual attitudes, which in turn predicted hypersexuality. The findings suggest that addressing sexual narcissism could be a key component in treating compulsive sexual behavior, particularly in individuals with histories of abuse or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediating Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual narcissism significantly mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and hypersexual behavior, explaining over 60% of the variance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk Group:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with compulsive sexual behavior scored higher in trauma history, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality than controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Trends:&lt;/strong&gt; Men, religious participants, bisexual individuals, and non-academics reported higher hypersexuality scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies a clear psychological pathway from childhood trauma to compulsive sexual behavior, offering a new focus for prevention and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How This Aligns with Previous Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports earlier findings linking abuse history to hypersexuality and builds on work showing narcissistic traits can influence sexual aggression and risk-taking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Could inform the development of targeted therapy modules addressing sexual narcissism within trauma-informed treatment programs for compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has uncovered a striking psychological pathway linking early-life adversity to compulsive sexual behavior: childhood trauma appears to foster sexual narcissism, which in turn fuels hypersexuality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining both individuals seeking treatment for compulsive sexual behavior and a control group without these difficulties, the researchers found that this combination of past harm and personality traits could explain more than 60% of the variance in compulsive sexual behavior scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypersexuality, sometimes referred to as Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD), describes persistent and excessive sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that are difficult to control and continue despite negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual narcissism—a more focused form of narcissism—centers on sexual relationships, characterized by an inflated sense of one’s sexual desirability, entitlement in sexual contexts, low empathy, and an exploitative approach toward partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they form a potent mix that can perpetuate risky or harmful sexual patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Study Design and Participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 118 adults aged 18–59, split evenly between a group meeting CSBD criteria and a matched control group. Those in the CSBD group were recruited from support programs such as Sexaholics Anonymous, while controls came from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to capture histories of abuse and neglect, the Sexual Narcissism Scale to assess attitudes and behaviors in sexual contexts, and the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory to measure compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Findings: Trauma, Narcissism, and Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the board, individuals with CSBD scored higher than controls on childhood trauma, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality. Statistical modeling revealed that sexual narcissism acted as a mediator between trauma and hypersexuality—suggesting that early abuse or neglect increases the likelihood of developing exploitative, entitlement-based sexual attitudes, which then contribute to compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mediation effect was strong: the two factors together explained over 60% of hypersexuality variance. The findings suggest that targeting sexual narcissism in therapy could be particularly effective for individuals with a history of childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Demographic and Social Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several patterns emerged:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Men scored higher on hypersexual behavior than women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among those with CSBD, religious participants scored higher on both sexual narcissism and hypersexuality than their non-religious counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bisexual participants reported higher hypersexuality than heterosexual or homosexual participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-academic participants scored higher than those with higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While notable, these trends require replication in larger, more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why These Results Matter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for treatment approaches that address both the legacy of childhood trauma and the maladaptive sexual attitudes that may stem from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, hypersexual behavior may operate as a maladaptive coping mechanism, and sexual narcissism may reflect learned patterns of control, self-protection, or validation-seeking. Empathy training, entitlement restructuring, and trauma-informed care could improve recovery outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge the study’s limits, including its cross-sectional design, self-reported measures, and culturally homogenous sample. Future research should explore these relationships over time, assess whether reducing sexual narcissism reduces hypersexuality, and examine these dynamics in more culturally varied populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By illuminating how trauma, personality, and sexual behavior intersect, this work provides both clinicians and researchers with a clearer map of CSBD’s underlying drivers—and new opportunities for more targeted, effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this behavioral neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-025-03137-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Study on Childhood Trauma and Sexual Narcissism in Individuals with Compulsive Sexual Behavior Receiving Counseling&lt;/a&gt;” by Rotem Yaakov et al. &lt;em&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Study on Childhood Trauma and Sexual Narcissism in Individuals with Compulsive Sexual Behavior Receiving Counseling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) has been associated with trauma and neglect in childhood. There is evidence that CSB is related to child physical and sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual narcissism was linked with aggression, sex at a young age, and many partners for sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined the associations between childhood abuse and neglect, sexual narcissism, and hypersexual behavior among participants of a sex addiction support group and a group of control participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 118 adults, including 72 men and 46 women, with a mean age of 32 years (SD = 9.32) and an age range of 18–59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included 59 participants in the sex addiction group (sexaholics anonymous, SA), 36 men and 23 women with a mean age 31.41 years (SD = 8.13), and the control group from the general population included 36 men and 23 women with a mean age 32.47 years (SD = 10.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory, the Sexual Narcissism Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Childhood trauma was associated with sexual narcissism and with hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mediation model showed that sexual narcissism and child trauma significantly contributed to ratings of hypersexual behavior, and explained 60.3% of the variance of hypersexual behavior ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, using the Bootstrapping method, the indirect effects found in this model showed that sexual narcissism increased the likelihood of hypersexual behavior, and it was a significant mediating factor between trauma and hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, this study indicates that sexual narcissism mediated the relationships between childhood trauma and hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings explain the role of sexual narcissism and CSA in hypersexual behavior and it may have clinical implications for the treatment of CSB disorder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQaWJrYXdQM2dmdTY5cHhodHk1SUd2VE9jT3I3MExVZUFZbFI5eC1pUlhsYXZUOGVBODdYOFBDcEJmR2tCWVpDNzlvOHNXdlR2WmxYc2xzZW0xZlktYldpTXBjMUFvaUFpNnVFTkY1WkRNUXJHVmVBT2ZoNVBUSnd5aA</guid></item><item><title>女性希望更早知道的23个健康课程- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS1JFTGZ4MmZZbHVOdDc3TzBxR2tFR2ZIeUJ2dXJmOW5jNnliNHY3b3hSVjBvYW1ha0k3cU9PRm1QMGhJU1ZFUENFRXAtczlKV3lFNGhGc0pmSWVhZFRRbkgtSUxVUVRBTUlfVXY0YjVCanZDc09sVWlXcE5sM19XWVRLVWgwUUVxUExrMzZuY1Y1Yl8xTld4MXR4WXhUY2Jy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

He rinsed the cut with hydrogen peroxide and pressed on a Band-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, the 77-year-old was in the emergency room, vomiting with a fever. His symptoms escalated — his blood pressure dropped and lab results showed high levels of lactic acid, a warning sign of impending septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors later found the culprit was &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/gulf_coast/vibrio-vulnificus-gulf-coast-states/article_c92ad177-41f2-415a-84f3-49274965a451.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;: a rare and potentially deadly bacteria found in brackish, warm coastal waters. The infection often occurs when open wounds come in contact with contaminated water or shellfish. So far this year, 32 people across the Gulf Coast have contracted it, and eight have died, according to the states' health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy's case was different — he didn't enter water after cutting his leg, his daughter Kay Kennedy Regimbal said. Instead, the bacteria came from his trailer, which he had recently used to launch a boat in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving treatment from hospitals in Bay St. Louis and New Orleans, including two surgeries to remove skin tissue, Kennedy died on July 21 of organ failure caused by the infection, Regimbal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-6390810c-991f-427a-93cb-f125eeb074cc" data-instance="#gallery-items-eeeba7d0-0a41-4b92-bbf6-518ba6b4764c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-eeeba7d0-0a41-4b92-bbf6-518ba6b4764c"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Basil Kennedy died of organ failure caused by Vibrio vulnificus last month in Bay St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regimbal and her sister Rebekah Kennedy said their father's case underscores a widespread misunderstanding of how Vibrio vulnificus can be contracted. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;People with open wounds should be cautious when swimming in brackish or warm coastal waters or handling raw seafood, particularly when those with weakened immune systems. Vibrio can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Vibrio vulnificus infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis — a severe bacterial infection that kills the flesh around an open wound, which is why it is called a "flesh-eating" bacteria, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There doesn't need to be a fear of the water," Regimal said. "There needs to be an education and a knowledge of if you have a cut, if you potentially could have been exposed, if there is a risk, how to handle it and what to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that the infection may make people fear the water is personal for Regimbal and Rebekah Kennedy, whose happiest memories are of tubing and fishing with their father on his sailboat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of our favorite family memories are on the water," Regimbal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basil Kennedy's lifelong love for the water never dwindled, even in retirement, when he and his wife took a transatlantic cruise from England to Miami and boated through Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he wasn't sailing, Basil Kennedy traveled the world. In 2023, he, his wife and Rebekah Kennedy took a train across Europe and made brief stops in London, Paris and Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, Basil Kennedy loved his home: Hancock County, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Kennedy noted how "he always wanted to give back to the community," including his hometown of Waveland, where he served in the city's yacht club and co-founded the Waveland Ground Zero Museum to help commemorate the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was happy. He was resilient. He had a servant's heart," Rebekah Kennedy said, describing him as "the life of the party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regimbal and Rebekah Kennedy hope their father's death helps spread awareness and education about Vibrio vulnificus, without instilling fear of water. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My dad would be devastated," Regimbal said, "to hear that people fear his most favorite thing in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice symptoms of Vibrio after being near water or seafood, such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever or skin lesions, seek immediate medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Researchers at Kyushu University have developed a revolutionary organic molecule that acts as a “switch” for both OLEDs and medical imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 The molecule, named CzTRZCN, combines &lt;strong&gt;thermally activated delayed fluorescence&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;two-photon absorption&lt;/strong&gt; to enhance efficiency in displays and imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🖥️ CzTRZCN achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% in OLED applications, highlighting its potential for brighter and more energy-efficient screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 The molecule’s metal-free, low-toxicity nature makes it highly &lt;strong&gt;biocompatible&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for safer and sharper &lt;strong&gt;medical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers at Kyushu University have unveiled an innovative organic molecule capable of transforming both OLED displays and medical imaging technologies. This dual-function molecule acts as a “switch,” shifting its structure to emit light for displays and absorb light for deep-tissue imaging. This discovery could revolutionize consumer electronics and biomedical diagnostics, merging two previously separate technological worlds. With the potential to power brighter screens and enable safer medical imaging, this advancement represents a significant leap forward in material science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revolutionizing OLED and Medical Imaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OLED displays, celebrated for their vibrant colors and energy efficiency, utilize materials that emit light through a process called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). TADF improves efficiency by converting triplet-state energy, which is typically wasted, into light-emitting singlet states. This process enhances display brightness and reduces energy consumption. In contrast, deep-tissue medical imaging demands materials that absorb low-energy, near-infrared light to minimize cellular damage and improve imaging precision. Two-photon absorption (2PA) enables this by allowing a molecule to absorb two lower-energy photons simultaneously, focusing on tissue at the laser’s focal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining TADF and 2PA in a single molecule has been a longstanding challenge due to their conflicting structural requirements. TADF benefits from twisted molecular structures with separated electron orbitals, while 2PA requires planar structures with overlapping orbitals. This makes dual-function molecules exceedingly rare. The Kyushu University team has tackled this challenge by creating a molecule, CzTRZCN, that combines an electron-rich carbazole unit with an electron-deficient triazine core. Cyano groups further adjust the orbital arrangement, allowing the molecule to act as a “switch” between its roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vcV2TWPZMT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/microsofts-1-billion-quantum-leap-theyre-playing-god-in-denmark-igniting-fears-of-tech-tyranny-and-global-power-struggles/"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 Billion Quantum Leap: “They’re Playing God” in Denmark, Igniting Fears of Tech Tyranny and Global Power Struggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakthrough in Dual-Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative molecule, CzTRZCN, demonstrates its dual functionality through theoretical calculations and practical experiments. In OLED applications, it achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% for triazine-based TADF materials. Its high 2PA cross-section and brightness make it an excellent candidate for medical imaging. The non-metallic, low-toxicity nature of CzTRZCN enhances its biocompatibility, making it suitable for use in medical probes and imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This metal-free, low-toxicity molecule is ideal for medical probes,” said lead researcher Youhei Chitose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team emphasizes the potential impact of time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, which could greatly benefit from this material’s capabilities. By successfully integrating strong TADF and high 2PA, the molecule promises to bridge the gap between photoelectronics and bioimaging, offering new possibilities for combined consumer electronics and healthcare applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Future Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study from Kyushu University outlines a strategy for designing molecules with distinct orbital arrangements for light absorption and emission. This approach could inspire the creation of multifunctional materials, extending beyond current medical and display uses. The research team aims to expand the molecule’s design to cover a broader range of emission wavelengths and is seeking collaborations with biomedical and device engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential applications include in vivo imaging, wearable sensors, and next-generation OLED displays. By combining photoelectronics and bioimaging, the research opens doors for devices that seamlessly integrate consumer electronics with healthcare technologies. The study, published in the journal Advanced Materials, highlights the potential for CzTRZCN to create brighter screens and more precise, less invasive medical imaging tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Challenges and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, scaling the production and application of CzTRZCN poses significant challenges. Developing a cost-effective method for mass production while maintaining the molecule’s unique properties will be crucial. Additionally, further research is needed to optimize the molecule for various applications, including extending its emission range and improving its stability in different environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between material scientists, biomedical engineers, and industry partners will be essential to fully realize the potential of this breakthrough. As the boundaries between consumer electronics and healthcare continue to blur, what new innovations will emerge from this intersection?&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that cannabis products higher in cannabidiol (CBD) tended to produce more consistent improvements in negative mood and sleep quality, while the benefits of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant products varied depending on participants’ inflammatory status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects nearly one in three adults in the United States and often overlaps with other issues, such as poor sleep. Many individuals with anxiety experience insomnia or disrupted rest, which can in turn worsen mental health. Treatments for these conditions are often addressed separately, even though they frequently occur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence indicates that inflammation—a process in which the immune system releases chemical messengers called cytokines—may be a shared biological factor contributing to both anxiety and sleep problems. Higher cytokine levels have been linked to worse mood and poorer sleep quality in prior studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoids like THC and CBD, found in the cannabis plant, are known to have anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory settings. Surveys also suggest that many medical cannabis users turn to the drug to help with anxiety and sleep issues. However, scientific findings on cannabis for these purposes remain mixed, and little is known about whether a person’s level of inflammation might influence the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to investigate whether four weeks of cannabis use would affect inflammatory markers in the blood, and whether baseline inflammation might change how cannabis influences mood and sleep quality. They also wanted to compare products with different cannabinoid profiles: THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, and those containing equal parts THC and CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing anxiety and improving sleep are two of the most commonly reported reasons why people report using cannabis. And while it makes sense that anxiety and sleep might be linked (who hasn’t tossed and turned at night when they have a lot on their mind?), both are also rooted in inflammation,” said study author Jonathon K. Lisano, a postdoctoral research associate in the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/center/cuchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CUChange lab&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Colorado Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels of inflammation, which is generally not great, have been linked to both higher levels of anxiety and worsened sleep quality. With cannabis, particularly CBD, being able to impact inflammation we wanted to see if there was a relationship between cannabis use, inflammation, anxiety, and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 171 adults with at least mild anxiety. Of these, 147 were assigned to use one of three types of cannabis—THC + CBD (12% each), THC-dominant (24% THC, very low CBD), or CBD-dominant (24% CBD, very low THC)—while 24 participants served as a non-use control group. Participants in the cannabis groups purchased their assigned products from a dispensary and used them as much or as little as they wished over the four-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality at the start of the study and after four weeks. Blood samples were collected at both time points to measure concentrations of six pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were combined into a single inflammation score. The researchers examined whether cannabis use changed cytokine levels and whether starting levels of inflammation influenced the effects of cannabis on mood and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use did not significantly alter cytokine levels over the four-week period, regardless of the product type. “I was surprised to see that despite there being a decent amount of pre-clinical data on the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis, we did not observe any changes in inflammation over the 4 weeks of this study,” Lisano told PsyPost. “This could be due to those pre-clinical studies using much higher doses of CBD and THC than is obtainable for the average individual using cannabis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, initial inflammation levels played a notable role in shaping outcomes for mood and sleep. Participants using CBD-dominant or THC + CBD products experienced consistent improvements in overall negative mood scores—covering depression, anxiety, and stress—across all levels of baseline inflammation. These improvements were driven mainly by reductions in depression and anxiety, while stress levels showed little change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those using THC-dominant cannabis saw mood improvements only if their baseline inflammation was in the average range, with little or no benefit for participants with low or high inflammation. The non-use control group also showed some mood improvement, but it was less consistent and did not appear tied to changes in specific mood components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep quality showed a similar pattern. Cannabis users with average or high baseline inflammation tended to report better sleep after four weeks, particularly if they used CBD-rich products. For participants with low inflammation, improvements were smaller and less consistent. Those who did not use cannabis reported no meaningful changes in sleep quality regardless of their inflammation level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that CBD’s more consistent effects could be linked to its stronger anti-inflammatory actions compared to THC. Laboratory studies indicate that CBD may reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines by influencing pathways in immune cells, potentially stabilizing mood and sleep regulation across different inflammatory states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my big takeaways from these results are twofold,” Lisano explained. “1. Inflammation does appear to impact how cannabis affects our sleep and anxiety over time (which is the first time this has been reported). 2. Products containing higher amounts of CBD appeared to produce the most consistent reductions in anxiety and improvements in sleep quality. Products containing high amounts of THC had varied results, especially when it came to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s design had strengths, including a naturalistic approach that reflected real-world cannabis use and verification of product adherence through blood tests. However, the absence of a placebo control means some of the reported benefits could reflect participants’ expectations rather than purely pharmacological effects. Federal restrictions in the United States make placebo-controlled studies with legal-market cannabis challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are also limited to smoked or vaporized cannabis flower and may not apply to edibles, tinctures, or concentrates. Additionally, the study only covered a four-week period, so it is unclear whether the effects would persist, diminish, or change with longer-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the big thing people need to keep in mind is that these results are preliminary; one study is not the end-all be-all when it comes to the impact of cannabis on sleep and anxiety,” Lisano noted. “While we report that sleep quality got better over the 4 weeks, this is based on the participant’s subjective experience. Just because we feel like we are sleeping better doesn’t mean we actually got better sleep. There still needs to be more research using more objective data (i.e., sleep studies looking at sleep cycles and brain wave activity).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that future studies should examine how dose, frequency, and method of cannabis use interact with inflammation to influence mood and sleep. Longer-term research could also determine whether these benefits hold for individuals with more severe, clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping we can start to look at a few different things,” Lisano said. “It would be great to look at more objective data regarding sleep quality to assess if people are actually getting better quantifiable sleep versus just feeling like they are sleeping better. It would also be great to see what other aspects of health, like exercise, diet, etc., influence the effects of cannabis on things like anxiety, sleep, and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2025.1549311" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Inflammatory state moderates response to cannabis on negative affect and sleep quality in individuals with anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jonathon K.

			&lt;p&gt;Air conditioning can feel heaven-sent on hot summer days. It keeps temperatures comfortable and controls humidity, making indoor environments tolerable even on the most brutally warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some people avoid using air conditioning (AC) no matter how hot it gets outside, out of fear that it will make them sick. While this may sound far-fetched to some, as a microbiologist I can say this fear isn't altogether unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an air conditioning system malfunctions or isn't properly maintained, it can become contaminated with infectious microbes. This can turn your AC unit into a potential source of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;numerous airborne infections&lt;/a&gt; – ranging from the common cold to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sick buildings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/"&gt;"Sick building syndrome"&lt;/a&gt; is the general name for symptoms that can develop after spending extended periods of time in air-conditioned environments. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, congested or runny nose, persistent cough or wheeze, skin irritation or rashes, trouble focusing on work and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-rapid-surge-in-legionnaires-disease-linked-to-cleaner-air"&gt;Mysterious, Rapid Surge in Legionnaires' Disease Linked to Cleaner Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to occur in people who work in office settings, but can happen to anyone who spends extended periods of time in air-conditioned buildings such as hospitals. The symptoms of sick building syndrome tend to get worse the longer you're in a particular building, and are alleviated after you leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257240"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from India compared 200 healthy adults who worked at least six-to-eight hours per day in an air-conditioned office with 200 healthy adults who didn't work in AC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AC group experienced more symptoms consistent with sick building syndrome over the two-year study period – particularly a higher prevalence of allergies. Importantly, clinical tests showed those who were exposed to AC had poorer lung function and were absent from work more often, compared with the non-AC group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that AC office workers have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518424/"&gt;higher prevalence of sick building syndrome&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not work in an air-conditioned environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's suspected that one cause of sick building syndrome is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/74/Supplement_1/0/7707269"&gt;malfunctioning air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. When an AC unit isn't working properly, it can release allergens, chemicals and airborne microorganisms into the air that it would normally have trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning air conditioners can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231099002745"&gt;release chemical vapours&lt;/a&gt; from AC cleaning products or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap/refrigerant-safety"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; into the building's air. Chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde and toluene are toxic and can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171686/"&gt;irritate the respiratory system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorly maintained air conditioning systems can also harbour bacterial pathogens which can cause serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; is the bacteria that causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html"&gt;Legionnaires' disease&lt;/a&gt; – a lung infection contracted from inhaling droplets of water containing these bacteria. They tend to grow in water-rich environments such as hot tubs or air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170851" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642.jpg" alt="graphic of lung disease" class="wp-image-170851 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; can cause infection when inhaled in water droplets.

Symptoms usually begin to show between two and 14 days after being exposed to Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; infections&lt;/a&gt; can be life-threatening and often require hospitalisation. Recovery can take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fungal and viral infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of dust and moisture inside air conditioning systems can also create the right conditions for other infectious microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, research on hospital AC systems has found that fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhizopusspecies&lt;/em&gt; commonly accumulate within the water-rich areas of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;hospital ventilation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fungal infections can be serious in vulnerable patients such as those who are immunocompromised, have had an organ transplant or are on dialysis – as well as babies who were born premature. For example, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/environmental-control/air.html"&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;causes pneumonia, abscesses of the lungs, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and skin, and can also infect burns and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/"&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aspergillosis/"&gt;mostly respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and include persistent wheeze or cough, fever, shortness of breath, tiredness and unexplained loss of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral infections can also be caught from air conditioning. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121730259X"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that children in a Chinese kindergarten class were infected with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html"&gt;norovirus pathogen&lt;/a&gt; from their AC system. This caused 20 students to experience the stomach  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is usually transmitted through close contact with an infected person or after touching a contaminated surface, in this instance it was confirmed, unusually, that the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; was spread through the air – originating from the air conditioning unit in a class restroom. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160878/#:%7E:text=Vaporized%20material%20from%20infected%20person's,3%2C%207%2C%2015%5D"&gt;Several other cases&lt;/a&gt; of norovirus being spread this way have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, air conditioners can also help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/about/index.html"&gt;stop the spread of airborne viruses&lt;/a&gt;.

This can affect how well they prevent bacteria and fungi from getting in your body – and can leave you more vulnerable to developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5AB6706237E7ED5AF05FC19B9D4A88FC/S2633289223000017a.pdf/mouth-breathing-dry-air-and-low-water-permeation-promote-inflammation-and-activate-neural-pathways-by-osmotic-stresses-acting-on-airway-lining-mucus.pdf"&gt;deep-tissue infection&lt;/a&gt; of the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are designed to filter air contaminants, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the air we breathe indoors. But this protective shield can be compromised if a system's filter is old or dirty, or if the system isn't cleaned.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 30-day plan is set at 1,500 calories, with modifications for 2,000 calories. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each day provides at least 75 g of protein and 28 g of fiber for satiety. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes anti-inflammatory nutrients, such as fiber, healthy fats and antioxidants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Growing research links chronic inflammation to several health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even some autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although it's too simple to point to chronic inflammation as the only reason these diseases develop (other factors include genetics and the environment), it certainly motivates us to incorporate more anti-inflammatory nutrients into our diets. Foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;with inflammation-reducing benefits&lt;/a&gt; include antioxidant- and fiber-rich produce, such as berries and dark leafy greens, and foods with unsaturated fat, like salmon, nuts and seeds. This plan includes a month of meals and snacks incorporating the principles of the anti-inflammatory diet—let's get started.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-most-saved-anti-inflammatory-recipes-11703996" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 287 to 400 calories while the lunches span 342 to 460 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Which diet is closest to an anti-inflammatory diet?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet pattern is typically considered an anti-inflammatory diet. It focuses on loading up your plate with a variety of vegetables, fruits, fatty fish, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_627-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet is one that is full of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, plant-based proteins, fish, spices and herbs. These foods contain vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that help fight chronic inflammation in the body that can lead to disease. Foods that may contribute to inflammation are added sugars, processed meats and refined grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_628-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_629-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has consistently shown that eating foods that can help reduce or not contribute to the inflammatory process in the body can help reduce the risk of developing and accelerating chronic diseases such as cognitive decline, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create &lt;em&gt;EatingWell’s&lt;/em&gt; meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor.

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 A new wearable patch offers real-time blood pressure monitoring, revolutionizing how &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt; is managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 The device uses &lt;strong&gt;liquid metal&lt;/strong&gt; sensors and laser sintering to achieve precise measurements and high durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏃‍♂️ Suitable for patients and athletes, the patch provides continuous tracking, outperforming traditional &lt;strong&gt;cuff-based&lt;/strong&gt; monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📡 Researchers are integrating &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; and wireless technology to enhance accessibility and functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development in the field of medical technology, researchers have unveiled an innovative wearable patch designed to monitor blood pressure in real time. This device, a skin-mounted electronic patch, promises to revolutionize how hypertension is tracked and managed in daily life. As high blood pressure continues to affect more than 1.3 billion people globally, with only a small fraction effectively managing the condition, this new technology could be a game changer. The device’s ability to provide continuous monitoring and deliver hospital-grade accuracy could transform healthcare practices and enhance patient outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How the Patch Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new patch, similar in appearance to a bandage, offers a fresh approach to measuring blood pressure. Unlike traditional cuff-based monitors that are bulky and require inflation, this patch records the slight delay between the heart’s electrical signals and the mechanical pulse as blood flows through the arteries. The delay shortens when blood pressure rises and lengthens when it falls, providing an accurate measure of blood pressure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture these subtle movements on the skin, the patch utilizes a highly sensitive, flexible sensor made from liquid metal. This material remains fluid at room temperature, conducts electricity effectively, and possesses elasticity akin to human skin. Despite the challenges posed by its high surface tension, researchers successfully employed laser sintering to shape the liquid metal into precise circuits necessary for the patch’s function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cNaBYepRWA"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/this-is-the-coffee-maker-pc-you-wont-believe-exists-doug-macdowells-coffeematic-pc-uses-hot-brew-to-cool-its-cpu-in-stunning-tech-mashup/"&gt;“This Is The Coffee Maker PC You Won’t Believe Exists” Doug MacDowell’s Coffeematic PC Uses Hot Brew To Cool Its CPU In Stunning Tech Mashup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unmatched Durability and Precision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features of this patch is its durability. It can stretch up to seven times its original length and withstand over 10,000 cycles of stretching without performance degradation. In rigorous tests, the patch demonstrated superior accuracy in tracking rapid blood pressure changes, especially during and after exercise, outperforming conventional cuffs. This level of precision challenges the notion that blood pressure should only be measured during clinical visits and opens up new possibilities for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch holds promise not only for general use but also for specific applications such as intensive care monitoring and workplace safety. It provides a convenient solution for patients with hypertension, allowing them to track their condition easily throughout the day. Additionally, athletes and fitness enthusiasts may find value in monitoring how their blood pressure responds to various training routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yCDxxzABEX"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/trump-declares-war-on-china-and-woke-tech-as-his-90-point-action-plan-ignites-fierce-political-and-cultural-firestorm/"&gt;Trump Declares War on China and Woke Tech as His 90-Point Action Plan Ignites Fierce Political and Cultural Firestorm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Integrating Advanced Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the patch’s practicality, researchers are working on integrating it with advanced materials, wireless communication systems, and AI-driven analysis. These improvements aim to make the technology more accessible and user-friendly. Such integration could significantly impact the healthcare landscape by facilitating a shift towards smart healthcare solutions, wherein individuals can manage their health independently rather than relying solely on hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of this patch is poised to accelerate the adoption of smart healthcare technologies, enabling proactive disease prevention and management in daily life. By offering real-time insights and data analysis, the patch could contribute significantly to personalized healthcare strategies and improve overall health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XRVKFZgT96"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/virginia-techs-600k-robot-can-now-make-pizza-as-engineers-say-this-could-finally-give-millions-with-disabilities-their-independence-back/"&gt;Virginia Tech’s $600K Robot Can Now Make Pizza as Engineers Say “This Could Finally Give Millions With Disabilities Their Independence Back”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Implications for Global Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the patch gains recognition and adoption, its impact on global health could be profound. With hypertension being a leading cause of heart disease and stroke, continuous monitoring could play a crucial role in early detection and intervention, ultimately reducing the incidence of these life-threatening conditions. The accessibility and ease of use offered by the patch make it a practical option for a wide range of users, from patients managing chronic conditions to those interested in fitness and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Professor Seung Hwan Ko of Seoul National University, represents a significant advancement in wearable health technology. As the study gains attention in the scientific community, the potential for widespread implementation and acceptance grows. This innovation not only holds promise for individual health management but also offers a glimpse into the future of healthcare, where technology empowers people to take control of their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of this wearable patch marks a significant step forward in the battle against hypertension and related health issues. While the technology is still in its early stages, its potential to transform healthcare is undeniable. As researchers continue to refine and expand its capabilities, questions arise about how this and similar technologies will shape the future of medical monitoring. What other health innovations might emerge to further enhance our ability to manage and prevent diseases independently?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis showed that centenarians not only had lower rates of disease in late-midlife, they maintained this advantage throughout their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, at the age of 85, only four per cent of those who went on to live to 100 had experienced a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who died between the ages of 90 and 99, the figure was around 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, by the age of 100, just 12.5 per cent of centenarians had experienced a heart attack, compared to more than 24 per cent of those who died in their 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say this suggests they are not merely surviving serious illness better than others—they are avoiding it for much longer, and sometimes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this study, published in August last year, focused on more serious diagnoses of major diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate whether the key to longevity might also lie in avoiding less serious conditions, the team conducted a second study, which was published this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This analysis included 40 different medical problems, ranging from mild to severe, such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be due to genetic advantages, healthy lifestyle habits, environmental factors—or a combination of all three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team now plans to investigate which factors are most important, and how they influence health throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Mary Poppins actor Dick Van Dyke will turn 100 on December 13, 2025.

However, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.prevention.va.gov/Healthy_Living/Limit_Alcohol.asp" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says that if you want to stay within &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-year-unhealthy-moderate-drinking-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;healthy limits&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn't exceed more than seven drinks a week (one a day) if you're a woman and 14 (two a day) if you're a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a caveat, though: you should avoid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/123-drinking-rule-how-much-alcohol-too-much" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, defined as four or more drinks per occasion for women and people over 65, and five drinks for men. Yaranov said some of the "sickest hearts" he's seen in younger patients in those who drink too much at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patients "don't necessarily drink daily, but they go hard on the weekends," he said. Some might even stay sober throughout the week, working out every day and eating a balanced diet. But "this one day of heavy alcohol use, it's not going to go unnoticed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/how-does-alcohol-affect-the-heart" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; can cause a host of heart problems, from abnormal heart rhythms and heightened blood pressure to a greater risk of developing heart disease. The most common alcohol-related issue Yaranov sees is dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the heart's lower chambers become enlarged and weakened, unable to pump blood properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it's better to have a mid-week glass of wine than pound back shots on a Saturday night, Yaranov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1390c3be-a65e-4822-afc1-ebb30a4d03b8" data-toc-id="1390c3be-a65e-4822-afc1-ebb30a4d03b8"&gt;In some cases, smoking weed&lt;/h2&gt;

It's also difficult for researchers to isolate cannabis from other substance use, such as alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Yaranov said he sees lots of younger patients with heart issues who otherwise have no risk factors except for heavy marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With cannabis use as a daily habit, I think it's important for us to have this conversation now," he said. "A lot of times, this comes from this idea that it's harmless because it's an herb.

While athlete's heart isn't itself dangerous, it can mask or mimic more serious heart conditions, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sports-stars-who-cardiac-arrest-on-field-like-damar-hamlin-2023-1#marc-vivien-fo-died-during-a-2003-semifinal-match-from-an-undiagnosed-heart-condition-the-first-of-several-high-profile-soccer-deaths-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic condition that causes thickened heart walls and can lead to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/cardiac-arrest-vs-heart-attack" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this is very rare — you're more at risk of athlete's heart if you're a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-anti-covid-vaccine-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;highly skilled athlete&lt;/a&gt; than if you just went too hard at the gym a few times. The bigger heart issues might stem more from the rise-and-grind lifestyle of working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person frequently foregoes sleep to squeeze in those 5 a.m. workouts, they're increasing inflammation in their body, which is directly tied to cardiovascular risk. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sleep-in-longer-healthier-life-according-to-science-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; can also elevate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/health-effects-of-stress-2017-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to excess cortisol production, blood pressure elevation, and greater visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaranov said that healthy stress and sleep levels are harder to quantitatively measure than, say, your cholesterol.

But this shift comes with an unintended consequence: people may also begin to see other humans as less human, leading to a higher likelihood of mistreating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous agents have moved beyond purely functional roles. Virtual assistants can chat naturally, social robots can comfort patients, and large language models can engage in humanlike dialogue. These advances have been accompanied by a growing effort to give machines emotional intelligence—the ability to detect and respond to human emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this shift can make AI interactions more engaging and satisfying, the researchers wanted to explore a less obvious question: what happens to our perceptions of other people when we interact with emotionally capable machines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological research has long shown that the way we attribute mental capacities—such as the ability to think, plan, and feel—to others affects how we treat them. Emotional capacity, in particular, is seen as central to being human. The team theorized that when people encounter AI with humanlike emotional abilities, they may mentally group it closer to humans. Because AI is still generally perceived as having less of a mind than people, this mental “assimilation” could drag down humanness ratings of actual humans, leading to subtle forms of dehumanization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers called this phenomenon assimilation-induced dehumanization. They also wanted to know whether this effect could be mitigated, for example, if AI’s abilities were so extreme that people clearly saw them as nonhuman, or if the AI displayed only cognitive skills without emotional understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With recent technological advancements, we’ve been fascinated by how humanlike AI technologies have become—not just in what they can do, but in how they’re presented and how they interact with people,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/management/people/academic-staff/hye-young-kim" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Hye-young Kim&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of at the London School of Economics and Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that people respond to even subtle humanlike cues in AI, often treating them much like they would other humans. This led us to ask: while AI’s humanlike qualities clearly make machines seem more human, could they also make real people seem more like machines? Our research was driven by the idea that the more human we perceive AI to be, the more it may quietly reshape our understanding of what it means to be human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted five main experiments, supplemented with additional studies, involving both embodied AI (like humanoid robots) and disembodied systems (like customer service chatbots). Participants were exposed to AI agents with either high or low socio-emotional capabilities, then asked to evaluate the humanness of the AI and of real people. The researchers also measured behavior toward humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first study aimed to establish a basic link between perceiving socio-emotional ability in a robot and the willingness to mistreat human employees. For this experiment, 195 online participants were divided into two groups. One group watched a video of a humanoid robot, named Atlas, dancing energetically to music—a hedonic and expressive activity. The other group watched the same robot performing parkour—a more mechanical and utilitarian task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, all participants read three scenarios describing potentially negative changes to employee welfare, such as replacing workers’ hot meals with meal-replacement shakes, housing them in tiny “micro-capsule” rooms, and making them wear tracking devices to monitor their every move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants who watched the dancing robot perceived it as having more of a “mind” than those who watched the parkour robot. These same participants were also significantly more supportive of the harsh and dehumanizing workplace practices, like replacing meals and using invasive tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study was designed to get at the psychological mechanism behind the effect, testing the concepts of assimilation and contrast. The experiment involved 451 participants and again used the dancing and parkour robot videos to represent high and low socio-emotional capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a second factor was added: the robot’s capabilities were described as either moderate (similar to what was used in the first study) or extreme. In the extreme condition, the robot was said to have superhuman abilities like infrared, UV, and X-ray vision. After this exposure, participants completed a scale measuring their level of dehumanization, which assesses the extent to which people are seen as cold and mechanical or unsophisticated and animal-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study shed light on the boundary conditions of assimilation-induced dehumanization. When the robot’s capabilities were moderate and comparable to a human’s, the initial finding was replicated: seeing the emotional, dancing robot led to greater dehumanization of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the robot had extreme, superhuman abilities, the effect reversed. In that case, seeing the dancing robot made participants perceive people as more human. This suggests that when a machine is clearly in a different category from humans, we contrast ourselves against it, reinforcing our own humanity. But when the line is blurry, assimilation occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third study sought to pinpoint whether it was socio-emotional skills, specifically, or any advanced human-like skill that caused the effect. A group of 651 participants was divided into three conditions. They read about a fictitious artificial intelligence service. One group read about “EmpathicMind,” a virtual therapy program that could respond to subtle emotions. A second group read about “InsightMind,” a medical diagnosis program with powerful cognitive abilities to analyze complex data. A control group read about a simple survey analysis program. All participants then completed the same dehumanization scale from the previous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the third study confirmed that socio-emotional capability is the key ingredient. Only the “EmpathicMind” artificial intelligence, the one with emotional skills, led to increased dehumanization among participants. The highly intelligent “InsightMind” program, which had advanced cognitive but not emotional skills, produced no more dehumanization than the control condition. This demonstrates that it is the perception of a capacity to feel, not just to think, that triggers the assimilation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth study was constructed to directly measure the entire proposed chain of events and test it with a consequential choice. The 280 participants first read a fictitious article that framed artificial intelligence as either having remarkable emotional capabilities or having significant limitations in that area. They then used a slider scale to rate the “humanness” of both artificial intelligence agents and a typical person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the final part of the study, they were told they could win a $25 gift card and were asked to choose between one for Amazon or one for Costco. Before they chose, they read a real news article detailing Amazon’s allegedly dehumanizing working conditions. The researchers predicted that people who dehumanized workers would be less bothered by this information and more likely to choose the Amazon gift card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth study provided direct evidence for the full psychological process. Participants exposed to the emotionally capable artificial intelligence rated the technology as more human-like, and critically, they rated actual people as less human-like. This shift in perception had a real-world consequence: they were significantly more likely to choose the Amazon gift card, suggesting they were less troubled by the reports of poor employee treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final study aimed to demonstrate the effect within a specific company setting. A total of 331 participants read about a company’s new conversational virtual assistant for customer service. For one group, the assistant was described as having high socio-emotional skills, able to adapt its tone to a customer’s emotional needs. For the other group, its abilities were described as purely functional. Participants then rated the humanness of both the virtual assistant and a human customer service operator. As a behavioral measure, they were told they would receive a $0.25 bonus and were given the option to donate it to a fundraising campaign to support the mental health of the company’s human customer service agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth study replicated these findings in a direct consumer context. Participants who read about the emotionally intelligent virtual assistant perceived it as more human, which in turn led them to rate the human operator as less human. This translated directly into behavior: they were less likely to donate their bonus payment to a fund supporting the mental health of those same human employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more we perceive social and emotional capabilities in AI, the more likely we are to see real people as machine-like—less deserving of care and respect,” Kim told PsyPost. “As consumers increasingly interact with AI in customer-facing roles, we should be mindful that this AI-induced dehumanization can make us more prone to mistreating employees or frontline workers without even realizing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “this research does not suggest that AI itself is inherently harmful to the quality of our social experiences,” she added. “The issue arises when people unconsciously judge and compare humans and AI agents using the same standard of ‘humanness.’ While intentionally making AI appear more humanlike may help consumers feel more comfortable adopting and using it, we should be mindful of the unintended negative consequences that may follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors identify several avenues for future research to clarify and extend their findings on assimilation-induced dehumanization. One priority is to examine how the physical appearance of autonomous agents interacts with their perceived socio-emotional capabilities. The studies here focused on agents with limited humanlike embodiment, which likely minimized identity-threat effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suggested direction is to explore self-perception. The current work measured changes in perceptions of others, but it remains unclear whether interacting with emotionally capable AI would cause individuals to apply the same dehumanizing shift to themselves. One possibility is that people might accept less humane treatment in workplaces where AI is present, especially if the AI appears to match human socio-emotional abilities. Alternatively, they might engage in self-affirmation strategies, reinforcing their own humanness even if they dehumanize others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going forward, we’re interested in exploring how AI might influence not only how people treat others, but also how we see ourselves—and how that, in turn, shapes our values, preferences, and choices,” Kim explained. “Understanding how these effects unfold over time would be especially important as AI becomes increasingly embedded in our daily lives. Ultimately, we aim to shed light on the responsible design and deployment of AI technologies so they can enhance, rather than erode, our social relationships and human values.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1441" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AI-induced dehumanization&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hye-young Kim and Ann L.

Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to retract a large Danish study that found that aluminum ingredients in vaccines do not increase health risks for children, the journal's editor told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy has long promoted doubts about vaccines' safety and efficacy, and as health secretary has upended the federal government's process for recommending immunization. A recent media report said he has been considering whether to initiate a review of shots that contain aluminum, which he says are linked to autoimmune diseases and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study, which was funded by the Danish government and published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed nationwide registry data for more than 1.2 million children over more than two decades. It did not find evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines had caused an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The work is by far the best available evidence on the question of the safety of aluminum in vaccines, said Adam Finn, a childhood vaccination expert in the UK and pediatrician at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's solid, (a) massive dataset and high-quality data," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy described the research as "a deceitful propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry," and said the scientists who authored it had "meticulously designed it not to find harm" in a detailed Aug. 1 opinion piece on TrialSite News, an independent website focused on clinical research. He called on the journal to "immediately retract" the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I see no reason for retraction," Dr. Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy's piece, which was not submitted to the Annals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies - especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before," Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. "I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy had a number of critiques, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions - including those with the highest levels of exposure - and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link.

In its modern form, collagen supplements have been hyped for decades for purposes ranging from joint pain to hair thickness, despite a general lack of convincing evidence that they work. But interest has spiked over the past few years thanks to a burst of new research, and the latest study on the topic bolsters the claim that collagen might help build springier tendons and muscles to enhance explosive strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="publisher_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Collagen Might Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first wrote about the new wave of collagen research &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/gelatin-injury-prevention-recovery/"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and followed up with more &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/collagen-tendon-research-2023/"&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional view is that collagen-rich connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and cartilage are effectively inert, with very limited ability to grow or repair themselves after injury. What collagen proponents argue is that taking collagen supplements supplies the key building blocks—for example, an amino acid called proline—that trigger the synthesis of new connective tissue in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptical view is that collagen supplements are broken up into their constituent amino acids when you digest them, just like any other form of protein. As a result, they’re no more effective for building collagen in the body that, say, drinking a glass of milk (which also contains proline). There is, however, a bit of evidence that some collagen-specific peptides—short chains of amino acids—make it through the digestion process intact and show up in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex min-h-[250px] items-center justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2 lg:col-span-8 lg:col-start-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence for these claims and counterclaims has been decidedly mixed. Part of the problem is that most of the studies use some combination of collagen and specific exercise protocols in an attempt to maximize the benefits, in the same way that protein supplements are most effective for building muscle when combined with strength training. This is a good idea, but it makes it tricky to interpret conflicting results. Did the study fail because collagen doesn’t work, or because the exercise protocol was too easy or too hard, or too weird?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The New Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40623147/"&gt;The latest study&lt;/a&gt; comes from researchers at Japan’s Juntendo University—working, it should be noted, with scientists from Morinaga &amp;amp; Co., which manufactures and sells health and sports “food products.” Their goal was to simplify the picture by studying the effects of 16 weeks of daily ten-gram collagen peptide supplements, with no other changes in exercise or diet. They recruited 50 volunteers, half of whom got the supplement while the other half got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific hypothesis the researchers wanted to test was that collagen supplements would make tendons and muscles “stiffer,” in the sense that a stiff elastic band takes more force to stretch. This is what you’d expect if the collagen supplements trigger extra collagen formation in the tendons, which are primarily made of collagen fibers, and in the “extracellular matrix” that provides structural support to muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex min-h-[250px] items-center justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2 lg:col-span-8 lg:col-start-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stiffer muscles and tendons should allow you to transfer force more efficiently from your muscles to your bones, making it possible to deliver force more rapidly. You’re not getting stronger, but you’re getting more explosive. This sort of explosive power is crucial both for athletic performance and for activities of daily living like getting out of a chair—and (&lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/declining-muscle-power/"&gt;as I wrote last fall&lt;/a&gt;) is also what we tend to lose most rapidly as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What They Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, which were published in &lt;i&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/i&gt;, mostly support this hypothesis. They used MRI to measure the size of the Achilles tendon and part of the calf muscle; an ultrasound technique to measure the stiffness of the tendon and muscle; and a set of strength and power tests to see the functional effects of the supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the tendon nor the muscle got any bigger, and the maximum calf strength didn’t change. But the elastic stiffness of both muscle and tendon increased in the collagen group, while staying unchanged in the placebo group. Here, for example, is the stiffness (as measured by how fast an ultrasound wave travels) for the collagen and placebo groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2712685" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2712685" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A.jpg?width=730" alt="Collagen supplementation increased calf muscle stiffness." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Collagen supplementation increased calf muscle stiffness.&lt;/span&gt; (Illustration: Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, the collagen group also saw an increase in “rate of torque development,” which is a measure of explosive strength that quantifies how quickly you can apply force:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2712686" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2712686" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B.jpg?width=730" alt="Collagen supplementation increased explosive strength." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Collagen supplementation increased explosive strength.&lt;/span&gt; (Illustration: Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of the picture is that, for individual subjects, those who saw the biggest increases in muscle stiffness tended to see the biggest increases in explosive force. There wasn’t a clear connection between increases in tendon stiffness and increases in explosive force, but overall, the results support the chain of logic: more collagen -&amp;gt; stiffer muscles and tendons -&amp;gt; more explosive force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex min-h-[250px] items-center justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2 lg:col-span-8 lg:col-start-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the Results Mean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a much bigger argument on the basis of these results. Maybe you don’t care about tendons and explosive strength (though, honestly, &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/declining-muscle-power/"&gt;you should&lt;/a&gt;). But if these results are true, then it suggests that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; something special about eating collagen—that it’s not just broken down into a potpourri of loose amino acids, and that it can trigger the remodelling of cartilage-based tissues. Maybe it really will thicken your hair; maybe it will repair your joints; maybe it will accelerate your recovery from ligament injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are big and as-yet-unproven claims, but if collagen works for tendon stiffness, then the other claims become a bit more plausible, at least in theory. I remain skeptical but intrigued. Given the mess of conflicting results produced by previous research, a single study funded by a supplement company—even with a robust sample size of 50—doesn’t settle the question either way. But it suggests that this is a line of research that’s very much worth pursuing, and that we should await further results with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

A major analysis of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40699583/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;CARDIA &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;participants found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — things like brisk walking, cycling or swimming — often starts a steady decline about 12 years before a cardiovascular diagnosis, with the pace accelerating in the final two years. Experts including Dr. Sudhir Kumar (Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad) warn that this gradual loss of stamina is frequently misread as normal ageing; spotting it early creates a large window for prevention, screening and targeted lifestyle or medical interventions that can avert major cardiac events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical activity often starts falling 12 years before heart disease: Study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper titled “Trajectories of Physical Activity Before and After Cardiovascular Disease Events in CARDIA Participants” analysed physical activity data collected across decades from participants first enrolled in 1985–86. Researchers used repeated activity assessments (multiple timepoints through midlife) to model long-term trajectories and compare people who later developed cardiovascular disease (CVD) with those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key quantitative findings: MVPA began to decline, on average, roughly 12 years before a first CVD event; declines steeped in the two years immediately before diagnosis; and low activity levels tended to persist after the event, widening the gap versus peers who remained CVD-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used CARDIA’s longitudinal design to reveal this long preclinical window rather than a single cross-sectional snapshot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARDIA tracked moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — activities that raise heart rate and breathing noticeably (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, sports). In practice, MVPA estimates came from validated activity questionnaires administered repeatedly; these give a life-course view rather than a one-off reading. Because changes emerged gradually over a decade, the timing matters: a single clinic visit that notes “low activity today” can miss whether someone is on a downward trajectory. Longitudinal decline, especially an accelerating fall in MVPA is the important signal researchers flagged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes that raise &lt;keyword id="117152" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-disease-risk" source="Orion"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sustained drop in MVPA is not just a lifestyle statistic; it maps to several physiologic changes that raise cardiovascular risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac deconditioning: Less habitual activity reduces cardiac stroke volume and aerobic capacity, so daily exertion becomes harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endothelial and vascular changes: Lack of movement promotes poorer endothelial function and favours atherogenic plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic effects: Inactivity increases the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance and adverse lipid changes — all major drivers of atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and autonomic imbalance: Sedentary behaviour links to low-grade inflammation and less favourable autonomic (heart rate variability) profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these pathways mean a progressive drop in MVPA both reflects and contributes to the biological processes that eventually cause heart attacks or strokes. For public guidance, major health bodies emphasise staying active because of these mechanistic links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MVPA declines over time reflect race and gender inequalities in &lt;keyword id="612120" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-health" source="Orion"&gt;heart health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARDIA authors also examined demographic patterns. While MVPA tended to decline across all groups with age, the trajectory and baseline levels differed by sex and race. Notably, the study found that Black women recorded consistently lower activity levels across adulthood, and certain groups showed more continuous declines — patterns that can concentrate cardiovascular risk in already disadvantaged populations. These findings imply prevention must be tailored: population-level recommendations are necessary but insufficient without culturally and structurally appropriate supports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think longitudinally, not just cross-sectionally. A single “low activity” datapoint is less informative than a trend; clinicians should ask about changes in routine and stamina over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use risk tools alongside functional history. Tools such as the ASCVD Risk Estimator help assess 10-year risk, but trend information about MVPA can flag patients who might benefit from earlier screening or intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Act early. Declining MVPA constitutes a window for action — lifestyle counselling, targeted exercise support, and if indicated, medical risk-factor treatment (BP, lipids, glycemia). The earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of preventing an event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to evaluate a patient’s steady decline in stamina&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient reports a steady, unexplained fall in activity or stamina, reasonable initial steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic cardiovascular screening: blood pressure, BMI/waist measure, lipid panel, fasting glucose/HbA1c. Calculate ASCVD or other validated risk scores (for patients in the appropriate age range) to guide intensity of preventive therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional assessment: a simple timed walk or effort-tolerance discussion can be very revealing; refer for formal stress testing only if clinical suspicion of ischemia is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider social drivers: ask about work, caregiving, safety, access to safe walking spaces and time pressures — these often explain activity declines and must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From prevention to recovery: Practical guidelines for safe and sustainable cardiovascular fitness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health and cardiology bodies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) as a baseline goal for adults; more gives additional benefit. Practical tips to meet and sustain MVPA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break activity into short, consistent bouts (eg. , 30 minutes, 5 days/week).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose enjoyable activities (walking, cycling, swimming, dance) to improve adherence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build movement into routines (active commuting, stairs, standing breaks at work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set trajectory goals rather than single-day targets (track weekly MVPA minutes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address barriers (childcare, unsafe neighbourhoods, pain) with tailored solutions or supervised programs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone does have a cardiovascular event, the evidence strongly supports early referral to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR combines monitored exercise, risk-factor management, nutrition and psychosocial support; it reduces mortality and improves functional recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical guidance: begin activity gently (short walks) in hospital recovery, progress under supervision to 30+ minutes of aerobic activity several times weekly, and incorporate supervised outpatient CR when available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to track activity trends (tools that help detect a worrying decline)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearables and phone apps: track MVPA minutes and weekly totals. Look for a sustained downward slope over months/years, not day-to-day noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple logs: a weekly activity diary or 6-minute walk distance recorded every few months provides a low-tech trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical prompts: clinicians should routinely ask, “Compared with two years ago, do you find doing your usual activities harder?” A “yes” can prompt further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/boost-liver-function-with-this-gut-friendly-no-bake-date-bar-supporting-overall-wellness-gastroenterologist-shares-easy-homemade-recipe/articleshow/123230892.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Boost liver function with this gut-friendly no-bake date bar supporting overall wellness; gastroenterologist shares easy homemade recipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AJBVV95cUxQb0ZvX3kwVjFVQ0d0V2RCaFVocWZ6SFFXRTJuUHRSazdPRlYwUVN4a1AxeE9hZkkwTEItaVFOWEQ2ZzF0LXRJd2NCN3ZaZWRXS2RMai1QSy1rRG9aZzF5YnB5RVNwT3IzM3hObnVQTVZmQ25kTzBiT24zTHE1TUYzVFF4bTh2TjBldjd5c2NnZUxubVRiMzQ4dEk0ZWdMeWsxWkxkdHNWR1VDWXYyMm1vSzBUVDlJZTV0RlB6WTFnT0ZuQUNfV3ZPZ2xhaUUwUHpYRDN6Smc2U0pXUWs0UTFmaVRoWFpTRjlwNjg3QnhsR0Nvb0V4RldLSzBZbDZmOXV1T2s4d3ZzbmRkRU9ERXRYRy01TkRwaGQ0ZExJYXZnQnVsR3F4YVNHM3dkWnF2dGJkbEJGSlRtaUowaGo0a0czeFZCLWRmTUVlQVVPeXl4cV8</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic是否在消耗你的力量？研究显示令人惊讶的肌肉损失- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNejMzV3JTTHBBb1lxTExBOFB3SVNLcVVfeFJfWW9PYzV6MEl2cmc4ZHZEYnU4OWd0T0xrbjhNd2NmcnZYd2g2bjB6ejFGZ1RXRWw5VS1TbHAyNHhUZjQ4U0pNZlBCNHBsZF9rakhQWWxFRUlhak1vRHF1WGtoQUxrXy16dnI4d0k2bDFBdzRmSDVOWWxuYmx4MWlKNTE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:22:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNejMzV3JTTHBBb1lxTExBOFB3SVNLcVVfeFJfWW9PYzV6MEl2cmc4ZHZEYnU4OWd0T0xrbjhNd2NmcnZYd2g2bjB6ejFGZ1RXRWw5VS1TbHAyNHhUZjQ4U0pNZlBCNHBsZF9rakhQWWxFRUlhak1vRHF1WGtoQUxrXy16dnI4d0k2bDFBdzRmSDVOWWxuYmx4MWlKNTE</guid></item><item><title>最小加工食品与超加工食品：有什么区别？ - Yahoo News Canada</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOc1g1WVktbG1XeHFnSGFQVjUwS3EzNmlFdUFVdmg3SE5xZEJJYldsWUpYdUJKMS00TFZWNUhEenByd1FRZnJYNE5hYTdLWnNUQTAyLWlJd1dBMFlmTy1mT0J1b2xWbkpNU1hhRS03cmhEQnJpemd3cUtRSkFvek9hTjdweExodw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As U.S. health officials race to address Americans’ &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rfk-jr-waging-war-against-120116093.html" data-ylk="slk:consumption of ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;consumption of ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs), a new study further reveals their potential implications for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/meal-sequencing-health-experts-explain-110041376.html" data-ylk="slk:Diets that center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Diets that center&lt;/a&gt; minimally-processed foods offer more significant benefits for weight loss than diets that primarily consist of ultra-processed foods, a randomized crossover trial published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; concluded. But what exactly makes a processed food, ultra-processed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When it comes to processed foods, where you might start running into trouble is if you’re consistently eating foods that have been processed for the sake of enhancing their palatability, rather than nutritional content, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What exactly are processed foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Simply put, these are foods that have been altered in some capacity, says &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/amar-prakash-dave-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Amar Dave;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Amar Dave&lt;/a&gt;, a lifestyle medicine specialist with MedStar Health.

Take &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/soy-milk-good-know-protein-090050546.html" data-ylk="slk:fortified milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fortified milk&lt;/a&gt;, for example, where &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/actually-causes-vitamin-d-deficiency-110037326.html" data-ylk="slk:nutrients like vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;nutrients like vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and calcium can be added during processing to increase the milk’s nutrient profile. Really, the issue with processing begins “when we take away desirable nutrients, or add undesirable ones that could be harmful to us,” says Dave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers often define the different types of foods through the lens of the &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/5277b379-0acb-4d97-a6a3-602774104629/content" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA classification system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NOVA classification system&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of four categories: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods and ultra-processed foods. In research, the central benefit to the NOVA framework is that it allows experts to compare the results of cross studies, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3208/casey-m-rebholz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Casey Rebholz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Casey Rebholz&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case you missed: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/rfk-maha-commission-report-chronic-diseases/83768919007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:RFK slams processed foods, pesticides, vaccines as harmful to kids in sweeping MAHA report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;RFK slams processed foods, pesticides, vaccines as harmful to kids in sweeping MAHA report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What’s the difference between minimally-processed and ultra-processed foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Under the NOVA classification system, once a food is altered from its natural, edible form – whether by removing an inedible part of a vegetable, or freezing or &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/raisins-good-asked-dietitian-break-100053688.html" data-ylk="slk:dehydrating a piece of fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;dehydrating a piece of fruit&lt;/a&gt; – it’s considered minimally-processed, says Dave. This could look like a pack of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/healthiest-vegetable-isnt-one-best-110007678.html" data-ylk="slk:triple-washed spinach;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;triple-washed spinach&lt;/a&gt;, or a bag of frozen fruit (both of which offer significant benefits for health, and have minimal or no change to their nutrient content). “So, when health professionals are talking about limiting your consumption of processed foods, (minimally-processed foods) are not the type of foods they're talking about,” says Champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultra-processed foods rest on the other side of the spectrum. It's a more extensive “degree of processing of foods, in which the products really don't resemble the original food that was grown,” says Rebholz. Foods are considered to be ultra-processed when they’re processed through industrial methods, or contain a variety of additives (including &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/04/23/food-dyes-banned-phased-out-rfk-fda-hhs/83230760007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:artificial colors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;artificial colors&lt;/a&gt;, flavorings, emulsifiers and preservatives), says Dave. Pastries, cookies, sugary drinks, cakes and pre-prepared meals are among a few common examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK Jr. is cracking down on 7-OH. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rfk-jr-cracking-down-7-100405738.html" data-ylk="slk:What is kratom – and how addictive is it?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;What is kratom – and how addictive is it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Should I limit my intake of ultra-processed foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Generally speaking, ultra-processed foods are going to be higher in salt, fat and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cereal-good-watch-added-sugars-090401730.html" data-ylk="slk:added sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;, says Champion. This trifecta of ingredients makes ultra-processed foods &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; palatable, and therefore, easy to eat a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When our diet is high in ultra-processed foods, we’re often not consuming enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/articles/latest-trendy-diet-actually-healthy-090744457.html" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, lean protein and essential vitamins and minerals, explains Champion. “You also end up overconsuming calories, which can lead to weight gain,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While more clinical trials need to be conducted on the long-term implications of eating ultra-processed foods, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; clear links between certain ingredients commonly found in ultraprocessed foods, and negative health outcomes. “When you're adding sugar, sweeteners, preservatives and saturated fats (to food), you are now increasing your risk of long-term chronic disease – specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/02/23/diabetes-causes-prevention-types/11110994002/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cancers, high cholesterol and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/26/heart-disease-top-killer-what-to-know/77900599007/#:~:text=More%20than%20700%2C000%20Americans%20died,%2C%20come%20down%20with%20it.%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many Americans still get the majority of their daily calories from eating ultra-processed foods, according to newly published data by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db536.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, understanding the difference between minimally-processed and ultra-processed foods is paramount, underscores Dave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Remember, eating “an ultra-processed food here and there is unlikely to really cause a problem in your health,” says Champion. What’s most important to consider is your dietary pattern as a whole, and prioritize filling your diet with whole and minimally-processed foods, Champion recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/11/what-are-processed-foods/85554799007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What are processed foods?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that eating french fries three times a week or more is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other preparations of potato did not yield the same degree of risk, indicating that it's the cooking method that's the primary culprit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutritional guidelines and a dietitian emphasize that potatoes can still provide valuable nutrition, including fiber, potassium, and vitamin C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you love them baked, mashed, roasted, grilled, or stuffed, potatoes are popular all across America — and the world. But if you love your spuds in fry form, you might want to pause before firing up the deep fryer or placing that next fast-food fry order, because researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health just uncovered some potential health implications from this popular dish. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new study, published this week in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj-2024-082121" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;The British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that eating french fries three times a week was associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to eating them less than once a week. This is a valuable insight considering that about 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/statistics/about-diabetes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Harvard team analyzed data from four decades of 205,107 adults in the United States who didn’t have diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer when the study began. The takeaway? The risk for developing type 2 diabetes wasn’t the potato’s fault on its own. Instead, it came down to how this humble ingredient was prepared, with deep-fried potatoes yielding the worst results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes are considered a vegetable and can be included in a healthy eating plan, according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) 2020–2025 &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Potatoes are a staple in many cultural diets across the globe and can absolutely be considered a ‘healthy’ addition to the diet,” says registered dietitian and certified personal trainer &lt;a href="http://www.shawsimpleswaps.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, MS, RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, an author and nutrition communications strategist. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes are naturally fat-free and sodium-free, in addition to containing fiber, protein, and other key vitamins and minerals. For reference, one medium &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/i/usda/potatoes-boiled-cooked-in-skin-flesh-without-salt-1-potato-2-0.5-dia-sphere/513fceb575b8dbbc21001671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;cooked potato&lt;/a&gt; with the skin on contains 118 calories, 0.1 grams of fat, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of dietary fiber, and 2.5 grams of protein. It also provides 515 milligrams of potassium and is a source of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/potatoes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-the-way-you-cook-potatoes-really-change-how-they-affect-your-body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can the way you cook potatoes really change how they affect your body? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to researchers, yes. This study found no significant diabetes risk associated with potato preparations such as baked, boiled, and mashed tubers or even potato chips. The only culprit? French fries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; French fries are typically deep-fried in oil, heavily salted, and in some cases made with added flours, sugars, or preservatives. Take &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/small-french-fries.html#accordion-c921f9207b-item-283bee7dbd" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;McDonald’s&lt;/a&gt; famous fries, for example. In addition to potatoes and vegetable oil, they include beef flavoring, dextrose (a simple sugar), sodium acid pyrophosphate (an additive), and salt. One large order packs in 480 calories, 23 grams of fat, and 400 milligrams of sodium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-the-most-nutritious-way-to-cook-a-potato"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is the most nutritious way to cook a potato? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To start, keeping the skin on potatoes for serving is an excellent choice because this is where you’ll find the most fiber. “Increasing dietary fiber has been linked to improved health outcomes, including better blood sugar control, weight management, and more,” explains Shaw.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She adds that the cooking method matters too, saying, “It’s best to consider the cooking method if they’re a daily part of your diet, opting for boiled, baked, air-fried, or roasted over deep-fried options.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what should a fry lover do? Shaw recommends making homemade fries and cooking them in an air fryer. “Slicing them into steak-size fries with a spritz of olive oil and salt yields that same restaurant-quality texture and taste without the fat and calories of a traditional french fry,” she notes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/mashed-potatoes-recipes-6406547" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mashed potato&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/baked-potato-7559551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt; fans can also make a few smart swaps if desired. Instead of opting for a pat of butter or using full-fat sour cream and cheese, try mixing in Greek yogurt or light sour cream for that same creamy taste with less saturated fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-is-too-much-potato"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How much is too much potato? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A medium potato, or about 5 ounces, is the standard serving size… Think about the size of a small fist,” advises Shaw. How often you enjoy potatoes will depend on your individual nutritional needs and health goals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Personally, I recommend variety in my clients' diets, encouraging them to alternate between russets, sweet, and red potatoes to get their potato fix in while providing their body with a variety of nutrients,” she suggests. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy potatoes daily, that’s okay too. “It really depends on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you’re enjoying them (like baked over fried) and alongside what other nutrient-dense foods.” Shaw recommends pairing potatoes with healthy fats and protein to help support balanced blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What it boils down to is that there’s no need to shun potatoes from your kitchen. Just pay attention to preparation methods, limiting deep-fried french fries and opting for air-fried, boiled, baked, roasted, or mashed potatoes when possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And as always, if you’re concerned about whether or not potatoes are a good addition to your diet — and especially if you’re concerned about diabetes — it’s best to talk with a health professional who can ensure your nutrition meets your personal needs.&lt;br&gt;

Rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential nutrients, mangoes may improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate glucose levels, especially in overweight or obese individuals. One controlled trial demonstrated that daily mango consumption led to improved insulin response and stable body weight compared to other calorie-matched snacks. Despite their natural sugar content, moderate intake of mangoes as part of a balanced diet can support metabolic health. Including fresh mango regularly might be a simple, nutritious way to aid blood sugar management and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mango benefits for type 2 diabetes: Study shows improved blood sugar control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 8-week randomised controlled trial conducted by Fortis C-DOC Hospital and the National Diabetes, Obesity, and Cholesterol Foundation (N-DOC), New Delhi, assessed the effects of mango intake in adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants consumed 250 grams (roughly one small mango) of Safeda or Dasheri mango every morning at breakfast, while a control group ate an equal portion of white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40761695/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that the mango groups experienced significantly better blood sugar control, including lower fasting blood glucose levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity, meaning their bodies used insulin more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants showed reductions in HbA1c levels, a key marker for long-term blood sugar management. The glycaemic index of mango was notably lower than that of white bread (70–75), highlighting mango as a favourable option for glycaemic control when consumed mindfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mango also supports heart, gut, and metabolic health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond blood sugar benefits, regular mango consumption is linked to improved digestion, reduced cholesterol, enhanced skin and hair health, stronger immune function, and decreased oxidative stress. These advantages stem from mangoes’ high fibre content, powerful antioxidants such as mangiferin, and vital vitamins and minerals. Moreover, mangoes help regulate blood pressure and cholesterol levels, promoting cardiovascular and metabolic wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Health risks: Not a cure, but a supportive dietary choice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mango offers many nutritional benefits, it should not be viewed as a cure for diabetes. Due to its moderate glycaemic index and natural sugars, excessive or unbalanced mango consumption could cause blood sugar spikes, especially in people with diabetes. Experts recommend moderation, consuming mango in small portions, pairing it with proteins or healthy fats, and avoiding eating it on an empty stomach. These habits help slow sugar absorption and reduce glycaemic impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practical tips for enjoying mango for health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Portion control: Start with half a cup of fresh mango to enjoy sweetness without excess sugar intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose fresh: Fresh mango is preferable over dried or processed types, which often contain added sugars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair wisely: Combine mango with protein-rich foods (like yoghurt or nuts) or healthy fats to help stabilise blood glucose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor effects: Those with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar response and consult healthcare professionals for personalised advice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.

Symptoms include loud snoring and making gasping or choking noises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thirty people living with the disorder and aged between 19 and 65 were involved in the trial, led by researchers at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About half of the group were taught how to use the shell, while the others carried out deep breathing exercises. Both groups were encouraged to practise their techniques for at least 15 minutes, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Six months later, the trial found that those who had practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the day. They also had higher blood oxygen levels during the night, and four to five fewer OSA episodes an hour on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication,” said Dr Krishna K Sharma, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common form of treatment for sleep apnoea is a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machine, which involves patients wearing a mask that blows pressurised air into the nose and throat while asleep. Previous research has also found that playing a woodwind instrument could help with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the machines are effective, they can be uncomfortable, leading the researchers to suggest that shankh blowing could be a promising alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A larger trial involving several hospitals is being planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The findings of this trial are encouraging, but the small scale of the trial means it’s too soon to say for certain that conch blowing can help people manage their obstructive sleep apnoea,” said Dr Erika Kennington, the head of research and innovation at Asthma + Lung UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s also not clear from this research why blowing through a conch shell regularly might improve someone’s symptoms. It would be good to see the conch blowing approach tested on a larger scale and compared with other proven strategies, such as limiting alcohol, staying active and maintaining good bedtime habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“OSA is a long-term condition, but with the right treatments and lifestyle changes, people can make a real difference to their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZER1T0txSEJvZXV2cWU3TWJ1SDdOMVNXMlNsTXN3TUlRalVaUy05SkJUYmxNS0VhZWJOMzFUQkM4YkJjWkVzR0RINUgwZkhqNnpqS2tJZXByWUEzQ1M1aDFGd0xYUjRMZ2RXVmhaY2xFMnpGMmhsUEtLQjhFUTg2Q3NzS19ncGVTUmNxOExHbnYxajBucXRVZFpvWGlqWHJ0MXZxLXBKOTJxTjU5anhUWHVhaw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，心脏病可以在胆固醇或血压升高警报之前十年开始：如何识别-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwJBVV95cUxNYlh4MUlaNWlrMThoaTRvd0hZWEIyQjJ1allkTGlVekJVR2cwbU9JbVFucHdwWFNiMTlPV0FIeXJVLW15QWtod1hVaGIyclVfOXFHbjRNSUJmWlRRQ25aYVpaODdDWWxOYjA4WUhoamRXaWJWQVkwMDlQOVJSbjFNWU4zRDBUUW9ZcHFzMUppWDUtTTRoZERoZEpxTDNrYmVfTVBZS1BDdlQ1U01mNXVOT3FWWXlNelNMNW5VMlExNk5DYU9MNVlkeUp0ZDVuc293enVwNG5CUENuUU4tMkx1OGxOMEpIRXBnc2F4bHdZclY5cDJwZHIzb2hIOUxTT2hCMU0wVHNtS2RXRUV6emFrQVVBQzhYV25XZXAyMzduMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're cruising through your 20s and 30s, enjoying life, maybe hitting the gym or walking the dog. Then, without a dramatic event, your energy starts to dip. You move less, sleep more, skip workouts more often—not because you’re lazy, but because life gets busy, health shifts, or routines change. This downward trend isn’t just a sign of ageing—it might be an early whisper from your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836452" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;in JAMA Cardiology has surfaced this subtle red flag: people who later developed heart-related conditions, like heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure, actually showed a dip in their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) around 12 years before their diagnosis. That’s more than a decade of downshifting before things got serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what they found: across more than 3,000 adults tracked from their mid-20s into late middle-age, physical activity naturally tapered off over time. That’s kinda expected but those who eventually ended up with cardiovascular disease (CVD) experienced a sharper, earlier drop in activity, especially about two years before the actual diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause on that: this decline started way before any red flags in your cholesterol or blood pressure, before you knew something was off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like the heart sending a whisper, not a shout. And that gives us a huge window to act, to course-correct—and maybe even stop things from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to the story. The study also unpacked how this trend varies across different groups. That’s a big red flag pointing at inequities in opportunity, support, access, things like safe places to exercise, affordable options, flexible schedules—all the real-world stuff that shouldn’t be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease is still the big boss of health problems in the US, and not in a good way&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart diseases are the leading cause of death for both men and women, claiming about 1 in 5 lives each year. Millions of Americans are walking around with risk factors, some they know about, some they don’t. High blood pressure? That’s more than 120 million adults. High cholesterol? Over 90 million. And then there’s diabetes, obesity, smoking, stress, and sitting way too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s sneaky is how common it all is. You can be in your 40s, feeling “fine,” and still have silent plaque building in your arteries. Lifestyle plays a massive role, processed food, too much salt and sugar, and not enough daily movement are basically an open invitation to heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? Most of these risks can be lowered. Eat better, move more, keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in check, and quit smoking if you do. The heart might be complicated, but it also responds fast to healthier choices. In other words, you’ve got more control over your heart health than you might think—so start taking care of it now, not when the first scare hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the takeaway? Let’s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Physical activity as a canary in the coal mine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your movement starts tapering, especially consistently and long term, it might not be just busy life. It could be an early signal of strain on your cardiovascular system. And studying that decline gives us a huge head start to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep moving, always&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for a crisis. Starting good movement habits early isn't just about losing weight or staying fit, it’s about keeping your heart talking to you softly, not screaming when it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tailored support matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that not everyone has the same chances to stay active means we need targeted help, especially for those groups hit hardest: think community-friendly parks, local affordable classes, supportive healthcare advice that’s tailored, not generic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recovery isn’t optional&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once someone is diagnosed, getting back to movement, even slowly, is critical. Post-heart-event life doesn’t mean sitting on the couch indefinitely. Unfortunately, the study found most people stayed below recommended activity levels even after a diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of this like screening, not just with blood tests, but with lifestyle checks. If doctors, communities, and people start paying attention to when your activity starts to drop, that could become a real, actionable early warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the heart has a way of speaking quietly before it shouts. That gradual slowdown in your daily energy or activity? It might be worth listening to. Let’s keep our bodies moving, not just for now, but for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwJBVV95cUxNYlh4MUlaNWlrMThoaTRvd0hZWEIyQjJ1allkTGlVekJVR2cwbU9JbVFucHdwWFNiMTlPV0FIeXJVLW15QWtod1hVaGIyclVfOXFHbjRNSUJmWlRRQ25aYVpaODdDWWxOYjA4WUhoamRXaWJWQVkwMDlQOVJSbjFNWU4zRDBUUW9ZcHFzMUppWDUtTTRoZERoZEpxTDNrYmVfTVBZS1BDdlQ1U01mNXVOT3FWWXlNelNMNW5VMlExNk5DYU9MNVlkeUp0ZDVuc293enVwNG5CUENuUU4tMkx1OGxOMEpIRXBnc2F4bHdZclY5cDJwZHIzb2hIOUxTT2hCMU0wVHNtS2RXRUV6emFrQVVBQzhYV25XZXAyMzduMA</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：男性和女性症状和风险因素的差异-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPbXVSa05PTENwaGxEOU9UUTd1YmFROWEtcGVlbU1NS0tHSXBxWl9BUjNFc21vTWRKTkFjeDVWeWRwX1RVNHhtLWQyTnZnYjJiZ18ta2NmUER5S054YUhQenMxYzBNelctb2VfZHdUdzBtQzNHMjg2UzBBX3hBeUROaWVrYXF2S0FYQUNhWFBWVy1WaEhaXzRsa0VSaXVsSGJWeG9tVVNabGY5VTNicFo3ZEN0dnhqc3ZJa3NBdWFZN1NMQVJsZzhUZm9ZSDVxMldaOV9iV3lCTmpYTGVXaVo3c1VTenh0bG92S1Z0bVY0SGo4cy02RTNQMy1n0gH_AUFVX3lxTFB5RjlsRHRXR2JqQmFiYjVEcVdJRk9rUHFPUGpmZ2tadkt2TE9leUlSR2NBbjEyemlFN0pWV0QwTWE0UXE5dUQzVHVNZmxyRzUwTlVFdnNVaEVTM2lFLTFYTnRjT2FyaE1UajZ5Q2VpOW04UmM1dFprQWpJU0haNGhhdnA3YkxwRDZqQ2RMQ19DOWdwQkxPTklLRzhWVk9RZ19YN18yR0lqU0hZSXplM3RxMFlYM0M2MVVROGhodTIyQjNFejc3aWxJZmZFdWJxc1l1MXc3bmlVVDVIRVZfU0RqcFNrWVBUSUJ2bkl1ZzkyOEQtLWtZb0FxbUZHWlQ3MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is one of the most common types of cancer in both men and women around the world. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults. In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although colon cancer affects both men and women, it’s not the same for everyone. While symptoms like changes in bowel habits or blood in the stool are shared, the risk factors, tumor location, and outcomes can differ by sex. Men face higher rates overall and higher death rates, while women more often develop cancer in parts of the colon that are harder to spot early. Hormones like estrogen, body weight, lifestyle habits, and genetic differences all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is colon cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, when it includes the rectum, develops in the cells lining the large intestine. It usually begins as benign polyps, which can turn cancerous over time.

These right-sided tumors often remain flat, are less visible, and hence harder to detect in colonoscopy. Right-sided colon cancer tends to be more aggressive and is often diagnosed at a later stage, which may lead to worse survival outcomes in older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologically, these right-sided tumors often exhibit traits like microsatellite instability (MSI) or CpG island methylation (CIMP), molecular patterns more frequently seen in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men more commonly develop left-sided growths, which tend to form polyps and are easier to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hormones, biology, and the microbiome: Estrogen’s role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological and genetic factors also play a vital role.

Poor diets, obesity, alcohol, and low calcium were key risk factors in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, younger women under 50 face &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;an 82% higher incidence rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared to men in the same age group. Late diagnoses are common in this group due to assumptions that young people are low-risk. Reports also link the rise among younger populations to obesity, Western diets, sedentary habits, alcohol, and fatty liver, but men appear more affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening and prevention: One size doesn’t fit all&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early screening and why it helps: Detecting colon cancer early saves lives.

Men generally face higher risk and death rates, while women, especially older ones, often develop more aggressive right-sided tumors that are harder to catch early. Hormonal factors, gut microbiome interactions, and lifestyle habits shape these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fight colon cancer most effectively, we need both shared and sex-aware approaches like encouraging healthy diets, regular exercise, limiting alcohol and smoking, and promoting early screening starting in mid-forties.

I just didn’t think it would come for me so soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A doctor consoling a woman (stock image).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Young-onset Alzheimer's disease is an uncommon form of dementia that affects people younger than age 65. The condition also is called early-onset Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people with Alzheimer's are age 65 and older. About 1 in 9 people age 65 and older in the United States has Alzheimer's disease. About 110 of every 100,000 adults between ages 30 and 64 have young-onset Alzheimer's," the site adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly's father had revealed she and her siblings had a 50/50 chance of getting Alzheimer's disease in January 2020, per &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/in-limbo-queensland-mum-diagnosed-with-rare-form-of-alzheimers-at-29/news-story/08d5d953e408d7472262db0558240393" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news.com.au;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;news.com.au&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Originally I think I was in a little bit of denial, and I originally said I didn’t want to know,” she said, according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sort of stuck my head in the sand and just pretended it wasn’t happening for probably the first three years, until I decided that I needed to do something about it," Kelly added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A doctor (stock image).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scans revealed the first signs of damage to Kelly's neurons, which are cells in the brain that send messages all over the body, in June, 7News noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve started to notice small changes already,” Kelly told the outlet of already noticing symptoms. “Forgetting words and mixing words together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be thinking of something, and I’ll just mush the words together," she added. “It’s things I didn’t do previously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly said of her daughter Evie, “We’re not exactly sure how or what to tell her yet. She’s still so young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She will get some information, but we want to protect her for as long as we can," she continued, per the outlet. “The goal is to see her finish school, get married. I want to make sure she’s an adult before I die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly's stepsister, Jessica Simpson, started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/give-erin-more-time-with-her-daughter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; page to help raise money for treatment, claiming that Kelly had been "told she’s too young to qualify for clinical trials in Australia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a treatment called Leqembi. It’s not a cure, but it could slow the progression and give Erin more time — to keep working, keep functioning, and most importantly, keep being Evie’s [mom] for as long as she can," Simpson wrote on the page.

It’s terminal. And it’s already starting to affect her life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people don’t associate Alzheimer’s with someone so young — someone still packing school lunches, doing bedtime stories, and showing up every day for her child. But this is Erin’s reality. And sadly, it’s progressing fast," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpson insisted, "Erin isn’t asking for a miracle — she knows there’s no cure in time for her. She’s simply asking for more time. More ordinary days. More little moments. More memories Evie can carry with her when Erin no longer can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic says it is rare for young-onset Alzheimer's to be "caused by a specific error in a gene, called a genetic mutation," which "can be passed from parent to child": "Three different genes may have a mutation that causes young-onset Alzheimer's disease. These genes are APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSEN1 is the genetic mutation that Kelly inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A person who inherits at least one copy of a mutated gene will likely develop Alzheimer's disease before age 65," the Mayo Clinic adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About 11% of people with young-onset Alzheimer's carry a genetic mutation that causes disease. But among all people with Alzheimer's disease, fewer than 1% carry one of these causal genes," the site states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Simpson for an update on Kelly's diagnosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-reveals-heartbreaking-symptoms-diagnosed-rare-form-alzheimers-disease-11785662" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:01:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBnRUxxTFRlc3hZMUpwSVk3SE9NZlF5RFB3Mm11bENNaE1iUlpEU0xZU2pMM0JDeVdYN01IYVRtNjFfTE9fQ1NsMG5nY0RnR0lHdklQODM0aHl5R2pRakNCNWZkMmZnaTlzZEdWclV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>活到100岁的人与疾病有着独特的关系- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNRW1Ial9YcXJaSVF4SzFLaHE4QXI1eUJvbi1GNWRFUkstWjhMejNub1lBOEluUVEtQmstSUl6X1ZsOXZhQ2loR1l2NVVGRk1ncE5ZZm9jN3RET2VjRURTY2NxVmQyNGJ1U2c0MFBBVEUxaXZISjZqVDN4dTNYbjN5MVJzd1ZidWF6WEktY2JxT2E2RklNWlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Humans may be &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy"&gt;living longer on average&lt;/a&gt; these days, but, even so, only a fraction of us will live to see our 100th birthday. Yet the reasons why only a select few will become centenarians still remains a mystery to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest work published by myself and my colleagues has just uncovered one factor that may be key to the long lives that centenarians experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research team has found that people that live to 100 seem to possess the superhuman ability to avoid disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;Want to Live Past 100? Experts Recommend These Four Habits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians are of such great interest to scientists because they may hold the key to understanding how we can live longer – and live longer in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some questions researchers have long pondered is whether one of the keys to a centenarian's resilience mainly lies in their ability to postpone major diseases, or whether they're simply better at surviving them. Or, could it be that they avoid certain diseases altogether?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the answer to these questions would bring us at least one step closer to figuring out what specific factors contribute to longevity. So my colleagues and I set out to see if we could find the answers. In two recent studies, we analysed and compared long and shorter-lived people born in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the two studies showed that centenarians not only suffer from fewer diseases overall throughout their lives, they also develop them more slowly. They're also less likely to experience deadly conditions, such as major cardiovascular disease, compared to their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01330-w"&gt;The first study&lt;/a&gt; included 170,787 people born in Stockholm County, Sweden between 1912 and 1922. Using historical health data, residents were followed for 40 years – either from age 60 until their death, or up to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculated each participant's risks of stroke, heart attack, hip fracture and various cancers, and compared those who survived to the age of 100 with their shorter-lived counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that centenarians not only had lower rates of disease in late-midlife, but they continued to have lower rates of disease throughout their life overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the age of 85, only 4% of those who lived to be centenarians had experienced a stroke. In comparison, around 10% of those who almost became centenarians – living to ages 90–99 – had experienced a stroke by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, despite living longer, their lifetime risk for most diseases never reached those of their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 100, 12.5% of centenarians had experienced a heart attack, compared to just over 24% among people who lived between the ages of 80 and 89. This suggests that centenarians delay – and in many cases even avoid – major age-related diseases, rather than simply surviving them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study is that it only focused on analysing more serious diagnoses of major diseases. But what if the real key to longevity isn't that centenarians avoid disease entirely – rather, it's that they're able to avoid developing serious diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, we conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00328-1/fulltext"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; that included 40 different medical conditions. These conditions ranged from mild to severe – such as hypertension, heart failure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at 274,108 participants who were born between 1920 and 1922 and who lived in Sweden. We followed participants for around 30 years – either from the age of 70 until their death or until they turned 100. A total of 4,330 people became centenarians – just 1.5% of the participants we looked at for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg" alt="doctor listening to man's heart" class="wp-image-170828 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Centenarians were less likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;Gabriella Csapo/corelens/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after including a wider range of diseases and allowing participants to have more than one health condition in the analysis, our team came to the same conclusions as we did in the first study: centenarians developed fewer diseases – and their rate of disease accumulation was slower across their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that centenarians were more likely to have conditions limited to a single organ system. This is a sign of this group's health and resilience, since diseases that affect one organ system are much easier to treat and manage in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, while cardiovascular conditions were the most common diagnoses across all age groups, centenarians were less likely overall to be diagnosed compared to their short-lived companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 80, around 8% of centenarians were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. In comparison, more than 15% of people who died at the age of 85 had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease by 80 years of age. The lower rates of cardiovascular disease appear to be central to the centenarians' extended survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians also demonstrated greater resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions – such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and dementia – throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg" alt="Centenarian with flowers" class="wp-image-170829 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions could be a secret to a longer life. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;EyeJoy/Getty Signature Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most centenarians eventually developed multiple health conditions, they did so much later in life than non-centenarians – usually around the age of 89. This was thanks to having fewer diseases and a slower rate of disease accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, non-centenarians typically experienced a sharp increase in the number of health conditions they suffered with in the final years of their lives. But centenarians did not experience this same sharp decline in health – even from their 90s onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The secret to a long life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that centenarians manage to delay, and in some cases avoid, disease despite living longer is both intriguing and encouraging. It shows it's possible to age more slowly than is typical – and challenges the common belief that a longer life inevitably comes with more disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that exceptional longevity isn't just about postponing illness but reflects a distinct pattern of ageing. But whether this is mainly due to genetics, lifestyle, environment or a combination of these factors remains unknown. The next step in our research will be to explore what factors predict living to 100 – and how such predictors operate during a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms behind healthy ageing in centenarians may offer valuable insights for promoting longer, healthier lives for all.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262645/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a small trial undertaken by a specialist team of researchers in India , 30 people aged between 19 and 65 with OSA were encouraged to blow into a conch shell for a mimimum of 15 minutes, five days a week, with remarkable results uncovered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also reported an average four or five less apnoeas, where breathing is paused during sleep at night, per hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharma described shankh blowing as a 'distinctive' exercise that 'involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining how the decades-old method works, Dr Sharma added: 'This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The shankh’s unique spiralling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medical expert explained that the technique is simple, low-cost and will help provide a snoring remedy that moves away from medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the success of the initial study, the team of researchers are now planning a larger trial that is set to involve several hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hope, Dr Sharma adds, is that it will help the team 'assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods', alongside determine whether it can help assist those with the 'most severe forms of OSA'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The innovative new study comes as amid shocking new research that suggested those suffering with OSA could trigger lung cancer, with a 'significant' link uncovered between the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who blew into the shell for six months were found to be 34 per cent less sleepy during the day and also had better quality of sleep than those who practised deep breathing exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jowan Al-Nusair, study co-author and physician at Marshall University told the Daily Mail it was 'one of the first statistically significant studies' to prove a link between the condition and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While further studies are definitely now needed to investigate just how the significant the link truly is, this suggests OSA may be a preventable risk factor for lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We should be more closely monitoring patients with OSA. Patients would definitely benefit from screening and early intervention to combat OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additional studies are essential to understand exactly why OSA may increase this risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaHlJRFZ3VjZWNTJYZGpJNERQZmpzcWc2eExxN3Q2dzI3V253N0FGVlZtU05ZZ0gzS2hROU1NeVVOQW1nNmdJcldUNXgtTHJqeTA1M3VoSnpob2pRYWJVeWIwT0szR0VCZUpOaWRqeW5QeDVxQWJlUzMzQjFlTmpXb3Q2b1lKbWpZOVkwTEpndlVUd2FfdjJ3TEFqVl83SkFrY1hkOVZoSjLSAa4BQVVfeXFMT3VQX1JidDJrOFFnOUZ1NE1WanBsZWZQa2ZYM0xqSWtTck83TDJ1VUNpYnFsc1B6WDdwYTMtY2J5amNGdFpiamNoMkRvMFd3NzRwbHFSeEc4WUFyaFItakJTMklqZzRNcF9ZUV9NVVRuWElYOGJXZGpFYnpkLThnOGp6bEU3c2ZjT1JCN2xMS2JUblBPR0J5TXczMW40X2ZUSk1DTDZoOVdhUlhETFFn</guid></item><item><title>前陆军游侠从肥胖的轮椅变成健身竞争对手：了解他的秘密- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQZ0dyLVJUNElZU0RmY0VQYkhLNFk3aWQ3UjNwY2xLclBJelk4ck51TjUydm80a01WRFF0c3dFRVMtNmhucm9kQ2g3M04zN1NzT0hqOXdSN0dGdkZFMFNtc2JjV0xxeG5FSF9hVkljRkRpNlo1eUx4MzBuZzE4Q3VjcUEwVFZoNUhFWk4wTDN2UkwyMXUtMUF0VkJIUTd0dFk2QkpBb1JhS0h1UU8zT3RhVXZtcVpNNmROTjRTTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation was so astounding that his fellow gym goers accused him of taking steroids and his wife of getting plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His personal trainer even laughed when RJ told him the simple secret to weight loss and optimal health that he learned at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?utm_source=rangeraugust25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; That's when he and his wife, Tina, dropped their personal trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RJ Slade served this country as an elite Army Ranger. His life changed dramatically, however, after a combat injury in Iraq in 2005. He went from the extreme physical fitness required to be a Ranger to requiring epidural steroid spinal injections. By 2013 he was in a wheelchair and going through medical retirement from the Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A host of health problems followed including muscle atrophy, weight gain, fatigue and poor digestion. These ailments combined to compromise his healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Health Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the determination typical of a Ranger, he poured all he had into recovery. He worked out intensely and tried to watch everything he ate, meticulously counting macros. Despite all his efforts, his health was not improving and no matter what he did he couldn't lose his excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when he and Tina visited Dr. Whit Roberts at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?utm_source=rangeraugust25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;. They were pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of the program.There was no cutting calories, no counting calories, no counting macros, no cutting out whole categories of food. There was no gorging on meat or fat. There were no fads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they learned that there are only three steps to losing weight effectively:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Identify and address underlying health issues compromising weight loss efforts.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Literally millions of people struggle to lose weight or lose it just to regain it because their bodies are out of balance and unhealthy", Roberts says. Health Utah uses a combination of a thorough review of your health, specialized testing, and proprietary health analytics to identify potential roadblocks to weight loss. Health Utah then systematically addresses these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Identify foods that are particularly and uniquely healing for your body and those that are harmful.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the best weight loss programs miss this very important component. Thirty years of experience have proven to Roberts how critical this is. One example of this was his patient, Ashley. Although she ate clean and worked out every day for an hour at the gym, she couldn't lose an ounce. She also struggled with anxiety, depression and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their proprietary methods, the practitioners at Health Utah identified corn as inflammatory to her body and instructed her to eliminate it from her diet. The result was that the weight started dropping, the migraines, anxiety and depression all resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This might sound like an isolated example but virtually everyone develops sensitivities to foods during periods of stress in their lives," Roberts says. "It's just difficult to recognize it because these kinds of sensitivities don't always cause stomach pain but cause things like fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and stubborn weight. The other surprising thing is that normally health foods like broccoli or bananas can be the culprits. The point is, these must often be identified and either resolved or eliminated from the diet before effective weight loss can occur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Address brain patterns and chemical rewards that perpetuate obesity.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is hardwired to drive you to eat the most energy producing and easiest to digest foods. The food industry has capitalized on nature to create addictive foods that give you quick easy energy but sadly make you sick over time, Roberts explains. You are rewarded every time you give in to these foods with feel good chemicals lighting up your brain's reward centers. With your brain working against you, willpower is never enough. Health Utah provides skills, tools and therapies to help you retrain the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Health Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah's program was life changing for RJ and Tina. They both lost a lot of weight. Tina went from a size 10 to a size 2. RJ dropped down to 5.3% body fat. RJ is now finishing up a certification in sports and nutrition, he is consulting at Good Earth and is competing in fitness competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer for KSL.com readers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theirs is not a unique story.
