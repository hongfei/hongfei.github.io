    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yinging Ma, lead study author and doctoral student at The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'By just two months of age, we can already see patterns in feeding, sleep and play that may shape a child's growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This shows how important it is to screen early in infancy so we can support families to build healthy routines, prevent excessive weight gain and help every child get off to the best possible start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837959"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 143 mothers and their babies who were receiving care from Geiser Health System in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-557abf40-c6ea-11f0-9690-cb2f8ffbf0b4"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food assistance for women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mothers completed a 15-question survey about their infant's diet, sleep, playtime and appetite, as well as if caregivers fed their babies with breastmilk, formula or a combination of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the mothers was 26, and 70 percent were white. The majority (58 percent) of households made under $25,000 per year, which is below the poverty line for a three-person household in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At two months old, 73 percent of infants were exclusively formula-fed. Infant growth was measured once at two months and again at six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that out of 12 behavioral routines, nine that were done when infants were two months old were associated with higher BMI and weight-to-length ratios when the babies turned six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of feeding, these routines included using bottle sizes that were too big for the infant's developmental stage, feeding too often at night and mothers thinking their infants were hungry more often than they actually were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the sleeping category, the four routines that led to higher weight were going to bed after 8pm, waking up more than twice at night, being put to bed while already asleep instead of drowsy and sleeping in a room with a TV playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for playtime, babies with higher BMIs were more likely to have parents who used their phone or watched TV during playtime and those who had limited active play or tummy time, when an infant spends time on their stomach to strengthen their upper body muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overfeeding infants, along with sedentary habits and a lack of physical activity, causes them to pack on weight. Poor sleep has been shown to increase levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear if the infants in the study remained overweight later in life, research shows early infancy is a key window that determines obesity risk. The first six months of an infant's life determine metabolism, or how well the body is able to turn food into energy. Slower metabolism burns fewer calories, causing them to be stored as excess fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slow metabolism early in life can cause infants to have bigger appetites as they grow up and more fat mass, leading to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting three in four Americans, overweight or obesity are primary risk factors for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team hopes to expand their research and look at families with a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as the new study largely focused on low-income households.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennifer Savage Williams, senior study author and professor and director of The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'With the limited time available during pediatric and nutrition visits, it's essential to help providers focus on what matters most for each family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy isn’t something we usually associate with specific geographic regions, but new research suggests that’s an oversight—at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research finds that certain parts of the U.S. have much higher rates of epilepsy than others. Researchers examined the Medicare data of Americans over 65 from across the country. Older adults were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a new case of epilepsy if they lived in the southeastern U.S., they found. The findings suggest that this region might have unique risk factors that contribute to the neurological condition, such as hotter weather or larger health care disparities, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Modifiable social and environmental conditions at the local level may contribute to epilepsy incidence among older adults and could help guide targeted prevention efforts,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The epilepsy belt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy-and-seizures"&gt;disorder&lt;/a&gt; characterized by surges of unusual electrical activity in the brain, which then causes recurring seizures. There are many different causes and forms of epilepsy, but it’s known that certain groups of people are more likely to develop it, including older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that the prevalence of diagnosed epilepsy can differ between various regions of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00302-5/fulltext"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214035"&gt;the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., the scientists behind the new study say theirs is the first to map how often epilepsy affects older Americans at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are from the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. They analyzed Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019, focusing on epilepsy cases newly diagnosed in 2019. All told, there were about 20,000 cases diagnosed that year. And the incidence rate of epilepsy varied significantly between regions of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest rates were found in southeastern states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The researchers also identified various factors that seemed to be correlated with epilepsy in the states along this “epilepsy belt”—as the researchers have dubbed it. Rates of insufficient sleep were higher in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, for instance; southern states also had more days of extreme heat during the year (a heat index above 95 degrees); and states like Texas and Florida had higher uninsurance rates (younger people without insurance are less likely to see a doctor, which could then delay a timely diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of these factors are thought to clearly increase epilepsy risk, like poor sleep, others have received less attention as potential causes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study documenting such a strong association between extreme heat and incident epilepsy in older adults across the U.S., highlighting the importance of climate change in emergency preparedness, especially given the graying of the population,” said study researcher Siran Koroukian, professor in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/discovering-america-s-epilepsy-belt-first-of-its-kind-national-study-reveals-us-regions-with-high/"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notably, this same region of the U.S. is also known to have higher rates of stroke, which has led researchers to call it the “&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.024155"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;“. Since strokes are yet another major risk factor of epilepsy, that too is likely playing a part in causing new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Areas of improvement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that about 3 million American adults are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;living with epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. And while the condition isn’t currently curable in most cases, it can be effectively treated with medications, surgery, and managing potential triggers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their findings can help improve efforts on epilepsy prevention and mitigation through various public health interventions in the areas of the country where people’s risk is highest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These may include improving sleep health, enhancing heat resilience, and reducing transportation and insurance-related barriers to care,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Current treatments cannot cure the condition. Although antibody-based drugs targeting amyloid β (Aβ) have recently become available, their benefits remain modest. These therapies can also be expensive and may trigger immune-related side effects, underscoring the need for safer, low-cost options that are easier for patients to access.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt; reports that researchers from Kindai University and partner institutions found that oral arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a safe chemical chaperone, can markedly reduce Aβ aggregation and its toxic effects in animal models of AD. The team noted that although arginine is sold as a dietary supplement, the dose and schedule used in their experiments were designed for research and do not match commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was led by Graduate Student Kanako Fujii and Professor Yoshitaka Nagai from the Department of Neurology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, along with Associate Professor Toshihide Takeuchi from the Life Science Research Institute, Kindai University, Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory and Animal Tests Show Strong Anti-Amyloid Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that arginine slows the formation of Aβ42 aggregates in a concentration-dependent fashion. Building on this evidence, the researchers tested oral arginine in two widely used AD models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; model, expressing Aβ42 with the Arctic mutation (E22G)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An &lt;em&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;knock-in mouse model, carrying three familial AD mutations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both systems, arginine treatment led to a significant drop in Aβ buildup and reduced the harmful effects associated with Aβ exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress Aβ aggregation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;," explains Prof. Nagai. "What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Extend Beyond Amyloid Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse model, oral arginine lowered amyloid plaque formation and reduced insoluble Aβ42 levels in the brain. Mice receiving arginine also performed better in behavioral assessments and showed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes linked to neuroinflammation, a key contributor to AD progression. These results indicate that arginine's benefits may involve not only preventing aggregation but also providing broader neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," notes Prof. Nagai. "Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to clinical trials for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurposing Existing Compounds for Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the advantages of drug repositioning, a strategy that repurposes existing safe compounds for new therapeutic uses. Because arginine is already approved for clinical use in Japan and shows good brain permeability, it may bypass multiple early hurdles that often slow traditional drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that additional preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm whether these effects will translate to humans and to determine appropriate dosing strategies. Even so, the results present strong proof of concept that basic nutritional or pharmacological supplementation could reduce amyloid pathology and improve neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cost-Effective Approach With Global Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study deepens scientific understanding of how Aβ aggregation occurs and presents a practical approach that could be implemented at scale. Its findings point to a cost-effective, readily available strategy that may one day support people affected by AD across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To vape or not to vape?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's Tobacco Control Treaty and what they call "the tobacco epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kill up to half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mea culpa!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. "I'm excommunicated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. "There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit," he says, arguing that this approach doesn't "recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In many other areas of medicine, the idea of "harm reduction" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: "Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's an important point to note about this group. It's funded by the tobacco industry. That connection has cemented his self-described excommunication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Yach is not a lone voice. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The U.K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that "for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not," Cummings says. "Many of us are legitimate scientists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. "That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mass marketing harmful products"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the tobacco industry is "misappropriating" the medical term harm reduction and "mass marketing harmful products" while "cloaking" it in medical language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit," says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults," says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. "The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;/a&gt;"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone." The stakes, their position paper says, are high: "E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Bialous&lt;/a&gt;, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One concern that's surfaced has been &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exposure to metals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have pointed in both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's "not responsible" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"An unutterable scam"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is "actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam," he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a third of Americans who were vaccinated against COVID-19 say they had side effects from the shot, and nearly half suspect the vaccines killed many patients,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 68% of American Adults say they got a COVID-19 vaccination, and a majority (60%) of vaccinated adults report no side effects from the vaccine. However, 26% say they had minor side effects and 10% reported major side effects from the vaccine. Based on a U.S. adult population of 258 million, this would mean 63 million had at least some side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, including more than 17 million who experienced major side effects.

&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all American Adults (including those who didn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19), 46% believe it is likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths – down from 55% in &lt;a href="/public_content/lifestyle/covid_19/killer_shot_most_still_suspect_covid_19_vaccine_risk" target="_self"&gt;September 2024 &lt;/a&gt;– including 25% who say it’s Very Likely. Forty-four percent (44%) now don’t think a significant number of deaths have been caused by vaccine side effects, including 20% who believe it’s Not At All Likely. Another 12% are not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,292 American Adults was conducted on November 10-12, 2024 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See&lt;a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology" target="_blank"&gt; methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who didn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine are more likely to suspect it had deadly side effects. Seventy percent (70%) of those who weren’t vaccinated, compared to 36% of those who did get the shot, consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who were vaccinated, 85% of those who reported major side effects think it’s at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths. By comparison, 69% of those who reported no side effects from the vaccine consider it unlikely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly more men (72%) than women (66%) got vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and more men (12%) than women (8%) report experiencing major side effects from the shot. However, more women (49%) than men (43%) consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older voters are most likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and less likely to say they experienced side effects. Twenty-two percent (22%) of men under 40 say they experienced major side effects from the vaccine, compared to just seven percent (7%) of women 40 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-two percent (42%) of whites, 46% of blacks, 53% of Hispanics and 63% of other minorities believe it is at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths. Hispanics are most likely to have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, and also most likely to report having experienced major side effects from the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans with annual incomes between $30,000-$50,000 say it’s likelythat COVID-19 vaccines caused many deaths, compared to just 36% of those with annual incomes over $200,000 who say the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of living – particularly higher grocery prices – &lt;a href="/public_content/business/general_business/81_of_americans_now_concerned_about_inflation" target="_self"&gt;continues to worry most Americans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/19/australia-ultra-processed-foods-consumption-rate-upf-lancet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half the calories they consume each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The term was coined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366466/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; that sorts foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;those containing too much salt&lt;/a&gt; – researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they can be hard to spot.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some fitness enthusiasts take creatine and magnesium after a workout to boost muscle gains. Small studies suggest this supplement combination may improve speed, power, and strength-training performance.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine is a compound made from amino acids, and magnesium is a mineral that supports protein synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Along with training, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/creatine-11714895" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine can increase muscle strength and mass&lt;/a&gt;, and magnesium may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrition-and-supplements-for-muscle-recovery-8374467" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help with recovery and exercise performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2020 study of 16 trained soccer players found that a creatine–magnesium chelate improved sprint speed and power.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Another study from 2019 found that taking creatine with electrolytes, including magnesium, helps increase strength and power during certain exercises. You don’t need to take them together, though &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-electrolytes-11764438" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;electrolytes like magnesium&lt;/a&gt; may help the body use creatine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We know that creatine provides energy to the muscles during high-intensity exercise, and magnesium serves as a cofactor for energy utilization processes. But there is little data to show that this combination has significant effects across various populations," &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/staff-directory/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Alexis Nicole Brown, PharmD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical sports pharmacy specialist at USC Mann, told Verywell in an email.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to take a combination creatine and magnesium supplement, consider taking it in the morning or with your workout. Otherwise, you can drink creatine during your workout and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-for-sleep-7501514" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;take magnesium an hour before bed&lt;/a&gt; to help with sleep, said &lt;a href="https://floridagators.com/sports/football/roster/staff/rebecca-mergy/808" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rebecca Mergy, MS, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a football performance dietitian at the University of Florida.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The deeper and better you sleep, the more muscle mass and muscle recovery happens. In combination, creatine can help almost during the lift, when the muscles are ready to be in the hypertrophy phase, when they are ready to grow, and magnesium comes in at night to facilitate the recovery piece," Mergy said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people take a large loading dose of creatine to saturate their muscle stores before taking smaller daily doses.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-creatine-per-day-11727119" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;typical loading dose for creatine&lt;/a&gt; is 20 grams for 5 days with a maintenance of 3 to 5 grams after; however, the loading dose isn't always used. Magnesium varies a bit by age and gender, but 350 milligrams would be the upper limit," &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/orthopedics/sports-medicine/team/sports-dietitians/sarah-wick-rd-cssd-ld" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sarah Wick, RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, director of sports nutrition at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Jameson Crane Sports Medicine Institute, told Verywell in an email.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You could try to get creatine and magnesium from food sources first, but if you want to take supplements, remember that higher doses are not always better. Speak with a healthcare provider before starting any supplements since your age, diet, training type, training intensity, medications, and health status might change dosage recommendations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many people can take these without significant risks, don't expect overnight results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Both magnesium and creatine can take weeks to have beneficial effects because the body must reach certain levels, which takes time, to have an increased effect on health and physical activity," &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/kari-l-franson-pharmd-phd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kari Franson, PharmD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, professor of clinical pharmacy and director of the sports pharmacy program at USC Mann, told Verywell in an email.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may experience uncomfortable gastrointestinal side effects when taking creatine and magnesium, such as nausea and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-do-if-creatine-makes-you-bloated-11812779" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "These can be mitigated by taking the supplements with a meal or snack, as well as decreasing the dose if gastrointestinal symptoms are bothersome even after taking with food," Franson said.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. continues to face its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worst&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fifth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/MEAS-AER-2024-Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;23 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Schwalbe calls those figures a "wake-up call."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;takes a toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v17060755" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to come in waves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing trend&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An authoritarian past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization," says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. "It's multifactorial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunizations were &lt;a href="https://romania.europalibera.org/a/doctor-mihai-craiu-fake-news-medicina-vaccinare-stiinta-dezinformare/33569279.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;given&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. "Virtually all children were immunized," he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority," historian Dora Vargha &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.7765/9781526110916.00010/html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a book about vaccines. "If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;introduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the magic number for measles. "If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/1999/11/05/1066228/the-collapse-of-communism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians &lt;a href="https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/articles/symposium2010/participant-papers/Simona_Vasilache_-_Romania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules," Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children," &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;read&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12013266" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cause&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as &lt;a href="https://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/view/195/191" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;headlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily, &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/wuenic-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-rezultatelor-estimarii-acoperirii-vaccinale-cu-2-doze-rro-la-5-ani-si-cu-1-doza-dtpa-la-14-ani_februarie-2024/?wpdmdl=127363&amp;amp;refresh=68f9bc5de5a3c1761197149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the share of those protected against measles decreased, &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=ROU&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pummeled the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't," says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. "Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A health system struggles to keep up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/21/romanias-health-care-system-the-eus-worst-struggles-to-reform" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fragile health system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that remains one of the most &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Healthcare_expenditure_statistics_-_overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underfunded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, a &lt;a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-025-00985-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shrinking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11598722/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;absence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of mandatory immunization policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lack of funding for health care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-08-2025-new-study-exposes-barriers-to-childhood-vaccination-in-romanian-communities" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disproportionately affects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; minority groups like the country's &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-eu/roma-equality-inclusion-and-participation-eu-country/romania_en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines," says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the years passed, the clergy &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-carry-tiny-knives-cut-veins-inside-romanias-toxic-anti/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20133-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/romania-president-election-simion-trump.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advocating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2022.2080669" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; church services during the early years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, far-right politicians &lt;a href="https://cepa.org/article/romanias-elections-a-victory-for-medical-populism/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;capitalized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, "God is not vaccinated" during a &lt;a href="https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/politics/romanian-mep-sosoaca-anti-vaccine-circus-in-the-european-parliament-until-her-microphone-was-cut-off-god-is-not-vaccinated-in-romania-88-are-not-vaccinated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brief speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the floor of the European Parliament last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A free fall in immunization coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-vaccination-coverage?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;ANTIGEN=MCV2&amp;amp;YEAR=&amp;amp;CODE=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lowest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.1787" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=170&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;administered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first at 12 months and then again at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small," the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. "Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recorded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf167" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mirrored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: "I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life," Schwalbe explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different way to talk to parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. "It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now," Craiu explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When speaking with parents, Dumitra &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s500640" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uses motivational interviewing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065483" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'" Dumitra recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. "After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from Romania's outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lost&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission, &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1,723 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its "own bubble" and often looks away from examples like Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'" Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This message &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;aligns with Health Secretary Robert F.

                The CDC has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; CDC scientists say they didn't change their website&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Department of Health and Human Services wouldn't divulge who ordered the adjustment to the wording, NPR's Pien Huang tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;no new scientific evidence to support the claim&lt;/a&gt; of a link between vaccines and autism. Huang notes that it is interesting that a headline on the CDC's webpage still states that vaccines don't cause autism. However, there is an asterisk next to this statement, which explains that the agency will not remove it due to an agreement with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who provided a key confirmation vote for Kennedy to become the HHS secretary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's chief negotiator has presented a new 28-point plan for peace to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.&lt;/strong&gt; International observers are encouraged that Trump has not given up on peace between Ukraine and Russia, but the proposal requires major territorial concessions from Ukraine, which the country has repeatedly rejected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration continues to suggest these concessions because the president is focused on getting a yes to his plan&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Russian analyst Sam Charap notes that for Trump, the details don't matter as much. He simply wants the fighting to come to an end, unlike the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, who are &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;more focused on the details&lt;/a&gt;. Russia desires more strategic territory, while Ukraine has been adamant on security guarantees from Washington and its Western allies to ensure this type of invasion doesn't happen again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House's Oval Office today. &lt;/strong&gt;This will mark the first time the two will meet face-to-face. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, emerged as a national figure after his primary win earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5615169/trump-mamdani-oval-office-communist-socialist" target="_blank"&gt;president has called Mamdani a "communist"&lt;/a&gt; on social media and repeatedly sought to paint him as too radical for the city that elected him mayor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The meeting is a reminder of the shift Mamdani has to make as he steps into the new role&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Elena Moore. The mayor-elect has a background as an activist, but today will be a &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;test for him in balancing his policy priorities&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining political diplomacy. As a reminder, Moore says, the president vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won the election, so the meeting comes with real stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of the Trump administration's interference&lt;/strong&gt; in the midterm elections, which are less than a year away. The president has consistently spread false claims about voting in the U.S. In the spring, he issued an executive order aimed at imposing significant changes to election systems. Although courts have largely blocked the order, he has hinted at the possibility of taking other executive action as well. The election community is concerned that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5599934/2026-trump-midterm-election-ballots-voting-national-guard" target="_blank"&gt;few things voting officials are watching for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-97821" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Communities are already experiencing more severe storms, flooding, and heatwaves. Scientists warn that when the planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees, there could be massive, self-reinforcing changes that could have devastating impacts worldwide. These changes are sometimes referred to as climate tipping points. They can unfold over decades or centuries and may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for life on Earth. Here are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5593087/climate-tipping-points-cop30-brazil-coral-glaciers-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;most important and well-studied changes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Coral reefs have been dying around the globe. They are very sensitive to heat, and their loss would destabilize many countries. Numerous people rely on them for food, income and livelihoods. Marine life that can only be found on these reefs would be at risk of extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could melt and result in the rise of sea levels around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Permanently frozen ground in the Arctic is thawing, which can cause the land to sink, resulting in cracks in the foundations of buildings, buckling of roads and the kinking of pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay up-to-date with the latest news&lt;/strong&gt; from the COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil, with this &lt;a href="https://app.npr.org/curatedplaylist/changingplanet" target="_blank"&gt;app-exclusive playlist of stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite having &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/decades-neglecting-an-ancient-disease-has-triggered-a-health-emergency-around-the-world-121282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;plagued humans for millennia&lt;/a&gt;, typhoid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt; is rarely considered a threat in developed countries today. But this ancient killer is still very much &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42353-9"&gt;a danger in our modern world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext"&gt;Research published in 2022&lt;/a&gt; revealed the bacterium that causes typhoid fever is evolving extensive drug resistance, and is rapidly replacing strains that aren't resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, antibiotics are the only way to effectively treat typhoid, which is caused by the bacterium &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; serovar Typhi (S Typhi). Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, scientists from multiple countries sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strains have been exported to Southeast Asia, as well as East and Southern Africa, but typhoid superbugs have also been found in the UK, the US, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The speed at which highly resistant strains of S Typhi have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern, and highlights the need to urgently expand prevention measures, particularly in countries at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-bacteria-that-cause-typhoid-fever-are-getting-better-at-evading-antibiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University infectious disease researcher Jason Andrews when the results were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning about drug-resistant typhoid for years now. In 2016, the first XDR typhoid strain was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/27-december-2018-typhoid-pakistan-en"&gt;identified in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic"&gt;quinolones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"&gt;cephalosporins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"&gt;macrolides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"&gt;azithromycin&lt;/a&gt;. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/typhoid-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=Global&amp;amp;YEAR="&gt;in 2024, there were over 13 million cases of typhoid reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00055-X/fulltext"&gt;with typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;health crisis&lt;/a&gt; on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182576" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/map_4.20.1-642x361.jpg" alt="A world map highlighting regions where the typhoid vaccine is recommended.

It was the first nation in the world to offer routine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/typhoid.html"&gt;immunization for typhoid&lt;/a&gt;. A small number of countries have now followed suit or are "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127848"&gt;planning or considering introduction&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has prequalified four typhoid conjugate vaccines as of April 2025, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127848"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, which states "these vaccines are being introduced into childhood immunization programs in typhoid-endemic countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is one of &lt;a href="the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the world's leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the lives of more people than  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-a-staggering-154-million-lives-in-the-last-50-years"&gt;Where available, vaccines are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00210-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some of the best tools&lt;/a&gt; we have to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/emergency-vaccines-reduce-disease-outbreak-deaths-by-almost-60"&gt;prevent future catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wb0xh000x26nm38yu3ng4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300063b6qbumk9n7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300073b6q4r090ism@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300083b6qydul6auy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=26/data-item-view/item-number=225/" target="_blank"&gt;will categorize cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300093b6q21z4bafd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Registries &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=25/data-item-view/item-number=220/" target="_blank"&gt;currently specify&lt;/a&gt; whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000a3b6q17se4l2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            President Donald Trump in January issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000b3b6qobgcy9bm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000c3b6qeiv5yga2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000e3b6q5utc54kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000i3b6qndymsihv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/national-program-cancer-registries/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;97% of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt;. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly half&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. population.

            The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000k3b6q5qoca1f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376186/" target="_blank"&gt;rising rates of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; among people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5123715/" target="_blank"&gt;younger than 50&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, U.S. guidelines &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/colorectal_cancer" target="_blank"&gt;now recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559177/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas &lt;a href="https://cprit.texas.gov/news-events/articles/cprit-launches-new-liver-cancer-initiative-to-address-growing-texas-public-health-concern/" target="_blank"&gt;initiated a statewide effort&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000n3b6qv1j6fbzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000o3b6qgp5pclwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000p3b6qg7v1cjob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000q3b6qwx1hberc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000s3b6qs3byy5dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000t3b6qqdbrtu5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of CDC data&lt;/a&gt; by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000u3b6q8uj1q6ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000v3b6qe7osu334@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000w3b6q9dgunwe6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038608/" target="_blank"&gt;two to three times&lt;/a&gt; as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000x3b6qx36zw7jo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674526/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2800989" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000y3b6qfw1a8iuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000z3b6qaxwpnekt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300103b6q4xco0rl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300113b6qgw6o8ij7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/988-suicide-crisis-lifeline-hotline-lgbtq-press-3-option-ended-states-backfill/" target="_blank"&gt;stopping specialized services&lt;/a&gt; for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s show up in emergency rooms every day with sudden weakness, trouble speaking, or vision loss. In many stroke cases, a blood clot blocks an artery that feeds the brain. Without fresh, oxygen‑rich blood, brain cells die fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors call these events early‑onset ischemic strokes when they happen between ages 18 and 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re less common than strokes in older adults, but they hit people who may be in school, working, or raising families. Many want to know why it happened and whether genes play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMSOM&lt;/a&gt;) did a meta-analysis, searching the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-human-genome-map-could-transform-medicine/"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt; for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people with early strokes is rising,” said study co-principal investigator Steven J. Kittner, MD, MPH, Professor of Neurology at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These people are more likely to die from the life-threatening event, and survivors potentially face decades with disability. Despite this, there is little research on the causes of early strokes,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittner and his team combined 48 studies and compared about 16,730 adults who had an early‑onset &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/work-stress-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-in-young-women/"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 600,000 adults who had not had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used a genome‑wide association study (&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome-Wide-Association-Studies-GWAS"&gt;GWAS&lt;/a&gt;), which scans millions of common DNA differences and asks whether any show up more often in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each small DNA change offers a tiny clue. Most of these common variants don’t act alone. Many nudge risk up or down by a little bit. Add those nudges across very large groups, and patterns start to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-genome-scan-found"&gt;What the genome scan found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One region stood out: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_(gene)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABO gene&lt;/a&gt;, which helps determine blood type A, B, AB, or O. The strongest signals in the scan clustered in this region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific genetic markers there pushed risk in opposite directions, a pattern that fits known biology of clot formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opposite push matters. It signals that some versions of the ABO region raise the chance a clot will form and travel toward the brain, while others lower it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABO gene does more than set letters on red blood cells. It also helps set levels of clotting‑related proteins, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Willebrand factor&lt;/a&gt; and factor VIII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with non‑O blood types tend to have higher levels of these proteins, and the A1 subgroup usually sits near the high end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII can make clots more likely. That connection explains why ABO biology shows up in a study of early stroke, which often begins with a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shared-genetic-signals"&gt;Shared genetic signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested whether the same DNA signals in ABO influence several traits at once. They compared the markers tied to early‑onset stroke with markers tied to von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, and venous thromboembolism (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/venous-thromboembolism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VTE&lt;/a&gt;), a condition where clots form in veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found strong evidence that the same underlying genetic signals in the ABO region affect all these traits, and statistical tests supported shared causes rather than random overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VTE often appears as a deep‑vein clot in a leg or as a clot that breaks off and travels to the lungs. Doctors already link higher von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels to a greater chance of venous clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic overlap connects these clinical observations to specific differences in ABO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our meta-analysis looked at people’s genetic profiles and found associations between blood type and risk of early-onset stroke,” explained study co-principal investigator Braxton D. Mitchell, PhD, MPH, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association of blood type with later-onset stroke was much weaker than what we found with early stroke.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Real-world blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic markers tell one part of the story; actual blood types tell another. People with early‑onset ischemic stroke were more likely to have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-this-blood-group-age-more-slowly-according-to-new-research/"&gt;blood group&lt;/a&gt; A and less likely to have blood group O than comparison groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The B subgroup did not show a strong association with early stroke in this study, unlike patterns sometimes seen with venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real‑world blood group patterns line up with the DNA signals near ABO. They point to blood‑type biology as a key piece of early stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know why blood type A would confer a higher risk, but it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots,” said Dr. Kittner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fine-grained-clues-inside-abo"&gt;Fine‑grained clues inside ABO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic marker tagged the O1 blood subgroup and was linked to about a 12 percent reduction in the odds of early stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another marker tagged the A1 subgroup and was tied to about a 16 percent increase. The story is not as simple as “any non‑O type is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opposite directions help explain why some people with certain ABO subgroups face higher risk while others see some protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with its large numbers, the project has limits. It is one of the biggest genetic studies of early‑onset ischemic stroke so far, but it was still smaller than some studies in other diseases, so very small genetic effects may have gone undetected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants had European ancestry, even though the study included people from other backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because genetic variants can differ in frequency and effect across populations, larger and more diverse studies will sharpen the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-stroke-and-future-health"&gt;Blood type, stroke, and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk does not arise from DNA alone. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, infections, hormones such as those in some oral contraceptives, and everyday habits involving sleep, diet, and exercise all play roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point toward clotting‑related genetics having a stronger influence on strokes that happen earlier in adult life than on strokes that occur at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work can test prevention strategies that mix lifestyle information, medical history, and genetics for people who might benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important and surprising research finding adds to our current knowledge about non-modifiable risk factors for stroke – including a person’s blood type,” said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at &lt;a href="https://www.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study also highlights the need for future research to sort out the connection of blood group with clotting risk in more diverse populations. This will help us to better understand the strength of this association across different races and ethnicities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:56:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZDFEV2FRNjhuSUtzUGN4dG85dFljdC1iTVQzOHNONHZocTlESWFnclF0MklEOXVKZnd4UmJXdjlMYl9yMm4xZXN2LUZTOGRKc2czaElIcjlHamwweURWWWdPcVRTUTRlMUNrbWRyTXJycTNHVDVFYzR1eVhaM3R6RHY0UFZtd08tcmtSb0JIWHZzeVpUdWpYR1ZYb05QRjcxcmc</guid></item><item><title>新药在临床试验中将“坏”胆固醇降低58% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A powerful new treatment has emerged in efforts to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-cholesterol-diets-speed-up-cancer-tumour-growth-100-times"&gt;high cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and the associated risk of heart health problems. In a new trial, the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlicitide_decanoate"&gt;enlicitide decanoate&lt;/a&gt; was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol by almost 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team tested the drug in a randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving people with an inherited condition that causes dangerously high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) – the 'bad' type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heterozygous &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22067-familial-hypercholesterolemia"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia&lt;/a&gt; (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is characterized by elevated levels of LDL-C from birth," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;Drugs That Lower Cholesterol May Also Reduce Dementia Risk, Says Huge New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 293 participants with HeFH, who were already taking cholesterol-lowering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; that weren't having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A once-daily enlicitide decanoate pill was shown to reduce LDL-C by an average of 58.2 percent after 24 weeks. Those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;given a placebo&lt;/a&gt; instead actually saw a slight rise in the levels of LDL-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In adults with HeFH, enlicitide is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for lowering the level of LDL-C," the study authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More positive results: side effects were limited and similar between the treatment and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; groups, and the benefits of the experimental drug remained consistent over the 52-week trial. Key cholesterol biomarkers associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-factor-in-walking-improves-your-heart-health-more-than-your-step-count"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in the treatment group too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg" alt="Cholesterol chart" class="wp-image-182563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;LDL cholesterol was significantly reduced in those who took the treatment.

The treatment is basically making sure the liver can do its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;cholesterol-clearing job&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already PCSK9 inhibitors available, but they're administered via injection. Patients are more likely to stick to courses of drugs given in pill form, and here, 98 percent of the trial participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adherence with both the once-daily oral intervention and fasting instructions for dosing was notably high in both treatment groups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High LDL-C is a problem for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.891929"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, not just those with HeFH. The main negative consequence is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, restricting blood flow and limiting how much blood reaches the heart and brain. Heart attacks and strokes become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, next the researchers want to see if this reduction in LDL-C has any meaningful impact on the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and test the drug more broadly. However, at least for this subgroup of people, we may now have a way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;lowering LDL-C&lt;/a&gt; back to regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;Eating Eggs Can Actually Lower Bad Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to get regulatory approval before it can be prescribed, but a phase 3 trial like this one is a key step – and the results are very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without timely intervention to reduce plasma LDL-C levels," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt;, "individuals with HeFH face an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to cumulative lifetime exposure to elevated LDL-C levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Next-generation vaccines could make the flu season less of a snot-filled nightmare—if they ever reach the public, that is. Trial data out this week shows that Pfizer’s mRNA-based flu vaccine performed markedly better than a traditional shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of a Phase III trial on the vaccine, funded by Pfizer, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The experimental vaccine was significantly more effective at preventing flu than a standard vaccine, the researchers found. The vaccine appears to cause slightly more side effects than others, but there’s a bigger concern: It’s uncertain whether it will be approved in the U.S., given the government’s current skepticism and fearmongering around mRNA vaccine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Better but with a catch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved more than 18,000 healthy adult volunteers in the U.S., South Africa, and the Philippines. It took place over the course of the 2022 to 2023 flu season. People were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the experimental vaccine, dubbed modRNA, or Fluzone, a widely used inactivated flu vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur. Both vaccines covered the four most common types of flu predicted to be circulating that season: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There were noticeably fewer confirmed cases of influenza in the modRNA group compared to the control vaccine group (57 vs 87), the study showed. Overall, the modRNA vaccine was 34.5% more effective at preventing flu-like illness. The experimental vaccine also appeared to generate a higher antibody response to the influenza A strains and a similar response to the influenza B strains (nearly every confirmed flu case in the study was caused by influenza A).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This randomized trial showed that the modRNA vaccine provided both similar and improved prevention of a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That added protection may come with some tradeoffs, however. People given modRNA reported more local reactions (70.1% vs. 43.1%) after their shot, such as injection site pain. They were also more likely to report systematic adverse events in general, such as fever (5.6% vs 1.7%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This finding makes sense, since a vaccine’s adverse events are often linked to the immune response it generates. So a stronger immune response tends to cause more side effects. But while adverse events were more common in those who took modRNA, these events were still usually mild or moderate in severity. In the end, the study researchers concluded that the adverse event profiles of the two vaccines were similar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The RFK Jr. wrinkle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, the most serious hurdle to modRNA’s approval isn’t its potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his allies have systemically &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-buddies-are-back-to-undermine-vaccines-2000687069"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines during the second Trump administration. Just this week, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;changed &lt;/a&gt;its website to boost the debunked myth that they cause autism. But as much as Kennedy and his buddies may mistrust vaccines in general, they have an especially strong hatred for mRNA vaccines, the newest type of vaccine that first saw wide use during the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;(wrongly) stated&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna were the “deadliest” vaccines ever created, for instance. Anti-vaccination advocates have also falsely claimed that mRNA vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/parents-pack/parents-pack-newsletter/feature-article-are-mrna-vaccines-type-gene-therapy"&gt;gene therapies&lt;/a&gt;, that they &lt;a href="https://www.sierracounty.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=95"&gt;make people magnetic&lt;/a&gt;, and that they’re causing an explosion in cases of &lt;a href="https://globalvaccinedatanetwork.org/news/turbo_cancer_and_mrna_myth_that_defies_biology_and_physics"&gt;“turbo cancer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These unsupported fears of mRNA vaccines have had real-world consequences. In May, Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; the approval application for its combination flu/covid-19 vaccine (which also seemed to show &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;greater protection against flu&lt;/a&gt;) after the FDA asked for more data. In August, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-yanks-500-million-from-critical-mrna-vaccine-research-2000639478"&gt;also pulled&lt;/a&gt; $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Contrary to claims from the anti-vaccination movement that mRNA vaccines are worse or more dangerous than other vaccines, this technology could actually strengthen our defenses against seasonal flu, and not just in terms of improved effectiveness. Since these vaccines typically take less time to tweak and produce than older types of vaccines, countries could wait longer to select the strains predicted to circulate during the season. That shortened lag could then prevent unexpected strains from causing a mismatch with the vaccine (a disastrous situation that’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;now happening&lt;/a&gt; this winter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna has said that it will seek approval for its stand-alone flu shot next year. And given these latest results, Pfizer will undoubtedly apply for approval of its modRNA vaccine, too. Typically, both vaccines would seem to have an excellent chance of approval. But nothing is typical these days.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have shed pounds with help from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"They lose weight, which is a positive thing," says &lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/warren-yacawych" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Warren Yacawych&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan, "but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The weight-loss products are called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center," Yacawych says. "It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's very challenging," Yacawych says, "to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A possible workaround came from a team led by &lt;a href="https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ernie Blevins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxytocin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not just nausea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem," says &lt;a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Derek Daniels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We had a happy accident in the lab," Daniels says. "And the happy accident involved a rat called the &lt;a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brattleboro rat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that "target good places but not bad places," Daniels says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Appetite and addiction&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for "rewarding food, like a burger," says &lt;a href="https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali D. Güler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the federal Indian Health Service posted dozens of flyers on Facebook promoting flu and COVID-19 vaccine clinics across the Navajo Nation, where the pandemic had inflicted a staggering toll just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notices, featuring photos of smiling families and elders in traditional clothing, tied immunization to tribal values like community responsibility and made a clear case for getting the shots. “Vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness or hospitalization,” one of them said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this year, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic, has put his stamp on federal immunization policy, IHS’ public messaging on vaccines has taken a stark turn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In internal emails obtained by ProPublica, IHS officials have flagged terms such as “immunizations” and “vaccines” for additional scrutiny, deeming them risky “buzzwords” that require approval from agency public information officers to be used in social media posts, pamphlets and presentations for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through mid-October, IHS had published far fewer posts on Facebook promoting vaccine clinics this year than last, ProPublica found. And in those posts as well as other notices, it replaced language touting immunization’s benefits with wording that frames both routine childhood vaccinations and annual flu and COVID-19 shots as a personal choice, advising patients to consult health care providers about their “options regarding vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current and former IHS clinicians told ProPublica the changes threaten vaccine uptake in Navajo communities and have left medical practitioners who serve this population feeling censored.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that they’re trying to put up barriers,” said Harry Brown, a physician and epidemiologist who left IHS in 2016 and now works for a tribally operated health facility in North Carolina. In a 26-year career with IHS, he said, he had never encountered an effort to stifle public health campaigns or restrict what medical providers said publicly about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from Brown, the health care providers who spoke with ProPublica didn’t want their names used, concerned it could endanger their jobs. One physician said the new IHS restrictions on vaccine-related speech factored into her decision to leave the agency this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t keep people safe,” she said in an interview just before she quit. “I don’t have any of the words anymore to say anything I need to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHS’ shift in vaccine messaging has not been previously reported but aligns with widely publicized changes within the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. In the past 10 months, as measles cases have hit their highest levels in decades, Kennedy has been tepid in endorsing the vaccine to prevent the disease while taking several steps critics predict will undermine public confidence in immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s launched a federal probe into scientifically debunked links between immunizations and autism and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in contracts and research grants for mRNA vaccines. This technology was central to the speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, he removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy, replacing them with his own appointments, including several vaccine skeptics. Kennedy has also endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;the founders of Idaho’s medical freedom movement&lt;/a&gt;, who helped persuade the state to ban vaccine mandates this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IHS, the only branch of HHS that operates its own network of hospitals and clinics, the altered federal landscape on vaccine policy has had a more direct effect on patient care, clinicians said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said the redrafting of IHS’ public messaging materials was designed to encourage “shared decision-making” between patients and their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Indian Health Service continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on vaccines and infectious-disease prevention,” the statement said. “Our focus remains ensuring Tribal communities have clear, trusted guidance and access to the care they choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement didn’t address questions about what prompted the revamped messaging or concerns raised by doctors about its potential effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Matthew Clark, the IHS’ deputy chief medical officer, insisted the agency’s approach to immunizations has remained consistent, even if its messaging about them has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We continue to advocate that every patient at every encounter be offered every FDA-approved and ACIP-recommended vaccine, when appropriate,” Clark’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear yet what effect the changes are having. Data hasn’t been released showing this season’s flu and COVID-19 vaccination rates for the Navajo Nation. Through September, the uptake rate for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, for 2-year-olds has held steady at around 95%, the level of herd immunity needed to prevent outbreaks, IHS data shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, IHS clinicians said, the agency’s lack of public messaging about vaccines was especially notable during the winter and spring, when a measles outbreak emerged in Texas and then neared the reservation’s borders in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak had spurred alarm. Tribal health facilities, which operate independently from IHS, flooded Facebook with information about MMR shots at the end of February and urged residents to get themselves and their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet two IHS doctors said that at about the same time, the agency installed its new restrictions on vaccine-related speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a March 13 email that Ryan Goldtooth, a public information officer at one Navajo Nation hospital, sent to colleagues, members of the group had been instructed to take down social media posts or flyers that contained the terms “vaccines (namely Measles)” and “immunizations” from the agency’s Facebook pages. “We cannot forward or post to the public,” the email said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email also said that the terms “immunizations” and “vaccines” had been reclassified “from low to medium-risk.” As a result, if clinicians used these words in public presentations and printed materials, they needed to be cleared by a public information officer first, Goldtooth wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email listed several other topics or types of information that could no longer be freely shared or talked about publicly. Starting from the date President Donald Trump returned to office, any information shared from a state health department, for instance, had to be removed from Facebook, the email said, without providing a reason. Any posts about executive orders also had to come down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldtooth, who still works for IHS, did not respond to requests for comment about the email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laura Hammitt, the director of infectious disease programs for the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has worked closely with IHS staffers on vaccination efforts. Limiting what they can say about vaccines could harm their ability to respond to future outbreaks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are really trying to be compliant with changes required by the administration but also have a responsibility to care for their patients,” Hammitt said. “Those two things can seem to be at odds.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest tribal jurisdiction with around 170,000 residents, has long been a focal point and challenge for IHS. The reservation is served by four of the agency’s 22 hospitals, but pockets within its 27,000 square miles of mountains and high desert have no cellphone service, internet access or electricity, creating hurdles for clinicians when it comes to communicating information and delivering care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These structural issues had a devastating effect at the start of the pandemic, when the reservation’s rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were among the highest in the country. The virus claimed the lives of at least &lt;a href="https://nec.navajo-nsn.gov/Data-Dashboard/COVID-19"&gt;2,300 Navajo citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the previous decade, vaccination rates among Navajos, especially for MMR and the flu, had regularly exceeded figures for the nation overall. They also exceeded rates for tribal communities in other regions served by IHS, which typically lagged behind the national average, according to the agency’s data. When the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in 2021, Native Americans’ uptake exceeded 60%, an effort bolstered by IHS public service messages and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Navajo Nation, IHS hospitals posted messages on their Facebook pages and circulated flyers that pushed community members to get the shots. “Protect yourself, protect your family, protect your elders,” the flyers said. Tribal members responded, arriving at clinics in droves, lining up in their vehicles to get vaccinated at hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who couldn’t travel to larger towns on the reservation that had health care facilities, teams working for IHS, the tribe and Johns Hopkins set up mobile clinics and made home visits to especially remote communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, IHS and tribal teams on the Navajo Nation sought to extend the COVID-19 shot success to routine vaccines. MMR immunization rates among 2-year-olds had dropped to 85%, but another coordinated effort restored communities on the reservation to prepandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IHS was the engine driving the campaign, said Hammitt, the Johns Hopkins doctor. Agency flyers and Facebook posts retooled appeals used to promote COVID-19 shots to endorse the MMR vaccine, adding a call to protect “future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of this year, however, the messaging began to morph again, with mentions of “measles” and “COVID” disappearing from IHS social media pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to flu season and the new school year typically usher in a robust vaccine campaign in IHS hospitals. But this year, doctors took note of how few notices went out, they said, as New Mexico continued to contend with the measles outbreak that began in Texas and the Navajo Nation encountered a late-summer surge in COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One exception came in May, when IHS officials shared a New Mexico Department of Health alert on Facebook saying measles had reached Sandoval County, which overlaps with the eastern flank of the Navajo reservation. Another came that same month, when the IHS hospital in the town of Gallup, New Mexico, announced a clinic for people who wanted to get vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IHS hospital in Shiprock, New Mexico, was the only facility to post a public service announcement about a back-to-school vaccine clinic for children. It included language telling patients to talk to doctors about their options and didn’t specifically mention measles, COVID-19 or any other infectious disease as such announcements had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another measles outbreak surfaced in the Southwest in mid-August, this time just to the west of the Navajo Nation along the Arizona-Utah border. In early November, it had grown to at least 200 confirmed cases, according to Arizona and Utah health officials. IHS didn’t issue any advisories or notices on Facebook about this outbreak. The new approval processes for greenlighting public health alerts slowed down local administrators’ and hospitals’ response, the clinicians who spoke to ProPublica noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several clinicians said the restrictions on vaccine-related speech alter the relationship between IHS doctors and patients, even if they apply only to public communications and not to one-on-one consultations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what we do for a living, and the most important thing we do is explain what’s going on to patients,” one of the doctors said. “If there is an external body interfering with that, as there is now, then that is shaping the fundamental trust between patients and the people trying to provide their care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ProPublica</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOV0YxbndzT1ZTZ0dQSXFXYW40dXUxU09tNXBzTkxaMHNrSHJLSURDanV5cm9CcUEyN1dibU5ZOGxGRlBrQXY3VkxVaXR6S1ZYZU0xbjVZbEI5anZGbGk4aFhQTGp1M0VqVkppbzFJU2N6SW5OWlFRRTROQkUzTXpsQQ</guid></item><item><title>您每天面对面做的7件事，科学表明它们比您意识到的更快地使您衰老- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/fashion-and-beauty/r-7-things-youre-doing-to-your-face-every-day-that-science-says-are-aging-you-faster-than-you-realize/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Your morning routine probably feels harmless enough. Splash some water, apply your products, get on with your day. But what if I told you that some of your most automatic daily habits are actually working against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years not really thinking about how I treated my face. I was too busy, too focused on other things, and honestly, I figured aging was just inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started noticing changes that seemed to happen faster than they should. Fine lines that appeared overnight. Skin that looked tired even when I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I started digging into the research. Turns out, science has quite a bit to say about the everyday things we do that speed up aging. And most of them are so ingrained in our routines that we don't even register them as choices anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Touching your face constantly throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you rested your chin in your hand today? Rubbed your eyes? Absentmindedly touched your cheek while thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of this habit during a particularly stressful period when I was working long hours. I'd catch myself in video calls with my hand on my face, over and over. Didn't think much of it until I read the &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a13196/why-you-shouldnt-touch-your-face/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on how our hands transfer bacteria, oils, and environmental pollutants directly onto our skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you touch your face, you're potentially introducing irritants that trigger inflammation. And inflammation is one of the primary drivers of premature aging. Your hands have been everywhere: keyboards, door handles, your phone. All that gets transferred straight to your pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this habit takes serious awareness because it's so automatic. I started by simply noticing when I did it, without judgment. That awareness alone cut down my face-touching by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days or when you're indoors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: when was the last time you wore sunscreen on a rainy day? Or while working from home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think sunscreen was only necessary for beach days or summer. The research tells a completely different story. UV rays penetrate clouds and windows. They're hitting your skin right now, even if you're inside reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/news/survey-shows-sun-protection-lacking-in-winter"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; reports that up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds. And UVA rays, the ones responsible for aging, pass right through glass. So that sunny spot by your window where you like to sit? Your skin is getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really got my attention was learning about cumulative UV damage. It's not the occasional sunburn that ages you fastest. It's the daily, unremarkable exposure that adds up over decades. Those few minutes walking to your car. The light coming through your windshield during your commute. It all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started treating sunscreen like brushing my teeth. Non-negotiable, every single day, regardless of weather or plans. The difference in my skin over just a few months was noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Using hot water to wash your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something satisfying about washing your face with hot water, especially after a long day. It feels cleansing, almost therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what that hot water is actually doing: stripping away your skin's natural protective oils. Your skin has a barrier function that keeps moisture in and irritants out. Hot water damages that barrier, leaving your skin vulnerable to dehydration and environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8778033/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hot water increases transepidermal water loss. Essentially, your skin can't hold onto moisture as effectively. And dehydrated skin shows every line, every wrinkle, every sign of aging more prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this shift when I started paying attention to how my skin felt after washing. Hot water left it tight and uncomfortable. Once I switched to lukewarm water, that tight feeling disappeared. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature is tepid, barely warm to the touch. It might not feel as satisfying initially, but your skin will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Sleeping on your side or stomach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me because I'd been a side sleeper my entire adult life. Turns out, the way you sleep matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press your face into a pillow night after night, you're creating creases and folds in your skin. These "sleep wrinkles" are temporary, but as we get older and our skin becomes less elastic, they &lt;a href="https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/05/sleep-wrinkles-are-real-here%E2%80%99s-how-they-leave-their%C2%A0mark"&gt;become permanent lines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing a deeper line on the left side of my face, exactly where my face met the pillow each night. That was my wake-up call. I've been slowly training myself to sleep on my back, which is harder than it sounds after decades of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even switching to a silk or satin pillowcase can help. These materials create less friction against your skin compared to cotton. It's a small change that adds up over thousands of nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Applying products by rubbing and tugging at your skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you apply your moisturizer? If you're rubbing it in vigorously or pulling at your skin, you might want to reconsider your technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think I needed to really work products into my skin for them to be effective. Rubbing in circles, pulling upward, putting in effort. The reality is that your facial skin is delicate, and all that tugging stretches it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: your skin has elasticity, but it's not infinite. Every time you pull and stretch, you're challenging that elasticity. Do it multiple times a day for years, and you're essentially training your skin to stay stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-apply-moisturizer-6824874#:~:text=Aim%20for%20about%20a%20quarter,to%20do%20this%20at%20night."&gt;Dermatologists&lt;/a&gt; recommend gentle patting or pressing motions instead. Let your products sink in through light pressure rather than friction. This approach is particularly important for the delicate skin around your eyes, which shows damage more quickly than anywhere else on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my entire skincare application routine to gentle pressing motions. It felt weird at first because I wasn't "doing" as much. But my skin responded well to the gentler treatment almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Skimping on sleep regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're busy, sleep is often the first thing to go. I went through years of functioning on five or six hours a night, thinking I could make it up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your skin repairs itself during sleep. That's not metaphorical, it's biological fact. During deep sleep, your body increases blood flow to your skin and rebuilds collagen. Miss out on sleep, and you miss out on this crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that poor sleepers showed increased signs of skin aging, including fine lines, uneven pigmentation, and reduced skin elasticity. They also recovered more slowly from environmental stressors like sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really struck me was learning that even one night of poor sleep affects your skin's barrier function. But chronic sleep deprivation? That creates a cascade of aging effects that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that on weeks when I prioritized seven to eight hours of sleep, my skin looked visibly different. Brighter, more even, less puffy. It was like getting a spa treatment just from sleeping properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Eating sugar and refined carbs throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This connection between diet and skin aging wasn't obvious to me until I started looking into the research on glycation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happens: when you eat sugar and refined carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in your bloodstream. Excess glucose molecules attach to proteins in your body, including collagen and elastin, through a process called glycation. This creates harmful molecules called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGEs literally make your skin less elastic and more prone to wrinkles and sagging. &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/news-and-articles/the-link-between-sugar-and-aging"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that glycation contributes significantly to skin aging and that dietary choices directly impact this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to snack on sugary foods throughout the day without thinking about it. A cookie here, some candy there, refined carbs at every meal. When I became vegan and started paying more attention to what I ate, I naturally cut back on processed sugars. The change in my skin was one of the first things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you can never have sugar. Just be aware that regular consumption of high-sugar foods is doing more than affecting your energy levels. It's affecting how your skin ages at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, aging is natural and inevitable. There's no magic routine that stops time completely. But understanding what accelerates the process gives you the power to make different choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about this list is how automatic these habits are. We're not consciously deciding to age our skin faster. We're just going through our days, doing what we've always done, not realizing the cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know better, you can do better. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit from this list and work on changing it. Once that feels natural, move to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked on all of these over the past few years, and I can honestly say my skin looks better now than it did five years ago. Not because of expensive products or treatments, but because I stopped doing the everyday things that were working against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your face is with you for life. Treating it with a little more awareness and care isn't vanity. It's just smart maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;World ‘closer to a future free of cervical cancer’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than 86 million girls in the most at-risk nations have received a vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) – the leading cause of cervical cancer – since 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s according to data published to coincide with the first World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day on Monday. Marking the commemorative date, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was “powerful momentum” globally to end the preventable disease, which kills around 350,000 women globally each year.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/cervical-cancer-vaccines-save-over-1-million-lives-lower-income-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data&lt;/a&gt; from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, revealed that 86 million girls had been vaccinated against HPV since 2023, protecting an estimated 1.4 million women from dying of cervical cancer in future. The WHO name-checked more than a dozen nations that launched HPV vaccination programmes this year, including Cuba, Pakistan and Rwanda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer,” said Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research shows the HPV vaccine to be highly effective. In 2024, a study revealed that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.positive.news/society/good-news-stories-from-week-4-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;no cases of cervical cancer had been detected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in young women in Scotland who received it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Doctors often emphasize that prioritizing your mental health is important.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to doctors, there is one particular aspect of your health that is often overlooked — and that's pelvic floor health for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials and doctors describe pelvic floor health as maintaining strong and flexible muscles that support your bladder, bowels, and uterus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common disorders concerning your pelvic floor include leaking urine, leaking stool, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clinic in Little Rock has been working to change that and encourages men and women in Central Arkansas to prioritize their pelvic floor health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Sally Oliphant is a doctor at Arkansas Urogynecology and Women’s Health who explained that pelvic floor disorders are often overlooked and under-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think urinary issues may be something women ignore, and think is normal after childbirth or with aging,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her clinic has been working to alleviate this burden for men and women by utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So we have a cystoscopy tower, and that's how we're able to look diagnostically in the bladder with a camera, and then do some of the treatments for urinary incontinence and inject the bladder with Botox, through a cystoscope. We can also inject the urethra with stress incontinence," she described.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic estimates nearly one in three women over the age of 20 may have a form of pelvic floor dysfunction. Though they suspect the number is much higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One habit that I think a lot of women get into is that we're always in a hurry, and you're emptying your bladder and you're pushing to get it done quickly. And that's really not a good bladder habit to try and push to get all that bladder out,” Dr. Oliphant said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she suggests taking your time, listening to your body, and recognizing when you need to check in with doctors.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's really important not to neglect the health of the vagina, the bladder, and the pelvic floor," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

And that risk could be even higher because of low uptake of the influenza vaccine so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Center for Infectious Disease Research &amp;amp; Policy (CIDRAP for short) at the University of Minnesota has been receiving reports that the dominant strain of flu this season in other parts of the world that get flu earlier — H3N2 subclade K — doesn’t match the new vaccine very well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pamela Gomez, respiratory disease epidemiologist in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said people should still be vaccinated against the flu. “As soon as possible is the best action,” she told Deseret News, as even a less-than-perfect match will help keep those who get the flu from hospitalization. It should still reduce the severity should one be sickened by influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gomez noted that it’s also impossible to say what will be circulating in the U.S. when flu season really kicks up in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So far, doctors in the U.S. say they’re mostly seeing H1N1, another influenza A that matches the vaccine. But what’s dominant could change, including the H3N2 subclade K, later as other factors like international travel and who’s exposed change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The holidays — and in fact, winter itself — are key times for influenza and other respiratory illnesses to be passed around for a number of reasons. People gather together more indoors, Gomez said. She said it’s not uncommon to see more cases of such illnesses right after Thanksgiving, Christmas or other winter holidays because people come together during those, from extended family meals to special programs to celebrate. Gatherings and travel — think sitting with hundreds of strangers on public transportation — all raise the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="When-should-you-be-vaccinated" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;When should you be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month would have been dandy, but it’s not too late. Gomez said the prime time to get the most immunity is September and October, but right away at this point is better than not at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This could be the second severe flu season in a row, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. Last winter ushered in more flu hospitalizations than the country has seen in close to 15 years. And at least 280 children died of flu, which is the highest number since public health started gathering the data in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-word-of-warning" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A word of warning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers in Canada are emphasizing the vaccine-virus mismatch to encourage the U.S. and its residents to pay attention to flu, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been less active on flu than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This is not the time to be flying blind into the respiratory virus season,” Dr. Danuta Skowronski, chief influenza and emerging respiratory pathogens epidemiologist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/a&gt; last week. The Canadian researchers published a &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the vaccine-virus mismatch in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Skowronski, one of the paper’s authors, said that Canada counts on what’s happening in the U.S. to help Canada prepare for its flu season, just as the U.S. pays attention to other parts of the world, especially the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is typically May to July and offers a peek at what might be coming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;What goes into each year’s flu vaccine is a best guess by experts who watch what is circulating elsewhere. North America takes note of what’s happening in South America, since that flu season plays out first. But subclade K showed up late in the season, so it did not influence the makeup of the flu vaccine preparation for this year. The early indications from the United Kingdom and Japan indicate it’s going to be a prominent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But it also is unlikely to be the only strain of flu going around. Vaccination remains helpful. In the UK, the current vaccine has been about 70%-75% effective in keeping children with flu from needing hospitalization. It’s been about 30%-40% effective in keeping adults out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;U.S. public health officials say it’s still a guess what will circulate and dominate here. And Skowronski called the subclade K “a drift, not a shift,” which is clearly better. The subtype, she told CIDRAP, has been circulating in humans since 1968, changing along the way to stay viable against immune system attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="When-vaccination-rates-lag" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;When vaccination rates lag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;IQVIA, a health information and research company, has reported that in the U.S., retail pharmacies have administered at least 2 million fewer flu vaccines than in the past. The pharmacy numbers matter because that’s where close to two-thirds of flu vaccines are taken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I’m not surprised,” Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center, told CNN. She said that vaccine skepticism promoted even by some leaders at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Australia, where vaccination has also fallen and subclade K is dominant, there have been more than 443,000 cases of flu, which is a national record, per the article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="U.S.-case-counts" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;U.S. case counts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that flu case counts are low, but climbing right now, up 2% for the week ending Nov. 8, which was the most recent report available. Most of the cases were influenza A(H3N2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Richard Webby, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; that H3N2 viruses “tend to be a little bit more problematic. When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC report said 1,665 people were admitted to hospitals with flu this week, but mortality data was not available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Tips-for-avoiding-flu" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Tips for avoiding flu&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Besides suggesting that people get vaccinated, Gomez offered some advice to help folks avoid the flu, regardless of which strain is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Basic hygiene is underrated but one of the best ways to stay safe,” she said. That means washing your hands regularly, especially if you are out and about and shaking hands or touching things other people commonly touch, like door knobs and handrails. Those items, at home and elsewhere, should be disinfected regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Anyone with symptoms of illness should stay home, and away from others as much as possible to help prevent spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Finally, she said to do healthy things like getting good sleep, eating nutritious food and exercising. Those all help one’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOMlN5M2lKOXdvSnh5R0M1NEh0NW9CRTctYndXVVZtTHA3MzdLc1h4aHpoTXlNems4ZGZVVm5qR1gzbUFSZWQ2Q295VE54VWoxQ2FhYWtYVUoxMUNEc0lCVF93eEJDcjA1Wkl0TVhaU2pWVldWSFdkRWZxNWVUUmo1RFNURTRjYjJkdTBtdkV3</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射：研究表明开始和停止的危险- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51407863/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

with her and searched for solutions that wouldn’t require her to put in additional effort in the kitchen (after all, she was already going to host the entire family), but it quickly blew up into what her husband called “ridiculous high school drama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, she asked the internet to weigh in on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;This woman got a text from her sister-in-law, asking her to make a separate Thanksgiving meal to accommodate her fertility diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="sil-special-diet-canceling-thanksgiving-1"

Harvard School of Public Health, which comprised nearly 18,000 women, discovered a higher incidence of ovulatory disorder in those who consumed more trans fats, sugar from carbohydrates, and animal proteins. On the other hand, those who consumed more iron, fiber, and protein from vegetables had a higher fertility diet score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “studies have shown that consuming a certain quantity of monounsaturated fats during the IVF cycle increased the success rate by three and a half times, as opposed to women who don’t eat good plant-based fats during that period,” &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/fertility/what-to-eat-to-get-pregnant/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alisa Vitti, integrative nutritionist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WomanCode: Perfect Your Cycle, Amplify Your Fertility, Supercharge Your Sex Drive, and Become a Power Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include avocados, nuts, and some oils (like olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things people who are trying to conceive should ignore, too. For example, if you’re having continued trouble, your doctor may suggest limiting dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re being exposed to dairy in mass quantities that’s more hormonally-driven, meaning the production of cow dairy has become very chemically manipulated,” Vitti explains. “These excess hormones may disrupt the conversation that the brain is trying to have with the endocrine system, particularly your ovaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be overwhelming for someone to devise a menu that’s suitable for everyone coming over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving, despite its &lt;a

			&lt;p&gt;A new chemical compound has shown promise for treating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182363" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. Its effects in a rat model of the disease were impressive, and the biochemists who discovered it are eager to progress to in-human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. And while it's still unclear whether these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert"&gt;plaques cause the disease's symptoms, or are merely a side-effect,&lt;/a&gt; they remain a major research focus for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that current treatment options for Alzheimer's extend only to symptom relief, the race is on to find drugs that may actually tackle the disease from its roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;Scientists Found 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new compound works by stripping excess copper out of the harmful beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About a decade ago, international studies began to point to the influence of copper ions as an aggregator of beta-amyloid plaques," &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Giselle Cerchiaro from Federal University of the ABC (UFABC) in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was discovered that genetic mutations and changes in enzymes that act in the transport of copper in cells could lead to the accumulation of the element in the brain, favoring the aggregation of these plaques. Thus, the regulation of copper homeostasis [balance] has become one of the focuses for the treatment of Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-182456" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-768x637.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-600x498.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new compound can strip beta-amyloid clumps of excess copper. (ACS Chemical Neuroscience)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper accumulation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00446"&gt;isn't always an issue for Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;: some actually experience a deficit of the essential metal in their brains. But for those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-deposits-of-copper-and-magnetic-iron-in-alzheimer-s-brains"&gt;who do have an excess&lt;/a&gt;, scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2362.2002.00933.x"&gt;have long suspected&lt;/a&gt; that returning the brain's copper levels to normal could help improve some symptoms, especially brain damage from oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested which compounds in a set of nine could best pull the copper from brain plaques. These compounds – eight &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine"&gt;imines&lt;/a&gt; (organic compounds containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond) and one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoline"&gt;quinoline&lt;/a&gt;-based – were first put through a virtual, 'in silico' experiment, which revealed two of the imines (which the researchers labelled as L09 and L10) and the quinoline-based compound (here dubbed L11) as suitable candidates for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer test suggested these three compounds should be able to pass the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-brain-barrier-guardian-shows-promise-against-alzheimers"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; (an essential hurdle for any in-brain therapy) and could potentially be given to patients as pills to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, mouse brain cells grown in a lab were exposed to each of the three candidate compounds for 24 hours, to test their toxicity. Compound L11 did the most damage to cells and showed signs of exacerbating oxidative stress: not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, L09 and L10 showed relatively low toxicity, while also protecting the cells' lipids and DNA from damage usually associated with the oxidative stress that accompanies beta-amyloid buildup.&lt;br&gt;

As well as restoring normal levels of copper in the hippocampus (the brain region best known for its role in short- and long-term memory), the compound also significantly reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The rats treated with this compound also performed much better in a maze activity designed to test their spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, compounds L09 and L11 had a much weaker impact in all measures.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cerchiaro and team are keen to move forward with clinical tests, which will give a clearer idea of how viable this treatment might be for human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;, of whom there are an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;55 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely simple, safe, and effective molecule," Cerchiaro &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "The compound we've developed is much less expensive than available drugs. Therefore, even if it only works for part of the population, since Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes, it'd represent a huge advance &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;over current options&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00291"&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;OREM, Utah — A Utah native and her 4-year-old son are facing the unimaginable: they were both diagnosed with cancer on the same day, just one hour apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney McRae, a mother of three, and her son Jamon learned of their diagnoses last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamon has a rare pediatric brain tumor called ependymoma, while Britney is battling gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, a cancer that developed after a molar pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My wife’s [cancer] actually has a pretty good cure rate,” husband and father Jake McRae said. “My son’s is not as good a cure rate, but we’re kind of hopeful that he falls into the good percentage range of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney and Jake McRae both grew up and met in Orem. Jake’s job as a medical doctor moved them to Medford, Oregon, most recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family lives six hours from the nearest children’s hospital. Jake travels between Stanford, California, and Portland, Oregon, for Jamon’s care. His other two children, a seven-year-old and a one-year-old, are being cared for by his grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamon, described as funny and cuddly, began suffering headaches before tests revealed the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The subtype he has is not the good one,” Jake said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Britney experienced a molar pregnancy around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was about eight weeks pregnant, went in to get an ultrasound, and when they did the first ultrasound, they’re like, ‘We don’t see anything that looks like a baby at all. It’s mostly like cysts,'” Jake said. “And her blood levels that check if you’re pregnant are kind of off the charts, which was concerning. And then she ended up going to get surgery to get everything out, like a D&amp;amp;C and it came back as a molar pregnancy. And then there’s a very small chance that the molar pregnancies will develop into what’s called GTN, which is like a cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two surgeries, Jamon is struggling with double vision and difficulty swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended family in Utah is heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unimaginable that both of them, within such a short period of time,” said Elaine Allred, Britney’s grandmother. “It was like I entered a world I didn’t recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister-in-law Chantal McRae said the family was all together back in September. They had no idea this was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like none of us really felt like it was real at first,” Chantal said. “We’ve all been really, really struggling with the emotions and being so far away from them and the inability to be there for them physically and support them through this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother-in-law Kyson Clegg said the family’s faith is helping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been difficult to reconcile the loving God that we believe in with this suffering of Jamon, but through it all, our faith is going to get us through it,” he said. “I believe in the kid. He’s a tough little kid. He’s a fighter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney’s sister, Amber Bateman said Britney and Jamon’s bond is special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With her treatments, it definitely pulls her away,” Bateman said. “So many times he’ll just be laying in bed and he’s like, ‘Mom, where are my cuddles? Where are my snuggles?’ And Jake will be like, ‘Can I snuggle?’ He’s like, ‘No. I need mom snuggles.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake said it’s hard to be on this side of illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jamon is kind of getting to the point where he’s sick of being poked and prodded and all the things that they do. And the first question he asks is, ‘Are they going to hurt me?’ As a dad, it’s so hard to see this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allred said Britney and Jake are staying strong for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Britney always has a smile on her face, even with the news,” Allred said. “I admire Jake for being able to hold it together. And, it’s a big responsibility. And it’s tough seeing people that you love go through such a terrible experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney’s brother launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/mother-son-fighting-cancer-help-britney-jamon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;*GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help with travel costs and missed work. The family hopes Jamon regains enough strength to enjoy a sweet treat by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just the biggest lover,” Chantal said. “He’s hilarious. He’s so funny … it’s really hard to see him going through this.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2024 study published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found how a single genetic change in an H5N1 virus was enough to shift the virus’s receptor binding preference from birds to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KSTYKTV6EVEARD3EEQATPOQ6TA"&gt;The current risk to the public is low because there has been no record of the virus spreading from one human to another, according to state and federal health agencies.

She became more rambunctious and active.

							&lt;p&gt;My neighbor Margaret is 67 and has skin that honestly looks better than some people I know in their forties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, her sister visits from across the country a few times a year, and despite being three years younger, looks noticeably older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same genetics, completely different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting curious about this, I started paying closer attention to what people with great skin actually do versus what they think they're supposed to do. Turns out, a lot of us are unknowingly aging ourselves faster by sticking with outdated habits that no longer serve us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still doing these things, it might be time to reconsider your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Using harsh, stripping cleansers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we were told to wash our faces until they felt "squeaky clean"? That tight, almost dry feeling after cleansing was supposed to mean your skin was actually clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that advice has aged about as well as some of those old skincare routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harsh cleansers strip away your skin's natural oils and damage the moisture barrier. After 60, your skin already produces less oil naturally, so stripping what little you have leaves your skin looking dull, dry, and yes, older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this mistake for years, using foaming cleansers that left my face feeling tight. Once I switched to gentler, creamy cleansers, the difference was noticeable within weeks. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your cleanser should remove makeup and dirt without leaving your skin feeling parched. If your face feels tight after washing, that's not clean. That's damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you looked outside, seen gray skies, and decided to skip the SPF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about UV rays. They don't take days off just because you can't see the sun. Up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds, meaning you're still getting sun damage even when it's overcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women I know with the best skin in their sixties and beyond wear sunscreen every single day, regardless of the weather or whether they're planning to go outside. It's as automatic as brushing their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun damage is cumulative. Every unprotected day adds up over the years, showing up as age spots, wrinkles, and uneven texture. You can use the most expensive serums and creams in the world, but if you're not protecting your skin from UV damage, you're basically taking one step forward and two steps back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make SPF 30 or higher part of your morning routine, rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Over-exfoliating to chase that "glow"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exfoliation can be wonderful for your skin. The keyword here is "can be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people over 60 are exfoliating daily, sometimes multiple times a day, because they've heard it gives you glowing skin. And while gentle exfoliation does help remove dead skin cells and brighten your complexion, overdoing it creates the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive exfoliation damages your skin barrier, increases sensitivity, and actually accelerates aging. Your skin becomes red, irritated, and more prone to wrinkles because you've stripped away the protective layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a phase in my late thirties where I was using a physical scrub in the morning and a chemical exfoliant at night. My skin looked inflamed and aged rather than glowing. When I scaled back to exfoliating just twice a week, everything calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we age, our skin becomes thinner and more delicate. It needs gentler treatment, not more aggressive scrubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Applying products to dry skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you apply your serums and moisturizers to completely dry skin? This is one of those habits that seems logical but actually works against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly damp skin absorbs products much better than dry skin. When your skin is damp, it acts like a sponge, pulling hydration and active ingredients deeper into the layers where they can actually do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better approach is to pat your skin mostly dry after cleansing, leaving it slightly damp, then immediately apply your serums and moisturizers. This locks in that extra moisture and helps your products work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's such a small change but makes a real difference in how hydrated and plump your skin looks. I started doing this a few years ago after reading about it, and I honestly can't believe I spent so many years doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your expensive skincare works better when you apply it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Using the same products year-round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin's needs change with the seasons, but many people use the exact same routine in humid summer and dry winter alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In winter, indoor heating and cold outdoor air create a much drier environment. Your skin needs richer, more occlusive moisturizers to prevent moisture loss. In summer, humidity is higher and your skin might need lighter formulations to avoid feeling greasy or clogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women with great skin adjust their routines seasonally. They might use a lighter gel cream in summer and switch to a heavier balm in winter. They add hydrating essences when the air is dry and scale back when it's humid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin is telling you what it needs if you pay attention. Tight and flaky in winter? Add more moisture. Breaking out in summer? Lighten up your products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One routine doesn't fit all seasons, especially as your skin becomes more sensitive with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Neglecting the neck and chest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick question: do you stop at your jawline when applying skincare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do, and that's exactly why their neck and chest often look older than their face. The skin on your neck is thinner and more delicate than facial skin, with fewer oil glands. It shows age quickly if you're not taking care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see women all the time with beautifully maintained facial skin and necks that tell a completely different story. It's such a missed opportunity because treating these areas takes literally seconds more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you put on your face should go on your neck and chest too. Cleanser, serums, moisturizer, and especially sunscreen. Apply with upward strokes rather than dragging the delicate skin downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Sleeping on cotton pillowcases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a minor detail, but the surface you sleep on for 7-8 hours every night actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton pillowcases absorb moisture from your skin and can create friction that leads to sleep lines and wrinkles over time. After 60, when your skin is already losing elasticity and moisture, those sleep lines don't bounce back as quickly as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk or satin pillowcases create less friction and don't absorb moisture from your skin and hair. They're gentler on aging skin and can help prevent those creases that eventually become permanent wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical about this until I tried it myself. The difference wasn't dramatic overnight, but after a few months, I noticed my skin looked less creased in the morning and felt more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something that costs less than a decent moisturizer and lasts for years, it's worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this list, you might notice a theme. Most of these habits come from outdated advice or from doing too much rather than too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin after 60 needs a gentler, more thoughtful approach than it did in your twenties or even your forties. It's not about having a ten-step routine with the most expensive products. It's about understanding what your skin actually needs and dropping the habits that work against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking one habit from this list to change. Maybe it's finally committing to daily sunscreen or switching to a gentler cleanser. Small, consistent changes add up to significant results over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin has carried you through decades of life. Treat it with the care and respect it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

In the UK, about &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/young-people-england-common-mental-health-conditions-nhs-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a quarter of older teenagers&lt;/a&gt; and up to a fifth of younger children have anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance says under-18s with moderate to severe depression &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng134" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can be prescribed antidepressants alongside therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Journal of Clinical Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects. It concludes that the potential risks of harmful side-effects of fluoxetine are likely to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common side-effects experienced by children on antidepressants are weight gain, sleep disturbance and concentration problems. They can also increase suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Children detained under Mental Health Act held for hours in A&amp;amp;E departments","elementId":"d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/12/children-mental-health-act-accident-emergency-departments-england-wales"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also examined clinical guidelines in the US and Canada and found that just as in the UK, they ignored evidence that Prozac was clinically equivalent to placebo and continued to recommend its use for children and adolescents with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mark Horowitz, an associate professor of psychiatry at Adelaide University and a co-author of the study, said: “Fluoxetine is clearly clinically equivalent to placebo in its benefits, but is associated with greater side effects and risks. It is difficult to see how anyone can justify exposing young people to a drug with known harms when it has no advantage over placebo in its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines should not recommend treatments that are equivalent to placebo. Many clinicians take the common-sense approach that we should seek to understand why the young person feels depressed and address the factors that are contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines in the UK and around the world currently recommend treatments for children with depression that are not in line with the best evidence. This exposes young people to the risks of medication without any benefit over placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The long-term effects of antidepressants in children and adolescents were “poorly understood” and research among adults showed risks included serious side effects that may be long-term and in some cases persist after stopping the medication, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, a Nice spokesperson said: “Mental health is a priority for Nice and we recognise that depression in young people is a serious condition that affects each differently, which is why having a range of treatment options is essential for clinicians. Our guideline recommends a choice of psychological therapies as first line treatment options for children and young people with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nice recommends that children and young people with moderate or severe depression are reviewed by specialist teams. Antidepressants may be considered in combination with psychological therapy for moderate to severe depression in some cases and only under regular specialist supervision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Allan Young, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Academic Faculty, said that the study should be interpreted with “caution”. “Clinical guidelines weigh many factors beyond average effect size, including safety, feasibility, and patient preferences. It is important that prescribed medication demonstrate consistent evidence and safety data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxNZUplWHI4MGliMml0MnlDQjhhSUFfeTFMV0Q4ZXJQaU80bndTcFFhNVBBRDByMjc0ckR2VXl0elhyWDFISl9CWGYwalZ6YnktUGJBajI2OVFRMVdJSUVPNThjUWNIY3Zwb3o5SjE2Uk9jMS1zME5uYUIwczVPR3BodzJNVWpMdHItQjJQcjROejZuZjQ2dngtQlJBcHU5QTEzMXZ1VkppU3hZNlpETXROLXJ0VkRwdk5qYlFjVGdEZTE2YnFwOVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家在发现可能导致帕金森病的被忽视因素后发出警告： “即使是低剂量暴露” -雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/scientists-issue-warning-discovering-overlooked-230000798.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-01145-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fresh research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fresh research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a link between nanoplastic ingestion and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-01145-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, a recent experiment involved mice who were fed small amounts of polystyrene for three months. After that time, the mice had damaged intestinal lining and higher liver inflammation.

Microplastics typically measure between 1 micrometer and 5 millimeters, but nanoplastics are as small as 1 nanometer. This small size makes nanoplastics especially insidious and able to infiltrate bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other research has corroborated the harmful effects of nanoplastics, including causing dementia, lung damage, and compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are nanoplastics important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research data suggested that vulnerable populations may be at added risk from nanoplastic threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The observed disruption to the gut-liver-brain axis suggests that even low-dose exposure may pose systemic risks," the report said. "Vulnerable populations, including individuals with neurological or metabolic conditions and children, may therefore face heightened impacts from nanoplastic exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about nanoplastics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; can reduce your environmental exposure to the particles that plastic sheds.

The change was posted Wednesday and first reported by&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/cdc-changes-webpage-to-say-vaccines-may-cause-autism-revising-prior-language-061e2dc2?mod=hp_lead_pos11" target="_blank"&gt; The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-194da8" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians and vaccine experts have long said that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;autism is among the most studied childhood conditions&lt;/a&gt; and that no credible research has ever suggested a link between it and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a474d" class="body-graf"&gt;The messaging is an about-face to the agency’s decades of research showing that any link between vaccines and autism has been scrutinized time and time again and thoroughly debunked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82096f" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists, vaccinologists and autism researchers who’ve sought to identify possible causes were gobsmacked by the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77f63d" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is madness,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, head of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious diseases committee, said during a media briefing Thursday. O’Leary said that scientists have taken an exhaustive look at potential environmental causes of autism. “One thing that is very clear is that vaccines are not one of those things. They do not cause autism. Period.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc0c14" class="body-graf"&gt;The Autism Science Foundation said in a statement that the group is “appalled” by the change in CDC messaging, calling it “anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies about vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c295" class="body-graf"&gt;“The idea that vaccines cause autism is not only scientifically false,” ASF director Alison Singer said during a media briefing, “it’s also profoundly stigmatizing to autistic people and to their families. It frames autism as being caused by parental action, as if autism is a preventable injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fd1bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the updated webpage also notes that the Department of Health and Human Services has launched “a comprehensive assessment” to examine the causes of autism. It’s unclear what the assessment will be or how it will be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5284d8" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the website had been updated “to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” A question about how the agency defines such science wasn’t immediately answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02d0af" class="body-graf"&gt;The new language comes just ahead of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Dec. 4-5, where members are expected to vote on changing the childhood schedule for hepatitis B vaccines. When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met in September, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;delayed changing the guidance &lt;/a&gt;that all newborns should be vaccinated against the incurable infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af0d74" class="body-graf"&gt;The Trump administration had previously demanded changes to the CDC website, notably insisting that anything related to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/federal-health-workers-terrified-dei-website-publishes-list-targets-rcna190711" target="_blank"&gt;diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, be erased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239d8" class="body-graf"&gt;This latest revision “crossed the line,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center and former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab51ee" class="body-graf"&gt;The administration has “hijacked the premiere public health industry to pursue a narrow agenda of spreading inaccurate information about vaccines,” Goodman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87cdcc" class="body-graf"&gt;The new CDC messaging wasn’t reflected across the agency’s website, however. A&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; page for parents&lt;/a&gt; states that “scientific studies and reviews continue to show no relationship between vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-752739" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the revision was the clearest signal yet that the CDC may no longer be a source for objective scientific findings and advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e0e68" class="body-graf"&gt;“In my deepest heart, this is the day CDC died,” said a former CDC official who asked not to be named for safety reasons. “The public won’t care about nuance and individual websites now. Any messaging trying to distinguish some from all will sound tone deaf.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-037d62" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes on the CDC page seemed to contradict a commitment Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfe59" class="body-graf"&gt;During the hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirmation-hearings-rfk-jr-kash-patel-tulsi-gabbard-takeaways-rcna189463" target="_blank"&gt;Cassidy told Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, “My concern is that if there is any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine-preventable disease.” After getting assurances from&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-sen-bill-cassidy-wavered-confirming-rfk-jr-says-lived-promises-vac-rcna206882" target="_blank"&gt; Kennedy not to undermine faith in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, Cassidy voted to confirm him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-10f8f6" class="body-graf"&gt;A key section on the page kept the heading, “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but with an asterisk added. Following that is a newly added asterisk noting the heading is there “due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd0cc" class="body-graf"&gt;One CDC staffer not permitted to speak to the media said they read the Cassidy reference as “a direct middle finger” to the senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-482081" class="body-graf"&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to a request for comment. He later &lt;a href="https://x.com/senbillcassidy/status/1991599014270365829?s=46&amp;amp;t=mDcaBB75OPLoWR-8UuXfbA" target="_blank"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af614" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has long been known as an anti-vaccine activist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282a02" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the update to the CDC webpage is a nod to anti-vaccine activists that Kennedy hasn’t forgotten them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-308ce0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He’s signaling to his tribe that he’s there and he’s doing their bidding,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bb51b3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the autism studies really show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-696a7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some scientists and doctors accused the CDC of cherry-picking studies that raise doubt about the relationship between autism and vaccines, and misrepresenting data or omitting credible studies that don’t show an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e204d0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re taking evidence of safety and pretending it shows uncertainty. And I think that’s in a lot of ways actually worse than citing bad studies, because it’s corrupting good ones,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43da5f" class="body-graf"&gt;For instance, the CDC webpage points to &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; from July, which found that aluminum exposure from vaccines during the first two years of life was not associated with increased rates of neurodevelopmental disorders. The study looked at more than 1.2 million children over roughly two decades and is considered one of the most robust pieces of evidence that vaccines and autism aren’t linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-392878" class="body-graf"&gt;“If aluminum in vaccines were causing autism or other chronic conditions, that study would have found it,” Scott said. “But ironically, they actually found slightly lower rates of autism with higher aluminum exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191a8f" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the CDC webpage highlights a supplementary figure in the study suggesting an increased risk of Asperger’s syndrome in a tiny subset of children. Scott described the result as a “statistical blip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d99c1" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you test 50 different conditions, you expect to see a couple of outliers just by pure chance. That’s just basic statistics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-add670" class="body-graf"&gt;The webpage also cites two reports from the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of Medicine) — from 1991 and 2012 — suggesting there wasn’t enough data to say whether the pertussis vaccine causes autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a3111" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those reports actually rejected links between vaccines and autism,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-274bb0" class="body-graf"&gt;Other studies cited on the CDC webpage that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines aren’t well conducted, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ba449" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189402/" target="_blank"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that aluminum in vaccines given to infants may be associated with a rise in autism cases. Scott said the study merely showed that two things happened at the same time — autism cases rose and the number of aluminum-containing vaccines given to children went up — not that they’re connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-782eec" class="body-graf"&gt;“The classic analogy is like saying ice cream sales cause drowning, because both increase in the summertime,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5a47b" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC webpage also points to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21058170/" target="_blank"&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that boys vaccinated for hepatitis B as newborns had a threefold higher risk of autism compared with boys who were vaccinated later or never vaccinated. The study was based on parent surveys rather than medical records.

In addition, the team exposed a different set of endothelial cells to radiation to induce senescence and then transplanted those cells into lean lab mice with normal metabolisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing senescent endothelial cells from the obese mice was associated with reduced fat mass, improved blood sugar levels and an overall reduction of metabolic dysfunction. Conversely, transplanting senescent cells into lean mice was associated with higher blood sugar levels and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When these cells go into this dormant state of senescence, they start producing inflammatory substances that are called Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)," Musi said. This mechanism helps explain why removing senescent cells was associated with an improved metabolic rate. Cells usually take nutrients from the bloodstream, such as fat and glucose, to create the energy they need to function properly. But when they encounter the onslaught of inflammatory molecules from SASP cells, that process gets derailed, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cellular metabolism gets altered, and that translates into abnormal tissue and then abnormal whole-body metabolism," Musi told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-d4a83e92-0cc2-414e-8d39-35260bbabfc5" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="senolytics-are-potential-treatments-3"&gt;'Senolytics' are potential treatments &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d8797d97-c396-4816-ae00-7034c575ef6d"&gt;In a second phase of the study, the researchers treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a drug that the team previously found could eliminate senescent cells. This type of drug is known as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;senolytic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In both groups, treatment with fisetin was associated with fewer senescent blood-vessel cells and improved glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested the drug on tissue samples from six adults with obesity who were in their 40s and 50s. They observed a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells in the treated tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c2f61185-8e21-4bff-beff-68d0395c8028"&gt;Aguayo-Mazzucato thinks this study could pave the way for new treatments targeting senescent cells in the cardiovascular system. "Metabolic dysfunction is a whole-body problem. You have nutrient utilization alterations in a lot of tissues," she said. Because senescent vascular cells are present throughout the entire body, targeting them in different organs could help doctors address a range of diseases, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than say we're going to treat cancer or we're going to treat diabetes, Alzheimer's [or] Parkinson's as defined entities, the idea is saying they're all age-related and there are pathways that are common to all age-related diseases," Aguayo-Mazzucato said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinical studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that investigate whether senescence has the same effects in human blood vessels that were observed in lab mice, Suda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="3798c96c-cc7b-4295-aea6-6225cf90dd27"&gt;

By studying male fruit flies, researchers found that dopamine acting through the D2 receptor promotes persistence during mating, but repeated experiences cause these receptors to desensitize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once desensitized, dopamine becomes less effective, and males abandon mating more easily when faced with distractions or threats. This reveals the first natural function of a mechanism long associated with addiction, suggesting a shared biological basis for boredom, fatigue, and declining interest in repeated activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Desensitization:&lt;/strong&gt; Repeated rewarding behaviors trigger D2 dopamine receptor desensitization, reducing motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Addiction Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The same receptor process behind drug tolerance also drives everyday loss of interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivational Fatigue:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings offer a biological explanation for why repeated thrills or activities become less engaging over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brain’s reward system processes and reinforces pleasurable experiences, motivating us to seek out and engage in rewarding activities ranging from eating to social interactions to recreational drug use. Dopamine plays an important role in this process, mediated by the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; finds that the same mechanism that causes drug addiction (desensitization of D2R) also controls the natural devaluation of repeated behaviors (e.g. seeking out the same thrill of going on a rollercoaster for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first natural use found for this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital used male fruit flies to study behavior fatigue. They found that during mating, dopamine signaled through the D2R to promote resilience in the face of threats that might otherwise cause the male to switch behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after multiple matings, the receptors became desensitized, making dopamine less effective and subsequent matings more likely to be abandoned when challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that this type of repetition-induced devaluation may underlie many types of commonly experienced mental and motivational fatigue (e.g., loss of interest),” said Michael Crickmore, PhD, from the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children’s Hospital and principal investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug addiction causes desensitization throughout the brain and, as a result, devalues all innately rewarding behaviors. Our findings suggest that localized dopamine release desensitizes local circuitry, causing the brain to devalue a specific behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians and researchers have long known that the desensitization of the D2R is the reason why it takes more and more drug to achieve the same effect within the context of addiction. However, up to now there was no evidence that this mechanism influences natural motivational behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demonstration of D2R desensitization in response to naturally released dopamine links this pathological mechanism to the natural ebb and flow of our individual drives. Better understanding of this mechanism could lead to new hypotheses for motivational control and how it becomes corrupted in addiction,” added Crickmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763676786681"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What mechanism reduces motivation for repeated rewarding behaviors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Desensitization of the D2 dopamine receptor reduces the impact of dopamine over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763676788115"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What natural behaviors did researchers use to reveal this mechanism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They studied repeated mating behavior in male fruit flies and how dopamine signaling changed across trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763676787884"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does this relate to addiction and everyday motivation loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The same D2R desensitization underlying drug tolerance also naturally drives loss of interest in repeated activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and motivation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3953565c55555c1743584a55564e795a5150555d4b5c574a1751584b4f584b5d175c5d4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joelle Zaslow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://childrens.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joelle Zaslow – Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02079-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Behavioral devaluation by local resistance to dopamine&lt;/a&gt;” by Michael Crickmore et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral devaluation by local resistance to dopamine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated experiences can cause behavior-specific fatigue. We use &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; to study this common form of motivational change, finding that prior matings make males more likely to abandon future copulations when challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that, during mating, dopamine signals through the D2-like receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to promote resilience to challenges that might otherwise cause the male to switch behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This motivating dopamine signal suppresses the output of the copulation decision neurons (CDNs), which can truncate matings when pushed past threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repetition-induced devaluation of mating results from β-arrestin-dependent desensitization of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R on the CDNs, rendering them temporarily resistant to naturally released or experimentally supplied dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When local desensitization to dopamine is prevented, the male shows no signs of fatigue, treating each mating as if it were his first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings explain a widespread motivational phenomenon and reveal a natural function for the notorious susceptibility of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R to drug-induced desensitization.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:18:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFA5TXJuQkVrVHN6U0VGVHphb3Z6Q3EzMEtwSmE3d2hFRHdmcnpHazBwdm94VFdqUXVab2dsQklXNjN1WEw3dTZEX0tMUk9PdVZaNGRGWnR1MU9pTlBxMkJKUVR2TUo1dw</guid></item><item><title>这些女性被诊断出患有肺癌。他们不符合筛查条件。- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/women-diagnosed-lung-cancer-werent-eligible-screening-rcna244868</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e057d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bharat’s research found that 65% of lung cancer patients at Northwestern didn’t qualify for screening based on the current guidelines.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Consuming ultra-processed foods can cause harm to major organs, in addition to a host of other health problems, a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday in the medical journal the Lancet revealed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.70086" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Another report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday from researchers at Virginia Tech shows that young adults are more vulnerable to indulging in ultra-processed foods, according to Brenda Davy, a professor in the school’s Department of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise, who helped conduct the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy told WTOP that people need to pay attention to what they’re buying to avoid ultra-processed food, which are dangerous to our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An ultra-processed food is most easily recognized by having ingredients that would not be used in home cooking,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her study tested young adults who were put on diets with ultra-processed foods. After two weeks, the adults aged 18 to 21 ate more calories using a diet that was high in ultra-processed food even though they weren’t hungry. But this wasn’t true for adults in the 22-25 age group, Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results suggest that adolescents may be more vulnerable to ultra-processed foods, which can be addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of ultra-processed foods include “things like Sunny Delight, rather than 100% fresh orange juice,” she said. “A Pop-Tart, which would be an ultra-processed food, compared to a homemade banana nut muffin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re shopping at the grocery store, if you pick up an item and look at the ingredient list, if you see things like ‘fat, flour, oil, salt, sugar,’ those are things that are typically used in home cooking,” she said. “Those would not be considered ultra-processed ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, if you saw very long-sounding chemical names that you do not recognize, that’s one tip off of an item considered an ultra-processed food,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the research released this week shows that these ingredients could be more dangerous than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are linked to increased risks of obesity and weight gain and a whole host of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in order to avoid ultra-processed foods, people should “prepare as many of their meals as possible at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That might help folks reduce their risk of some of these chronic diseases related to their diet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy said that there are some advantages to food processing by manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest advantages for using processed foods is that they do have a longer shelf life,” she said. “That is an important benefit of ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that one of the big drawbacks is how addictive they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They may drive us to overeat them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

"Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still recommended that people get vaccinated, Glanville emphasized, but protection will be "partial at best and worse than normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu immunity may also be weaker this year. As Jhaveri pointed out, immunity "increases after vaccination and natural infection" but wanes over time, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, based on Australia’s data, "we think the vaccine should offer the usual levels of protection," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk individuals — including those with chronic conditions, weakened immune systems or obesity, as well as pregnant women and young children — should take extra caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:children who die from flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;children who die from flu&lt;/a&gt; and flu-related complications have no prior risk factor," Jhaveri noted, emphasizing that vaccination remains "the first step in preventing flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hesitant to visit a clinic, a nasal spray vaccine was recently approved for either self-administration or for parents and caregivers, allowing families to vaccinate at home, Jhaveri noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glanville's company, Centivax, is "developing a universal flu vaccine, entering human trials in early 2026," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-reveal-troubling-signs-early-flu-trends-warn-unusually-bad-season" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNV0NpcEFhOVVKN3R6V25iUmViSzdGcl83RzRrcnlrOEFMWVkwUVZTSGxrZXVEQVJzMmItbThtd1JkNnlteDI5WHNlZElMcXNIVGE3YTN2WDM0TnFlRG9kX2VCNWhnNGNtZklwcXFnbnI0Sno5MmVza2lBSndqZ0JfZktjVm03ZE0</guid></item><item><title>在经历了前所未有的自闭症疫苗信息传递变化后，科学家、倡导者表示， CDC不再值得信赖- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/after-unprecedented-autism-vaccine-messaging-change-scientists-advocates-say-cdc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 80 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was respected around the world for its authoritative, evidence-based leadership in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC’s stunning reversal Wednesday—stating on its website that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism”—shows the agency can no longer be trusted, multiple doctors and public health advocates told CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until late yesterday, the CDC webpage accurately stated, “Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the CDC website echoes the views of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has claimed without evidence that vaccines cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html"&gt;website now states,&lt;/a&gt; “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A 'tragic day' for public health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a global leader in science, the CDC has devolved into “a propaganda machine for RFK Jr.'s fixed, immutable, science-resistant theories,” said Paul Offit, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. “The CDC is being weaponized to promote RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine point of view. So why should you trust it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many public health experts who spoke to CIDRAP News sounded sorrowful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today is a tragic day for public health, for the US government,” said Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (publisher of CIDRAP News). “Ideology has replaced science as the means for addressing life-saving research and best practices that save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many physicians worry that the CDC’s new message will dissuade parents from vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will cause real harm,” said Jake Scott, MD, an infectious disease expert and clinical associate professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents searching for trustworthy information will find official CDC language that appears to validate concerns that have been thoroughly debunked. Some will delay or skip vaccines. We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also removed scientific reviews of vaccines from its website. The website now rehashes conspiracy theories claiming that government scientists and the medical community have hidden the truth about vaccines, claiming, that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking scientists as dishonest and corrupt comes straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook, said Peter Hotez, MD, codirector of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who also helped develop an affordable, unpatented COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how the wellness influencer industry works,” Hotez said. “It’s not enough to push the snake oil. You have to discredit mainstream biomedical science and portray scientists as public enemies or cartoon villains, and that's what Kennedy’s seeking to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/public-health-officials-face-grim-new-reality-after-cdc-shooting"&gt;became the target of violence&lt;/a&gt; in August after a gunman who blamed COVID-19 shots for his depression &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/in-cdc-attack-man-fired-180-shots-breaking-150-windows"&gt;fired 180 shots into the agency’s&lt;/a&gt; Atlanta headquarters, killing a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent researchers from seven countries have conducted 40 high-quality studies involving 5.6 million people looking at the relationship between vaccines and autism since 1998. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There’s no link between vaccines and autism,” said Susan J. Kressly, MD, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents,” Kressley said. “We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy promised Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD, a Republican from Louisiana, that he would not remove statements on the CDC website that said vaccines do not cause autism. Cassidy's approval was critical in confirming Kennedy as HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to an interview request. But he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of vaccines on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,” Cassidy wrote. “What parents need to know right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s rejection of vaccine science undercuts the credibility of all federal government science, said Ari Ne’eman, PhD, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives people justifiable cause to be suspicious about anything that comes out from this administration regarding the science of autism,” Ne’eman said. “This reinforces this sense that RFK Jr.’s political judgments are being used in place of the scientific process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debra Houry, MD, the CDC’s former chief medical officer, said the agency’s scientists had nothing to do with the website change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists were not involved in any of these decisions, and when you remove science from scientific information you get ideology,” said Houry, who resigned from the CDC in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“T&lt;span&gt;his is what we have been warning Congress about—and yesterday on a webinar for health journalists I said I would not trust information on autism from CDC&lt;/span&gt;,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, allies of Kennedy are cheering the changes. "This is the biggest health reversal of our lifetime," Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/childrenshd/status/1991515222775906323?s=43&amp;amp;t=0dtS1Ti4eIH_z6yy-SmqoQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said on X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Autism community speaks out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autism community, which has long pushed back against the idea that vaccines cause autism, also criticized the changes to the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism,” said Alison Singer, MBA, president of the Autism Science Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The facts don’t change because the administration does,” Singer said. “At this point it’s not about doing more studies; it’s about being willing to accept what the existing study data clearly show. You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people have been sharply critical of Kennedy for his demeaning characterizations of people with the condition and description of the neurodevelopmental condition as a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t clear what further amount or type of proof or research would be enough to satisfy Kennedy or the CDC that autism isn’t caused by vaccines,” said Sam Brandsen, PhD, who has autism and is a part-time postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada. Brandsen’s son also has autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if vaccines were the cause of autism—which I don't believe—I would much rather have my child be his wonderful autistic self and have vaccine protection against deadly diseases than try to withhold necessary vaccines out of a fear of autistic traits,” Brandsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While hospitalized, the teen was placed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNPWXXVYHRCK5E5WE7EVZWZ22A"&gt;His parents said he took an evening dose of his long-acting insulin, but due to an insurance denial because his brand of insulin wasn’t listed on their health plan, the medicine he took was “potentially expired insulin.” His parents found it in the fridge and were hoping it would still be effective, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WCJ4UJFLIFEOZEHV2SZOT6HAUY"&gt;On the morning of Nov. 13, the teen was having chest pain, vomiting, and abnormal breathing, so his parents brought him to Penn State Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3FPN7VDYGNCNBAKHWB3HH5JSPQ"&gt;He had just been released from the hospital three days prior, on Nov. 10, for diabetic ketoacidosis.

While illness can trigger symptoms like vomiting, DKA is usually preventable with proper ketone monitoring and insulin use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PSADUNEIJFG4LMVEQ6LHP373V4"&gt;A doctor told police puberty may have played a role in the medical crisis, as puberty substantially increases insulin resistance, noting “typical challenges” parents face while trying to transfer responsibility for care to the child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVZLAOVAY5F6XHATYHF6A2AKGE"&gt;However, the doctor said the primary issue, due to the teen having “ADHD and psychiatric problems,” is that he needs adult supervision." Police said a doctor requested the parents attend diabetes education in September, but the dad was the only one who showed, even though the mom is the primary caregiver home during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GLWK47UQQVAZJHKNHMDBR4QT2E"&gt;The dad told police his wife didn’t show because she was “home sleeping.” He said she also likes to sleep during the day and stay awake late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ENJPAVE36JDP3CWYSUIKYWSENI"&gt;The last time their son’s long-acting insulin was filled was in January 2025.
