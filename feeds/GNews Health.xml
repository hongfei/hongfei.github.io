Jeff Landry has appointed Evelyn Griffin, a doctor who has worked on maternal mortality and voiced skepticism about vaccines, to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/ralph-abraham-vaccine-louisiana-cdc/article_5b8e4661-9d47-4da1-886f-1b11cf4ed6cb.html"&gt;Louisiana's next surgeon general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œHer clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role,â€� Gov. Jeff Landry said in a release Monday announcing Griffinâ€™s appointment. â€œWith Dr. Griffin stepping in, Iâ€™m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Griffin is a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the top vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was appointed to the panel by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has campaigned against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/national_politics/hepatitis-b-rfk-cassidy-vaccines/article_39be244b-cdd8-4919-a2a5-5109694add12.html"&gt;ACIP voted&lt;/a&gt; to end a three-decade-old recommendation that all infants get the Hepatitis B vaccine and issue weaker guidance for some newborns. Griffin supported that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In a news release announcing her appointment, Landry's office said Griffin's "work included a focus on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality." Louisiana's rates of such deaths is among the highest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin replaces Ralph Abraham, who recently left the statewide post to take a top position at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He drew scrutiny for his decision to end mass vaccination campaigns in the state and for casting doubt over COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After a bevy of tests, they found that KJ has an ultra-rare genetic condition, called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, that impairs the body’s ability to process protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body breaks down proteins, it produces ammonia — a toxic substance that is usually processed by enzymes in the liver and excreted in urine. CPS1 deficiency compromises one of these enzymes, causing ammonia to accumulate in the blood, which can eventually damage the brain. The condition can be treated with a liver transplant, but about half of all babies with CPS1 deficiency die in early infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of KJ’s doctors, paediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, wondered whether there might be another solution — correcting the faulty enzyme in his liver. She and Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had a bold plan to treat children with rare genetic disorders using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapies tailored to unique DNA sequences&lt;/a&gt;. KJ could be their first candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous gene-editing therapies were designed to treat many people. The first approved CRISPR therapy, called Casgevy, could potentially treat tens of thousands of people with one of two blood disorders. By contrast, KJ’s therapy would work only for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used an offshoot of CRISPR genome editing, called base editing, to target the problematic mutation — one faulty DNA letter out of the three billion in the human genome — and correct it (&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;K. Musunuru &lt;i&gt;et al. N. Engl. J. Med. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;392&lt;/b&gt;, 2235–2243; 2025&lt;/a&gt;). Such a hyper-personalized editing therapy had never been made so quickly; KJ might only have a few months before ammonia overwhelmed his small body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it took a large team of researchers in academia and industry to make it happen. While KJ charmed everyone he met at the hospital, Musunuru and his lab members shielded themselves from learning any personal details about him, even his name. “There were certain go or no-go points where key decisions had to be made,” Musunuru says. “We had to be objective with respect to the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing companies worked around the clock to make the gene-editing components needed to treat KJ. “We estimated that it would take 18 months,” says Sandy Ottensmann, a vice-president at Integrated DNA Technologies in Coralville, Iowa. “We did it in six.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 25 February, KJ received the first of three infusions. His tolerance for protein in his diet has increased, but he still needs medication and regular monitoring to ensure that his ammonia levels stay in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” said Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman. “It was very clear that there was no help coming … Thanks to Channel 9, you guys reached out to ODNR, and amazingly, they started to change their tune.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff and teachers at St. Bernadette’s School on Locust Lake Road returned from Thanksgiving break on Dec. 1 and found dead vultures spread across a campus where more than 200 children are enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school contacted Pierce Township Fire Chief Craig Wright for help, who said he reached out to ODNR for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(ODNR wasn't) overly concerned with the situation. They really had no intention to come out and do anything for the problem,” Wright said. “It did upset me. I was a little surprised. It’s a wildlife issue. There's no better agency than them to deal with a wildlife issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, Wright said he contacted local public health and emergency management agencies for help to come up with a contingency plan, while the dead birds remained at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big undertaking to clean up this many dead animals when you really don’t know or have the education or expertise to deal with that issue,” Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ODNR spokesperson said the agency does not typically collect dead wildlife, but decided to help “for this unique circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) has conducted testing of other dead wild birds in Clermont County, and we have been advised that those other birds are ‘presumed positive’ for HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) … once a presumed positive case is identified in a county, all additional dead birds found in groups of six or more are also presumed to be HPAI and are treated as such. Therefore, the vultures in this case are presumed to be positive for HPAI, however, ODNR is working to collect additional samples to send for testing due to this unique circumstance,” according to a statement from ODNR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-1"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman said he wants to know for certain if the vultures died from bird flu or were poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman and Wright both said that ODNR declined to test the birds. A spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health confirmed the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As is protocol in situations involving wildlife, the issue was originally reported to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which declined to test the birds,” according to a statement from public health spokesperson Krista Rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, given the potential risk to public health, we worked with our state partners to arrange testing. … On Friday, Dec. 5, two birds are being delivered to a state animal laboratory for testing. We expect results back early next week,” Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, dozens of seemingly healthy black vultures flew around the school on Friday morning. They perched in trees and on the baseball field fence near the carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman said he worries about more bird deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You also have a lot of geese that are in this area as well. So, all of those are flock animals, and they can be spreading this to countless areas inside Clermont County … and we would have no idea,” Freeman said. “There are a number of people very close by that have cattle operations, and it has been known that bird flu can jump to cattle … it starts to open up an entirely new avenue that deals with our food and our food supply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wright urged residents not to panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know why the birds have died. There's an assumption that it could be a bird flu, but they’ve not been tested to confirm that,” Wright said. “I’ve been assured by health officials that it’s a really low risk of transmission to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the testing comes back positive for bird flu, the current risk to the public is very low, Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transmission occurs through contact with respiratory droplets and bodily fluids from live birds. Transmission of bird flu in wildlife can increase in the spring and fall with bird migration. The current strain of H5N1 has been found in the wild and domestic bird populations since 2022 throughout the country, including Ohio,” Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-2"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierce Township residents who find dead birds are urged to contact the township fire department or the Ohio Department of Natural Resources at &lt;a href="tel:8009453543" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;(800) 945-3543&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:wildinfo@dnr.ohio.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wildinfo@dnr.ohio.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was provided to CNN Wire by an affiliate and does not contain original CNN reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

It’s a trend that experts worry could have deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32f367" class="body-graf"&gt;Babies are born with very low levels of vitamin K, a nutrient the body needs for blood to clot, leaving them at risk for severe bleeding early in life. In the early 1960s, hospitals in the United States began giving newborns shots of the vitamin within the first six hours of birth to prevent bleeding, including bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc2a87" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the leader of the study, said he and his co-authors noticed &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/vitamin-k-shot-hesitancy-babies-rcna57476" target="_blank"&gt;a rise in parents turning down the shot&lt;/a&gt; in their own practices, prompting the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dd84e" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Scott said, he wasn’t fully expecting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ffa1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The increase is not surprising, but the degree to which it did increase did catch me off guard,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de157f" class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed electronic medical record data from Epic Systems’ Cosmos database, which included whether an infant received a vitamin K shot. The study included more than 5 million babies born in 403 hospitals in all 50 states, from 2017 through 2024. The researchers found that about 4% of babies — about 200,000 — born in this time frame didn’t get vitamin K shots. The percentage rose from less than 3% in 2017 to more than 5% in 2024. The trend was highest among non-Hispanic white babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7585d5" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate really started increasing from 2019 to 2020, and accelerated during and after the Covid pandemic, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d379bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Scott said there haven’t been any large policy changes regarding vitamin K shots from hospitals, nor changes in recommendations from medical organizations. That means the rise in babies not getting vitamin K shots is almost certainly due to parental refusal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ddb54" class="body-graf"&gt;Reports of a trend go back before 2017. A 2016 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/6/1/15/26290/Reasons-for-Refusal-of-Newborn-Vitamin-K" target="_blank"&gt;Hospital Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; looked at why parents refuse the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739bf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Widespread misinformation on social media and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/life-changing-impact-diseases-anti-vaccination-era-rcna215968" target="_blank"&gt;rising vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt; are likely contributing to an uptick in the number of parents refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, said Dr. Tiffany McKee-Garrett, an associate professor of pediatrics at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-338a45" class="body-graf"&gt;“Parents are equating vitamin K injections to vaccines,” McKee-Garrett said, adding that a vitamin K shot is not a vaccine, but a supplement derived from a plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-297bbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ivan Hand, director of neonatology at NYC Health + Hospitals Kings County in Brooklyn, has also noticed the trend in his practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44bb6f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think this comes from general mistrust in authority that started probably in the later part of the 2010s,” said Hand, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f521d6" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2022, Hand co-authored an &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/3/e2021056036/184866/Vitamin-K-and-the-Newborn-Infant" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement&lt;/a&gt; on parents refusing vitamin K shots for newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64eef1" class="body-graf"&gt;Newborns who don’t get a vitamin K shot are more than 80 times more likely to have bleeding from vitamin K deficiency than those who get the shot, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Bleeding can happen up to six months after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-713eaf" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are creating a population of newborns who are at risk of bleeding,” Scott said, adding that this could include anything from bruising, to losing blood when the umbilical cord is cut, to gastrointestinal bleeding. “Bleeding into the brain is what we really worry about, essentially a stroke,” he said. “That can ultimately cause death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fc4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the drop in the number of infants getting the shot that doctors are seeing correlates to a rise in the number of cases of bleeding from vitamin K deficiency in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-421055" class="body-graf"&gt;Hand said he has not seen an increase in his practice, but added that he only sees infants just after they are born. Scott said he believes further research will find an increase in bleeding events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f77675" class="body-graf"&gt;“We know unequivocally that when infants do not receive vitamin K, they are at increased risk of bleeding,” he said, adding that at CHOP, there has not only been an increase in vitamin K refusal, but also an increase in bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38255a" class="body-graf"&gt;In Houston, McKee-Garrett has heard reports of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, something that was extremely rare for decades after the U.S. began widely giving vitamin K shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb9e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a preventable disease, so we shouldn’t be seeing it at all,” Hand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-494c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;In some countries, babies are given oral doses of vitamin K supplements. However, these &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8424792/" target="_blank"&gt;formulas can be inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; and each baby’s digestive system absorbs different amounts of the nutrient, Hand said, adding that breast milk is also not a good enough source of vitamin K to prevent deficiency. Oral vitamin K supplements also need to be given multiple times, whereas the vitamin shots only need to be given once. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862383/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Europe have also shown that while oral vitamin K supplementation may be effective in the first week of life, it may be much less effective at preventing late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can occur up to 6 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad663e" class="body-graf"&gt;“That late-onset bleeding, the bleeding that occurs internally, has a 20% mortality rate,” McKee-Garrett said. Some studies have found it to be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929546/" target="_blank"&gt;as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e451" class="body-graf"&gt;Because vitamin K shots have been widely given in the U.S. for more than 60 years, Hand said parents may not understand the risk of forgoing the prophylactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2d087" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These treatments have been so effective that people don’t understand the consequences. They have never seen babies with severe bleeding, so they think it doesn’t exist,” he said. “But you don’t see it because we are treating these kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQcEZSMEwxbHNsQjNzQklmY0JNT3JLTzRHMm9hdkhidzZtTzdzQW5nc1RPRWNGbTF6cko3VUpjRFdIQ1haSUhVZnNnbG81TUJBZDJYSkVaVEc5WTdJVVNOSVpra3lZSGVMMVZ5bnF3RGszZ3FXcmcydFp6dkE1MWQ3aFoyNnVPdk96RnhtUlNXY3BaV0huRl8zZGt2WHdDSENaU01tejZ4QUp3UjTSAVZBVV95cUxOcGZQZ09GT3NJNXpOa0wwZkhVS1NTREZ2Sko5b0FSSUpnUkY4U05BOVJtaXpsdnRNTENtMXZHMlVISUJTcVpGS1lJVWRSVkl6dHVHNUxUQQ</guid></item><item><title>癌症正在飙升，引发关于是否寻找癌症的争论-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/cancer-young-people-deaths.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:37:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE53Q21zX2lFTGF1bFo4aS1VaE1qZkpjOFJNakF0ZXUtV0FDYXRoOUVFOUIzRjluYjE2ZHhiSVZ2SGxxZ21jTUloMjlOLXBiVWhaLVpVa1JGaHlkci1OdVlqWXE3Mk1nT2p5MzNEV2paQXdxNEJlQmRVOUF0bGh1Zw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员表示，社交媒体的使用会损害儿童的注意力集中能力-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/08/social-media-damages-childrens-ability-to-focus</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Increased use of social media by children damages their concentration levels and may be contributing to an increase in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peer-reviewed report&lt;/a&gt; monitored the development of more than 8,300 US-based children from the age of 10 to 14 and linked social media use to “increased inattention symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Reseachers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Oregon &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Science University in the US found that children spent an average of 2.3 hours a day watching television or online videos, 1.4 hours on social media and 1.5 hours playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No link was found between &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/adhd-children-teenagers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ADHD-related symptoms &lt;/a&gt;– such as being easily distracted – and playing video games or watching TV and YouTube. However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/06/adhd-medication-drugs-risks-benefits-children-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; with symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Torkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMG11TmFRdjBYMWZlanc3ZFgyNFpzQ0U1NWlRMkIwdk1jQVQ5SFg0VDY0RXM4MkdPbXVZaU9SYTgyb2Y1em5uek9vUmdscURZWUZlUWw5bFc4a3p1QVlvWHBmelR1OXBRYmxuSVZFb19ZNmxITlU0RGwxc3dYOFVIUmRrVlhFd3RHWk05Y2Z5d05hbDJWR1dQdmdwN0xIelk</guid></item><item><title>新冠疫苗的五年：突破如何造成公共卫生危机-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03992-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_51796384.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_51796384.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A row of masked healthcare workers receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination in their left arms." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_51796384.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Almost 14 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered since the first jab was officially rolled out on 8 December 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Paula Bronstein/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 8 December 2020, a 90-year-old British woman became the first person in the world to receive a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Five years on, more than 13.64 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. Thanks to the rapid roll-out of these vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01559-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01559-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; no longer a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;turning point for public health&lt;/a&gt; — but the downstream effects haven’t all been positive, argues Kristen Panthagani, a physician at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. In March 2020, Panthagani started a newsletter called &lt;a href="https://youcanknowthings.substack.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://youcanknowthings.substack.com/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Can Know Things&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which originally focused on addressing rumours and myths about COVID-19 vaccines and public-health measures. It now explores how the miscommunication of science and health measures has &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/why-is-trust-in-vaccines-declining" data-track="click" data-label="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/why-is-trust-in-vaccines-declining" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;damaged public trust in vaccines and scientific research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; spoke with Panthagani about what public-health institutions can learn from the pandemic, and how they can rebuild trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking back at the past five years, what lessons have been learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic was a steep learning curve. Nobody in our generation had ever encountered anything like that before and we must remember what we were dealing with at the time. It’s easy to beat ourselves up looking back, but it’s important that we look at what we can learn from that time and how we can do better going forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03151-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_51657224.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Public trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we’ve seen declining trust in childhood vaccines since the pandemic. The miscommunication and distrust over COVID-19 vaccines and mandates has influenced the uptake of other vaccines. The United States is now at risk &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03769-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03769-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;of losing its elimination status for measles&lt;/a&gt;, and that is directly related to vaccine coverage. Once measles vaccination drops below 95%, we start to lose herd immunity. If that were to happen, I think it would be a clear sign of this declining trust in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have to consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03384-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03384-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;declining access to vaccines in many parts of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and the challenges people have getting health-care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened during the pandemic that eroded people’s trust in vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about vaccines has been circulating for decades, but the difference now is that it’s spreading more loudly and is becoming more mainstream. Public-health specialists and governments didn’t communicate well during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in colloquial language, the word ‘immunity’ has this connotation of perfect protection — for example, with legal immunity, the idea is that you’re protected against prosecution. So, many people thought that the COVID-19 vaccine would give them 100% immunity, but then some of their family members were hospitalized owing to COVID-19, or died, and now the message is that you need a booster every year. After a while, people say: “You told me this and I got something completely different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03119-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03992-8/d41586-025-03992-8_26931620.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;mRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel — what’s next for the technology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have gone a long way to tell people clearly, and early on, that the vaccines can be highly effective but are not perfect, and to acknowledge uncertainty in the data. There were scientists who were trying to do that, but it wasn’t the loud, predominant voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A calorie-restricted diet could slow down the aging that naturally happens in the brain as we get older, according to a new study of rhesus monkeys, and the findings could also be relevant to brain diseases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Boston University analyzed the brains of 24 rhesus monkeys (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that had been fed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-intermittent-fasting-or-calorie-counting-better-for-weight-loss-new-study-weighs-in"&gt;calorie-restricted&lt;/a&gt; or standard diets for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these lifelong dietary differences, the researchers found signs of healthier nerve communication and protection in brain tissue samples from the animals that consumed 30 percent fewer calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/dna.2021.0922"&gt;what we already know&lt;/a&gt; about diets with limited calories: By giving the body less fuel to work with, these diets can put the body's metabolism into a more efficient mode – which, in this study, appears to have protected against some of the cellular wear and tear that normally comes with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-gain-might-be-linked-to-lifestyle-instability-not-just-calories"&gt;Weight Gain Might Be Linked to 'Lifestyle Instability', Not Just Calories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While calorie restriction is a well-established intervention that can slow biological aging and may reduce age-related metabolic alterations in shorter-lived experimental models," &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/news-events/articles/2025/new-study-investigates-how-diet-may-slow-normal-brain-aging/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; first author, Boston University neurobiologist Ana Vitantonio, "this study provides rare, long-term evidence that calorie restriction may also protect against brain aging in more complex species."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-completely-new-cause-of-alzheimers-uncovered-in-our-brains-white-matter"&gt;specifically on myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the fatty coating around nerve fibers in the brain that protects them and speeds up communication between them.

In some cases, mechanisms designed to maintain good brain health actually go haywire and become harmful, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-revealed-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;leading to neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="184468" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="184468" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease become much more likely in old age – because brain cells are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;in a worse state&lt;/a&gt;, and their overactivity might cause some inadvertent damage, especially if the protective sheath around nerve cells is deteriorating with age, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have been &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb5153"&gt;revisiting the link&lt;/a&gt; between Alzheimer's disease and myelin decline, adding experimental evidence of myelin breakdown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12968"&gt;imaging data&lt;/a&gt; from people with rapid cognitive decline. This study adds another clue and a way to possibly intervene – through diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research was only carried out in a relatively low number of monkeys, their brains share &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.1350100306"&gt;plenty of similarities&lt;/a&gt; with humans, so there's good reason to think the findings might apply to people, too – something which future studies could look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dietary habits may influence brain health, and eating fewer calories may slow some aspects of brain aging when implemented long term," &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/news-events/articles/2025/new-study-investigates-how-diet-may-slow-normal-brain-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though as we're learning from other studies, there are many factors beyond diet that can influence brain aging, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-looks-older-when-youve-slept-poorly-study-finds"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/speaking-multiple-languages-may-slow-brain-aging-study-suggests"&gt;language learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.70298"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has higher rates of flu hospitalizations, emergency room visits and positive tests than it did at this time last year, state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said. People who haven’t gotten their flu shots should do so now, particularly since it takes two weeks to develop full immunity after vaccination, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is absolutely here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus activity is still low, Herlihy said. Viruses often peak at different times, which is good for the health care system because it limits the number of people getting sick at once, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries have also had an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evere-flu-strain-h3n2-us-response-outbreaks-canada-uk-rcna243431"&gt;early start to the flu season&lt;/a&gt;, but experts are waiting for further data from overseas before projecting if the virus will peak early, Herlihy said. Even if it does, though, the season often includes a long tail following the peak, or a second wave with a different virus subtype, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we reach the peak, the best-case scenario is we’re halfway through the season,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number and demographics of people who need hospital care for respiratory viruses doesn’t look unusual as of early December, said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth. The &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/vaccine-rates-fall-as-2025-marks-worst-flu-year-on-record/news-story/f344d7a3fa69d1af469de0d1c7a457ba"&gt;Southern Hemisphere did have a more-severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; over what we experience as summer, however, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So far, the numbers don’t look out of the ordinary, but we’re at the beginning,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;National experts have warned that this flu season could be severe, though not enough data has come in to know for certain. A flu subtype called H3N2 picked up seven mutations since last respiratory season. Countries have surveillance systems to look for any new mutations in flu viruses, though most end up being unimportant, said May Chu, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to remain alert,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early data from the United Kingdom and Japan suggest this flu season could be severe again, because immune systems haven’t encountered the variant known as subclade K before and it arrived too late to include in this year’s shots, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, said in a news conference. But the shot is still worth getting, even with imperfect protection, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lot better than nothing, and it’s the best thing you can do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Last season was the most severe for children since the 2009 swine flu pandemic. The CDC determined &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html"&gt;279 children died of flu complications&lt;/a&gt; and children’s hospitals reported &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33419/Rare-neurological-flu-complication-strikes-at?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;unusual neurological complications in kids&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom were unvaccinated. The government doesn’t track adult flu deaths precisely, but produced a broad estimate of somewhere between 38,000 and 99,000 in the most recent season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data doesn’t yet show whether subclade K is more severe than other types of H3N2, Herlihy said. It wouldn’t have to be to cause a severe season, however – if more people get the flu, the number of severe cases and deaths also will rise, even without a change in virulence, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of this is a numbers game,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the mutated variant, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season?utm_source=General+Interest&amp;amp;utm_campaign=240dcacfee-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_11_19_06_15&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-240dcacfee-465918388"&gt;early data from the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; suggests the vaccine is between 30% and 40% effective in preventing hospitalization in adults and about 70% effective in children. That suggests vaccine effectiveness is on the lower end of the normal range, Herlihy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25% of eligible Coloradans have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu vaccine this year&lt;/a&gt;, compared to 27% at the same time last year. The drop was sharper for COVID-19, from about 14% to 11%. Anyone 6 months or older who doesn’t have a medical contraindication, such as a severe allergy to the vaccine ingredients, can get both shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, vaccination rates also appear to be down. IQVIA, a health data company, estimated pharmacies and long-term care facilities provided about 27% fewer COVID-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IQVIA-Adult-Vx-Trends-FINAL.pdf"&gt;between early August and mid-November&lt;/a&gt; than they did during the same period last year. Flu shots dropped more modestly, by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These numbers aren’t just statistics. They represent real gaps in protection,” Dr. Bob Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said during a news conference Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When the brain's typical wiring patterns shift from the norm, it leads to psychotic disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="184295" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers have identified 'brainquakes' that disrupt the brain's connectivity in people who live with these conditions and experience debilitating psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping out the role these brainquakes play, the research team hopes to get a better understanding of common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-psychosis-may-be-fundamentally-flawed-study-finds"&gt;brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps a step closer to treatment interventions that can help manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint Where Extreme Moods of Bipolar Disorder Exist in Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, these brainquakes are an imbalance between the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2021.07.008"&gt;redundancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01070-0"&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt; of brain networks, whereby brain cell circuits process either shared or complementary information, respectively. Redundancy makes the brain more robust, while synergy allows it to extract more information from related inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of the people with psychotic disorders were noticeably &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-reveals-how-often-cannabis-triggers-psychotic-episodes"&gt;more unbalanced&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found, showing more irregular and random connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions," Qiang Li, a &lt;span&gt;computational&lt;/span&gt; neuroscientist at the TReNDS (Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science) Center in Atlanta, and colleagues &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed detailed brain scans of 1,111 participants, including 288 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;with schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, 183 with bipolar disorder, and 640 healthy controls. &lt;span&gt;Each scan lasted about five minutes, with the analysis tuned to find higher-order (more complex) interactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg" alt="Brain regions" class="wp-image-184298 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/BrainDomains-600x500.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184298" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers mapped brain domains and the communications between them. The left cortex of the brain is shown here, with regions affected by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder labelled, including sensorimotor (SM) and visual (VI) domains. (Li et al., &lt;em&gt;Mol. Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainquakes were detected 'rumbling' across the brains of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder far more than in the healthy controls, affecting brain regions linked to emotions, memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-discovered-a-new-human-sense-of-touch"&gt;sensory information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brainquakes are like active volcanoes, the researchers say, with particular networks in the brains of people with psychotic disorders showing a tendency toward sudden and regular disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since the participants were all considered psychiatrically stable during the experiment, and the scans were taken during a resting state, the quakes aren't necessarily linked to psychotic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the severe impact of psychotic states on multiscale critical brain networks, suggesting a profound alteration in the brain's complexity and organizational states," Li and colleagues &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research gives scientists a fascinating new look into the brains of people who live with psychotic disorders, though further studies will be required to track the pattern and the frequency of these brainquakes over periods longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work is needed to look at how brainquakes might affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-driving-choices-could-be-hiding-signs-of-future-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers say. At the moment, it's not clear if these disruptions are helping to drive psychotic disorders or are something that's a consequence of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is such a sophisticated network system that it makes picking apart the causes of conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder very challenging, though progress is being made. We're getting better at identifying people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-new-blood-test-predicts-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;at a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of these conditions, for example, through biomarkers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know about some of the triggers that can cause psychotic episodes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-potency-cannabis-linked-to-dramatically-higher-risk-of-psychotic-episodes"&gt;high-potency cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these discoveries tells us a bit more about what the brain is doing when it takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-discovery-helps-explain-how-cannabis-triggers-psychosis"&gt;a few steps outside of reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the latest figures, as many &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/psychosis/"&gt;as 3 in 100 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US will have a psychotic episode at some point in their lives – and while there are ways of managing these conditions, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-new-schizophrenia-treatment-in-decades-a-much-needed-alternative"&gt;continue to work&lt;/a&gt; on finding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-drugs-may-have-been-off-target-for-decades-study-finds"&gt;more effective treatments&lt;/a&gt; with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03367-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So, something that’s different from before — and for me to consider it as dementia, it needs to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is only expected to become more common in this country; recent research predicts 42% of American adults over 55 will have dementia in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding the signs of the disease and getting an early diagnosis, individuals and caretakers can better plan and prepare for the future, and potentially make decisions about care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis can also help folks potentially get access to treatments that can help slow the progression of certain forms of dementia, experts told HuffPost. (Dementia is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most common type.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early signs of dementia are important to know but can “run the gamut,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stephanie Nothelle" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nothelle&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, but there tend to be a few that often present first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Short-term memory loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the thing that people often think about is short-term memory loss, and that really is common,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the same thing as momentarily forgetting the word you want to use or a one-off absentminded moment, like forgetting to grab your hat before going out for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s something like “having a conversation with someone and then a couple hours later, not remembering the details of that conversation,” explained Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago, said that it’s also common for folks with short-term memory loss to repeat themselves in conversations and ask “the same questions frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A hard time holding on to things that they’ve learned recently. That’s a short-term memory issue,” Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Day, there are some real-world, practical issues he tends to look for as potential memory red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for people who have made mistakes, maybe with medications, where they wouldn’t have before [such as forgetting to take it or taking a double dose], perhaps some difficulty keeping track of appointments and keeping the days straight, needing more reminders for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short-term memory loss could also look like missing appointments or showing up on the wrong day or having difficulty finding their way along a familiar route, Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally more forgetful than others and have been that way all of their lives. That’s not worrisome. Instead, Day is concerned with “changes from before that are consistent or starting to become consistent, that are beginning to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble with the ‘planning part of your brain.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for people to experience trouble with “executive functioning,” which Nothelle describes as the “planning part of your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if you have a complex task, [for example] you have to plan a dinner party and you’re having a hard time doing everything involved ... there’s all these little logistics and things to keep track of when planning something like a dinner party,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have to remember your guest’s dietary restrictions, plan out a menu, shop for ingredients, cook, arrange serving dishes, clean, make cocktails and choose a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not able to do that anymore, that can be a sign that there’s something going on,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;While dementia can present in many different ways, short-term memory loss and personality changes are among the early signs of the disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personality changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way that I have seen it manifest is people will have changes in their mood or their personality,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a loved one who used to be very outgoing is now more shy or vice versa. Or maybe someone is more apathetic or, perhaps, more impulsive than they used to be. This isn’t normal aging or an older person just not having a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all just reflections of subtle changes in the brain,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consistent trouble finding the right word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint and reason people seek medical attention is word-finding difficulty, Day said. “Occasional difficulty coming up with a name, fine,” said Day. It’s also normal to sometimes forget the name of a common object, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s inconsistent, not a concern, but when this is an everyday thing and maybe even when it’s interrupting conversation, now that’s a sign of much more prominent word-finding difficulty that would warrant evaluation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Susceptibility to financial scams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that we need to be really, really aware of, and unfortunately just gets more and more common, is susceptibility to financial scams,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with dementia are at increased risk, and scammers know that, so they tend to prey on older individuals in the middle of the afternoon,” added Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is shame involved with falling for a scam, but scammers are getting smarter and sneakier, making it easier and easier to fall for the trick, noted Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you have a loved one who falls for one of these scams, it’s worth inquiring about their cognitive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is common, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy lifestyle habits &lt;a href="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can not only slow the progression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308f69e4b02cf3b175cc4e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;can not only slow the progression&lt;/a&gt; of dementia but can also help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, genetics put them at higher risk of developing dementia, but “even in people where there is a genetic component, there’s good evidence to say that all of the following still make an impact, and maybe make an even bigger impact,” Fleisher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, folks should follow the advice from their doctors when it comes to maintaining a healthy body — these habits also help maintain a healthy brain, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important things that I think about ... well, we should be screening for high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar problems, and treating or addressing those problems when they exist,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should also prioritize a good night’s sleep, he said, and manage things like sleep apnea — “addressing that and treating that effectively can really improve brain health and brain function, and, I think, decrease the risk of dementia in the future,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then there’s the day-to-day things, good brain housekeeping things, we all know we should be doing,” Day said.

&lt;p&gt;New archaeological research is turning a long-accepted idea about human evolution on its head—challenging the belief that meat was the cornerstone of early human diets and that plant foods only rose to prominence with the arrival of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a comprehensive study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10814-025-09214-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Archaeological Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, scientists present new evidence showing that early humans across multiple continents were gathering, cooking, and grinding wild plants tens of thousands of years before farming began. The data reveal a far more &lt;strong&gt;nutritionally diverse prehistoric diet&lt;/strong&gt; than previously understood, one that included a wide array of seeds, nuts, and starchy roots.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

Credit: Florin, S.A., Ramsey, M.N., Journal of Archaeological Research (2025)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This new perspective disrupts the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/these-prehistoric-paintings-which-arent-human-hold-a-secret-that-could-rewrite-human-evolution/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74787" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; conventional narrative of human evolution&lt;/a&gt;, shaped largely around hunting and animal protein. Rather than viewing plant use as a &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/150-million-year-old-fossil-flight-secret/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80809" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secondary adaptation&lt;/a&gt; or late innovation, the study positions it as a central feature of &lt;strong&gt;human dietary flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;, predating agriculture by tens of millennia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Grinding Stones and Root Ovens: The Evidence Beneath Our Feet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by teams from the &lt;strong&gt;Australian National University&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;University of Toronto Mississauga&lt;/strong&gt;, draws on archaeological data from &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/evidence-prehistoric-humans-isle-of-skye/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79524" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prehistoric sites&lt;/a&gt; spanning Africa, the Levant, Southeast Asia, and Australia. These sites have yielded grinding stones, charred plant remains, and cooking tools—direct evidence of &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric plant food preparation&lt;/strong&gt; dating back at least &lt;strong&gt;35,000 years&lt;/strong&gt;, and possibly much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;Ohalo II&lt;/strong&gt;, a lakeside site in Israel dated to 23,000 years ago, archaeologists recovered &lt;strong&gt;grinding tools embedded with starch granules&lt;/strong&gt;, along with well-preserved remains of &lt;strong&gt;wild wheat, barley, and legumes&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other side of the world, in &lt;strong&gt;Madjedbebe&lt;/strong&gt;, Northern Australia, residues found on stone tools suggest the processing of yams, seeds, and other &lt;strong&gt;starchy wild plants&lt;/strong&gt; more than &lt;strong&gt;65,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;—the oldest known human site on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/2025/12/humans-ate-plant-foods-long-before-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;These findings&lt;/a&gt;—now compiled and analyzed in one of the most extensive global reviews to date—undermine the long-standing belief that early humans relied primarily on hunting large game. Instead, the evidence shows a deep, widespread tradition of &lt;strong&gt;plant-based subsistence strategies&lt;/strong&gt; well before domestication began.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Humans Couldn’t Live on Meat Alone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a biological ceiling to how much lean meat humans can digest. Without adequate fat or carbohydrates, high-protein diets can lead to a condition sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;rabbit starvation&lt;/strong&gt;, characterized by nausea, weakness, and eventual metabolic failure. This means early humans needed more than just protein—they needed a reliable source of &lt;strong&gt;complex carbohydrates and plant-based fats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plant foods—especially those that required processing—offered a dense, portable, and renewable source of energy. Roots, nuts, and seeds, once cooked or ground, could provide vital calories for mobile groups crossing harsh environments like &lt;strong&gt;deserts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;highlands&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;savannas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Ramsey et al. and Clarkson et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study authors also emphasize the &lt;strong&gt;technological innovations&lt;/strong&gt; that supported this dietary flexibility. Tools such as &lt;strong&gt;grinding stones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pounding implements&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;earth ovens&lt;/strong&gt; allowed early humans to unlock nutrients from otherwise indigestible or bitter plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than reacting to food scarcity, these groups appear to have had extensive knowledge of &lt;strong&gt;local flora&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the techniques needed to process it. The scale and diversity of these behaviors suggest a long-term adaptation rather than an opportunistic survival tactic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rethinking the “Broad Spectrum Revolution”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, archaeologists described the late pre-agricultural period as a &lt;strong&gt;“Broad Spectrum Revolution”&lt;/strong&gt;—a time when humans expanded their diets to include smaller game and plant foods, leading eventually to domestication. But this new research challenges that framing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a sudden dietary expansion, the study proposes that humans were &lt;strong&gt;always broad-spectrum foragers&lt;/strong&gt;—a strategy that likely defined our species from its earliest phases. To reflect this, the authors introduce a new term: the &lt;strong&gt;“Broad Spectrum Species.”&lt;/strong&gt; In this framework, &lt;strong&gt;diverse plant consumption&lt;/strong&gt; is not a precursor to farming, but a long-standing evolutionary advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This adaptability may explain why &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, unlike other hominins, successfully migrated into such a wide range of ecosystems. The ability to harness both &lt;strong&gt;animal protein and wild carbohydrates&lt;/strong&gt; allowed for survival in regions where one or the other alone would not have sufficed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, roughly &lt;strong&gt;80% of the global human diet&lt;/strong&gt; consists of plant-based foods. This is often viewed as a byproduct of modern agriculture, but the research suggests otherwise. Our dependence on plants runs deeper—it’s rooted in tens of thousands of years of innovation, selection, and trial-and-error with wild resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one in five people in a German cohort had long COVID in 2022&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and around one in seven people in the United States were affected by long COVID by late 2023&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This translates to a significant burden on healthcare and the economy — the syndrome is estimated to cost the world economy US$1 trillion every year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From many conversations, I know what a great burden these illnesses represent for those affected and their families,” said Dorothee Bär, the German Federal Research Minister, in a press release announcing the funding. “There are still no simple solutions or therapies for ME/CFS and post-viral autoimmune diseases, and previous scientific studies demonstrate the complexity of the disease mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really major funding,” says Rafael Mikolajczyk, an epidemiologist at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, agrees, saying it’s “a great step in the right direction”. Long COVID has become politicized and “less of a priority for governments around the world,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What research is the money expected to support?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German government aims to fund research into a wide variety of post-infectious diseases, including Long COVID and ME/CFS. It also aims to cover a range of topics, including the pathophysiology and immunology of the conditions, diagnostics and biomarkers, mental health and neurology, and long-term consequences on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The language is deliberately broad, says Al-Aly, who under the Biden administration co-chaired the committee that created the US’s &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/storage/2022/06/Towards-a-Patient-Driven-National-Research-Action-Plan.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/storage/2022/06/Towards-a-Patient-Driven-National-Research-Action-Plan.pdf" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;National Research Action Plan for Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;. “You don’t want to shackle your scientists with a very narrow scope,” he says. He applauds the funding for including all post-infectious conditions, which share many commonalities, and for embracing a variety of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the German funding is not yet allocated, the next step is for scientists and patients to be brought in to shape exactly how the money will be spent, says Ulrike Protzer, a virologist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00995-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_50843280.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Long COVID activists fought Trump team’s research cuts and won ― for now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fundamental challenge for managing conditions like long COVID is to identify the mechanisms operating in each long COVID patient, says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut. Only then can they be recruited into clinical trials of medications that will treat these root causes. That means link biomarker studies to clinical trials, says Al-Aly – like giving antivirals primarily to people with persistent viral infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisreen Alwan, a public health specialist at the University of Southampton, UK, also wants to see more research characterising the public health burden of post-infection conditions. “How do we quantify the burden of acute infections in terms of chronic disease? What are the pathways to prevention? How can we address the risk factors?” She compares viral infections to outdoor air pollution, the impacts of which on cardiovascular health have now been quantified — spurring efforts to cut pollution levels. “that's where we should be heading for acute viral infections,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A woman in a striped knitted sweater looks at the camera from behind a cart loaded with medication bottles in her apartment." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03904-w/d41586-025-03904-w_51787688.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Long-COVID advocates and researchers in the United States managed to revive some of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00703-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00703-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Joe Klamar/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened with previous research drives?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A recipient of a kidney transplant presented a medical mystery when he died from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2017.91"&gt;rabies&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 only weeks after his surgery in an Ohio hospital, despite having had no documented contact with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close investigation by the CDC revealed the cause: The Michigan man's donor kidney was infected by the deadly  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; – only the fourth time rabies has been transmitted via transplanted organs in the US since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, the CDC says, highlights the need for stronger guidance for transplant teams where the donor has a history of exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rabies-is-a-deadly-unpredictable-threat-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabies Is a Deadly, Unpredictable Threat. Here's How to Protect Yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral pathogen that spreads typically via the saliva of infected animals, usually through bites or scratches. Capable of infecting all mammals, including humans, the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms appear; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0711"&gt;fewer than 50&lt;/a&gt; cases of survival have been documented worldwide, with medical specialists rarely succeeding in keeping patients alive despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaf157"&gt;extreme measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt; most often occurs from dog bites, but any infected mammal can transmit the disease. The donor in this case, an Idaho man, had been found unresponsive after a presumed cardiac arrest in early December 2024, around five weeks after being scratched by a skunk in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one suspected the involvement of rabies at the time. So as the man was an organ donor, his heart, lungs, left kidney, and corneas were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five weeks after receiving the kidney, the Michigan patient developed symptoms consistent with rabies. Doctors sent samples of his saliva, skin, and other fluids to the CDC, which detected rabies virus RNA in some of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the recipient had no history of animal exposure, investigators turned back to the donor. A stored serum sample from the Idaho man tested negative for rabies  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, but an archived biopsy of his kidney was positive for rabies virus RNA, confirming the organ as the source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan recipient died on the seventh day after hospitalization, but he may have saved other lives. The donor's heart and lungs were used for training at a Maryland research facility and did not pose a risk, but three other patients had received corneal grafts from the donor's corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors immediately removed the transplanted corneas and prescribed the patients a course of highly effective Post-exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP – human rabies antibodies plus a vaccine given before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials assessed 357 possible contacts of both the donor and the kidney recipient. In total, 46 people – including healthcare workers, community contacts, and the cornea recipients – were advised to receive PEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events highlights a vulnerability in the current donor system. While the donor's risk assessment interview documented the skunk scratch, his symptoms hadn't been recognized as consistent with rabies, so his skunk encounter wasn't raised as a testable rabies risk until after the kidney recipient had died as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since rabies testing on donor organs is not routine, and no one raised any red flags, the transplants took place as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies can take weeks to months to become symptomatic after transmission. The CDC advises significantly more caution with donors who have had a potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a potential donor, particularly one with acute &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"&gt;encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, had a bite or scratch from a rabies-susceptible animal during the preceding year, transplant teams should consider consulting public health officials to determine rabies risk," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;the organization writes in its report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If an organ or tissue has been transplanted from a donor who is subsequently suspected to have had rabies, a risk assessment could save lives by accelerating diagnostic testing, possible explantation when deemed clinically appropriate, and PEP administration to recipients and other contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see the CDC's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Human peripheral blood samples (32 ml) were collected from donors in BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tubes containing Sodium Heparin/Ficoll (BD Biosciences). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation at 1600&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min at room temperature (20–22 °C), followed by three washing steps with PBS and 10% FBS (LabTech) and centrifuged at 520 RCF for 10 min after each wash.

PBMCs were subsequently stimulated with 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L2630) for 4 h (37 °C, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). For the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation experiments, human PBMCs isolated as above (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; per condition) pre-incubated with TMAO (100 μM), PF06650833 (0.5 μM) or vehicle as indicated for 30 min were then stimulated with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 79346) and 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, I0634) for 4 h. Next, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min), and supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until further use. IL-6 and TNF were measured in the media diluted 1:10 in RPMI-1640 using the DuoSet ELISA kits (R&amp;amp;D, DY206 and DY210, respectively) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For PMA/ionomycin TNF measurements, the media were undiluted.

The following day, media were discarded and cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI-1640 containing 100 μM TMA, or RPMI-1640 vehicle for 30 min. PBMCs were then stimulated with LPS (1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for up to 60 min (times indicated in the corresponding figure legends). At the end of the stimulation, PBMCs were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, F8775) at room temperature for 20 min. Phosphorylation of IRAK1 (at Thr209) or NF-κBp65 (at Ser536) was determined in fixed PBMCs using commercially available ELISA kits (LSBio, LS-F1401-1 or LS-F891-1, respectively) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Readings were normalized to the levels of total IRAK1 protein determined in sister wells, which were treated identically. The dose-dependent impact of TMA (see corresponding figures) on phosphorylation levels of IRAK1 or NF-κBp65 upon LPS (1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) stimulation of PBMCs (for 10 min or 15 min, respectively) was also determined using the commercially available kits from LSBio as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Cell-based assays in primary human hepatocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes were commercially sourced (Innoprot) and cultured with hepatocytes medium (Innoprot) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% hepatocytes growth supplement (mixture of growth factors, hormones and proteins necessary for culture of primary hepatocytes) and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and streptomycin.

Insulin action was evaluated by measuring p&lt;sup&gt;Ser473&lt;/sup&gt;Akt1/Akt1 after insulin (100 nM, 10 min) stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;Thr209&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK1, total IRAK1, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser536&lt;/sup&gt;NF-κBp65, total NF-κBp65, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser473&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1, total AKT1 and GAPDH (as an endogenous control) were measured with specific colourimetric cell-based ELISA Kits (Assay Biotechnology Company, CytoGlow IRAK1 (CBP1425), CytoGlow NF-κBp65 (CBP1633) and CytoGlow AKT1 (CBP1490), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For data analysis, the optical density of target proteins (read at 450 nm) was normalized with cell nuclei crystal violet staining (read at 595 nm), which was proportional to cell counts. The analysis of cell-based assays was performed in a blind manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;Thr345/Ser346&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK4/IRAK4, p&lt;sup&gt;Ser176/180&lt;/sup&gt;IKKαβ/IKKβ, p&lt;sup&gt;Thr183/Tyr185&lt;/sup&gt;SAPK/JNK and p&lt;sup&gt;Thr180/Tyr182&lt;/sup&gt;p38MAPK/p38MAPK were determined by western blot. In brief, hepatocyte proteins were directly extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cellular debris and lipids were eliminated by centrifugation of the solubilized samples at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, recovering the soluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the RC/DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). RIPA protein extracts (20 μg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by conventional procedures. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against the following proteins: p&lt;sup&gt;Thr345/Ser346&lt;/sup&gt;IRAK4 (11927), IRAK4 (4363), p&lt;sup&gt;Ser176/180&lt;/sup&gt;IKKαβ (2694), IKKβ (8943), p&lt;sup&gt;Thr183/Tyr185&lt;/sup&gt;SAPK/JNK (4668), SAPK/JNK (9258), p&lt;sup&gt;Thr180/Tyr182&lt;/sup&gt;p38MAPK (9215) and p38MAPK (9212), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and β-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence, and quantification of protein expression was performed using Scion Image software. IL-6 concentration in hepatocyte media was measured using Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;amp;D Systems, D6050). All experiments were performed with at least three sample replicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19"&gt;Mouse models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Longitudinal HFD feeding in mice&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the University of Oxford.

For each sample, 10 μg of total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by in vitro transcription to generate biotin-labelled complementary RNA (cRNA). The cRNA samples were then assessed for yield and integrity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. After fragmentation, individual cRNA preparations were hybridized to the microarrays using a temperature-controlled Affymetrix hybridization oven. Post-hybridization washing and staining were carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Finally, the arrays were scanned at a wavelength of 560 nm with an Agilent scanner (Affymetrix).

Full-resolution &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectra were imported, and the area corresponding to the water region after water suppression (δ4.5–5.0) was discarded. The full-resolution spectra were then processed and analysed using O-PLS-DA as we had done previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Dumas, M.-E. et al.

Methylamines were derivatised with ethyl bromoacetate to increase sensitivity (the underivatized form elicited a low response from the mass spectrometer owing to its low molecular weight) and enhance chromatographic performance. A total of 935 μl of a protein/lipid precipitation solution (94% acetonitrile/5% water/1% formic acid) was added; samples were centrifuged for 20 min (4 °C, 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;) and transferred to UPLC–autosampler vials. Sample injections (10 μl loop) were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC-Xevo TQ-S UPLC–MS/MS system equipped with an Acquity BEH HILIC (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) chromatographic column.

Positive electrospray (ESI+) was used as the ionization source, and mass spectrometer parameters were set as follows: capillary, cone and source offset voltages at 500, 93 and 50 V, respectively; desolvation temperature at 600 °C; desolvation/cone/nebulizer gases were high-purity nitrogen at 1,000 l h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 150 l h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 7 bar, respectively. Collision gas was high-purity argon. The mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode.

It is typically spread through particles in the air or contaminated surfaces. The disease does not affect humans; however, people can inadvertently spread the disease from one horse to another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The State Department of Agriculture reported that one horse at the Lancaster County farm had to be euthanized due to the severity of the disease. The other horses have had to undergo quarantine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Equine Disease Communication Center said it is monitoring a large number of equine herpesvirus cases connected to an outbreak that originated at a Women’s Professional Rodeo Association event in Waco, Texas, in November. So far, at least 60 cases of equine herpesvirus linked to that outbreak have been reported in eight states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cases of equine herpesvirus in Lancaster County have not been connected to the outbreak in Texas, according to the report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Pennsylvania Equine Council, signs of equine herpesvirus in an animal can include a fever of unknown origin, nasal discharge or coughing, lethargy and neurological signs such as stumbling or loss of coordination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond when contacted for additional information Sunday. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

One, two, a few, several? If you’ve taught your algorithm that you’re open to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-treatment-natural-remedy-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;alternative wellness solutions&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is likely more than zero. Perhaps you’ve been made to bear witness to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgD_LOx_5q/?igsh=bmRic3doZDdhYnR0"&gt;long, gnarly, brown ropes&lt;/a&gt; laid out on paper towels. Maybe you’ve seen a pile of what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIhAtuozWtM/?igsh=MXhld2V3a2s5eHRtZQ%3D%3D"&gt;spaghetti squash&lt;/a&gt; floating in a toilet. You may have been treated to pics of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-_wZlOJAq/?igsh=YWJpbHNrN3F0b2Zy"&gt;shriveled, dried-apricot–like bits&lt;/a&gt; harvested from a stranger’s feces. Given the many poop posts, you’d be forgiven for believing that the entire internet-using population is teeming with intestinal worms, which these posters say they’ve expelled with “parasite cleanses” before snapping a pic and slapping up a Reel or TikTok to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitatlk3001g3b78fp5ujh0w@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;Over the summer, supermodel &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/heidi-klum-parasite-cleanse-update.html"&gt;Heidi Klum&lt;/a&gt; unwittingly stoked parasite panic by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/heidi-klum-project-runway-return-routine-d0292c92"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;she was undertaking her first cleanse. “Everything I’m getting on my Instagram feed at the moment is about worms and parasites,” Klum said in the interview. “I heard that you’re supposed to do this once a year, and I’ve never done it. So I feel like I’m really behind. I don’t know what the heck is going to come out.” By November, Klum had cleansed, but the results were unclear. “So many people asked me, too, like, ‘What happened?’” she told &lt;a href="https://people.com/heidi-klum-reveals-results-worm-cleanse-exclusive-11853373"&gt;&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m like, ‘I don’t even know if anything happened!’” There had been no smoking gun, no writhing toilet of expelled creatures — but also no statement of regret. In fact, Klum exclaimed that “it just felt good,” since any parasites that might have been there “were leaving the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswc2000c3b782y5l3mv5@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;Klum had embarked on the endeavor repeating an adage often spouted by those in the cleanse community: &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; has parasites, and they just don’t know it. A common stat bandied about is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8GXs4qwrw"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; percent of the population. Wild as the figure may sound, the notion has just enough plausibility to pass many folks’ b.s. detectors. Don’t tiny, imperceptible mites live on our eyelashes? Don’t dogs get worms, scooting their butts on the carpet for relief? Is it then so crazy to think that wriggling menaces may have colonized our colons, too? Toss in the ardent proselytizing of online “experts” and those eye-popping photos, and you can see how someone might be swayed. It also doesn’t hurt that cleanses are made to seem “natural,” almost spa-like, consisting of earthy stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z8OQGW/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B004Z8OQGW&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=7JegY&amp;amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=7446a9d1-25fe-4460-b135-a60336bad2c9&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=6KPVXF5QRJN01398T2RC&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=3F7kw&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=0c0d1fdb-5bee-4c2e-ba3a-5d1ec68e16ff&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;black walnut, wormwood, clove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Cleanse-Tincture-Wormwood-Burdock/dp/B0DYDFHTF1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;burdock root&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Advanced-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B078NCFVVJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=27PCYLMKMUKHC&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wYdlgiKKHJg2VkdNBBYI0w-zh4UHUI-lVfekSxUs-YY4ORxdPEXkc4YmqF_49QOgnnlQHOYkfl7fVd64TPCJW5jIHpzBlv3eysd_uHA6rsli1iJZGHg4TGX7FuAPpQMrIdXfHgarnOzZ6yHaIb4IJxABR6oykJY03_vGDV2ycV6MQVD1BNxNDlGc2X13QeaNwhwHLIGCy9svUMx2ykF482ucP6zRcwnXbYS1E4RnuCV9Y_uRWXI0hEBAmOKozcxAy2oRBafe_br3Beo0Y9p1OIsxAbsEmypirC1YQs62_F4.YhXy1H9ugtPt4SkwftJj1VwVUjUJ-tyjrLz_B988TwQ&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Bfor%2Bhumans&amp;amp;qid=1763860877&amp;amp;s=hpc&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Chpc%2C100&amp;amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But trying to dissuade cleanse believers often only deepens their conviction. Disavowal by the medical community is viewed not as scientific sensemaking but as, at best, dogmatic myopia, and at worst, evidence of a shady allegiance to Big Pharma — a desire to keep you sick so they can sell you bogus cures. As is true of many facets of American life these days, parasite mania seems to be a disagreement between two realities: one in which the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;medical Establishment is the utmost health authority (or at least it was until recently), and one in which &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; care is purveyed by the truth tellers this same Establishment shuns.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s more complicated than, say, vaccine hesitancy, in which one side is demonstrably correct and the other side refuses to believe it. With intestinal worms, we face a paradoxical truth: They are both less common and more common than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswj7000g3b788jnj1z5k@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“A lot of the people who feel they are infected with parasites are not,” says Dr. Daniel Griffin, a clinical instructor of medicine and infectious-disease specialist at Columbia and president of &lt;a href="https://parasiteswithoutborders.com/our-mission/"&gt;Parasites Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, an advocacy organization dedicated to addressing global parasitic illness. “But the other side,” he continues, “is that people out there actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; having issues related to parasites but are not being diagnosed.” The double-edged sword of parasitic infection is that its symptoms — diarrhea, bloating, nausea, gas — are common enough that one could attribute them to anything from indigestion to a hangover, but these symptoms are also common enough that, if someone told you everyone has worms and you believed them, those symptoms might be enough to convince you that you have them, too. Ask a roomful of people if they’ve had diarrhea, bloating, nausea, or gas in the last month, and 90 percent are likely to raise their hand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswkq000h3b78w4umiswm@published" data-word-count="171"&gt;Parasites Without Borders’ work makes clear that the scope of the problem varies by region. A &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the global population has some form of intestinal worm, known as a helminth, though that jumps to as high as 50 percent in tropical and subtropical regions. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Most&lt;/a&gt; helminths spread via human feces, especially in places where people defecate outside; when feces contains worm eggs, the soil it touches becomes contaminated, and if that soil is used to grow food, the parasite spreads. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/intestinal-parasites"&gt;Hookworms and strongyloides&lt;/a&gt;, however, can latch onto a host through the soles of their feet if walked on barefoot; tapeworms and trichinella can enter your body through undercooked meat; and flukes can be caught by ingesting contaminated water or fish. The most common global helminth is &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;, a roundworm that affects 1 billion people worldwide. While helminths are generally not deadly, if allowed to proliferate, some can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;bowel obstruction, inflammation, and chronic malnutrition&lt;/a&gt; in children; if the host is pregnant, some worms can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11095845/#:~:text=Infection%20in%20pregnant%20women%20can,increased%20mortality%20and%20low%20birthweight.&amp;amp;text=The%20life%20cycle%20begins%20when,for%20up%20to%2010%20years.&amp;amp;text=Symptoms%20are%20based%20on%20disease,is%20no%20sterilizing%20host%20immunity.&amp;amp;text=Diagnosis%20is%20made%20by%20direct,egg%20excretion%20in%20the%20stool.&amp;amp;text=Formol%2Dether%20concentration%20techniques%20and%20NAATs%20have%20increased%20the%20sensitivity.&amp;amp;text=Infection%20is%20treated%20either%20with,a%20single%20dose%20of%20albendazole.&amp;amp;text=In%20endemic%20areas%2C%20it%20is,water%20supply%20and%20sewage%20treatment."&gt;detrimental&lt;/a&gt; to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;

Pinworms live in the digestive tract and can be diagnosed using the “tape test”: After the suspected host falls asleep, pinworms venture out to lay eggs, and a piece of tape is placed on the anus to capture them. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21137-pinworms"&gt;Two doses of an anti-parasitic&lt;/a&gt; and a load of laundry later (to rid bedsheets and clothes of eggs), the host is cured. But treatment requires diagnosis, and hosts don’t always know they have pinworms — around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6522669/#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20have%20also%20been,seek%20medical%20advice%20(4)."&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; percent of cases are asymptomatic. Even if symptoms are present, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Parasitology/comments/1behxom/did_my_pinworms_really_dissapear_by_themselves/"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.pinworms-care-instructions.ut3181"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; may be too embarrassed to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswom000j3b789ukxbi69@published" data-word-count="133"&gt;Another paradox: While you’d think the panic over ubiquitous parasites would help more people with actual worms get proper care, the trendy nature of the topic may be &lt;em&gt;worsening&lt;/em&gt; the problem of underdiagnosis. “A lot of people self-diagnose with parasites, then come to a doctor with a little container of their feces not for us to make a diagnosis, but to confirm their conviction,” Griffin says. “They can be difficult. They can be hostile. Most doctors, to be honest, will put delusional parasitosis at the top of their differential, and things just go south from there.” In other words, even if you’re right, telling a GP you have worms and refusing to entertain other possibilities might get you written off as just another internet faddist or maybe even someone with a mental-health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitaswq6000k3b78b8yo8vkd@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Delusional parasitosis is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541021/#:~:text=Delusions%20of%20parasitosis%20is%20a,primary%20presentation%20or%20secondary%20presentation."&gt;usually secondary&lt;/a&gt; to another psychiatric condition, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and while recorded cases are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6861047/"&gt;exceedingly rare&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated that many people with the condition go undiagnosed since they don’t visit a mental-health professional to discuss it. Instead, because they are certain they have a parasite, they see a medical doctor. “You can imagine how challenging that can be for many physicians,” says &lt;a href="https://manhattancbt.com/paul-greene-phd/"&gt;Paul Greene&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Manhattan Center for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, who has expertise in health anxiety. “They have to rule out the presence of parasites, but they’re really dealing with a psychiatric condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

To the wide, unregulated, FDA-unapproved world of parasite cleanses, sold on Amazon, on Etsy, and by countless independent cleanse purveyors. While it’s difficult to gauge exactly how many people use them, Amazon reviews give some indication: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zahler-ParaGuard-Digestive-Intestinal-Certified/dp/B016LBZSDK/ref=sr_1_9?crid=8UWUS5TVYSG0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TjZyHd6WUmsyC_ZhdTaJ5AA6gmGZNtIRxUTlu1RjDMgYWq1nsnt2h3bls-YZJXI5HcxaXeYEc9TLRs3udtHQJ9lgNyBvvZf9xaymnokZ-qUk9kekeKMpuxtPmlzl1aRQIRukcm5giHG4UPAtEQrvcpEP-umJz7MSmwZovYm82XytqqORIHWGL_9atoMMXzlEGvc9KrLrFdyYRm2AihJfnLZGkXE5boZy3xvkMWmvWcukg8a1vNWB0oC3q5KgIBfMAuzLOITe90rjrV6ZO8CQFR_4FAEut1tITcWXLTH-NKE.f-zwkLpvOr3bfZhzxStDLJ-FIQ1VhSNOR0ponF-_h-4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=parasite%2Bcleanse&amp;amp;qid=1764078199&amp;amp;sprefix=parasite%2Bcleanse%2Caps%2C146&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c21208aam__cmitahj2j00000idtv849digh__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;ParaGuard&lt;/a&gt; ($29.90), one of the most popular options, had 30,451 reviews at press time. Interestingly, some of these clearly parasite-invoking options don’t actually use the word &lt;em&gt;parasite&lt;/em&gt; in their product descriptions, most likely because the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/questions-and-answers-health-claims-food-labeling"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; supplement manufacturers from making medical claims related to treating disease. Many people, however, opt for cleanses they read about in online testimonials or hear about via word of mouth — which is precisely how Shannon Nesbitt, of Kauai, found her favorite cleanse, &lt;a href="https://www.thesanctuaryholisticwellness.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor4YE9VCG3-NPwnNdgV8b8NwdTa99vkZlvqs8KAhlyqZ0g03_jg"&gt;Sanctuary Holistic Wellness&lt;/a&gt; ($377). “My friend did it,” says Nesbitt, who is 55, “and she’s vegan, and she had all these worms come out — so I figured if she has them, I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have them.” Nesbitt suffered from constipation and, after her friend’s experience, wondered if parasites might be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasx00000n3b78a6djk62s@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;The cleanse took a week and consisted of once- or twice-daily enemas, unlimited fruit and puréed soup (but no other solid foods), various teas and tinctures, green shakes, probiotics, prebiotics, psyllium husk, and bentonite clay dissolved in water. It was recommended that the cleanse be conducted around the time of a full moon. The psyllium husk was to be taken only with Concord grape juice. One day, Nesbitt ingested a mixture of olive oil, ruby-red grapefruit juice, and Epsom salts before lying on one side, per the instructions; this was to purge gallstones, and she says she passed hundreds the following day. Then there were the worms: “I was surprised,” Nesbitt says. “There were these big, long, white worms, and a lot of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/liver-fluke"&gt;liver flukes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

A cleanse isn’t a onetime medical treatment so much as a long-term self-care routine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasx9n000r3b784rp4cf0t@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;In poking around the vast array of cleanse-related Instagram posts, I saw a comment a woman had left about one she liked. I messaged her to talk. She replied, but I was confused when she referred me to her husband, Christian — until it turned out that he isn’t just a fellow fan of parasite cleanses but actually recommends them as part of his health-coaching business, &lt;a href="https://www.healingunited.today/home"&gt;Healing United&lt;/a&gt;, which he runs alongside his business partner, a primary-care doctor in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxkf000s3b78tdwvoj1j@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;“We’re all growing more toxic by the year,” Christian Elliot says over Zoom. “There’s a reason why worms find a home inside of us.” Certified as a nutritionist and personal trainer, he first came to parasite cleanses as a patient who wanted to know what he’d found in his poop. “In about 2013,” he says, “I was on a cruise, and I passed a foot-long worm as thick as a No. 2 pencil. And you kind of go, &lt;em&gt;If that’s in me, maybe it’s not the only one&lt;/em&gt;.” Elliot went to a naturopath, where he underwent two stool tests that came back negative for parasites; still, he tried her worm protocol. “I couldn’t make it all the way,” he says. “It was two weeks of suffering. I was in so much pain from the die-off.” (In the cleanse world, this refers to an extinction burst of toxins released as parasites and bacteria gradually die inside of you.) Another cleanse he tried induced “one hot-fire bowel movement, but no worms came out that I could see.”&lt;/p&gt;

He turned to the practitioners he’d been working with at Healing United, which, he says, was initially founded as a means of detoxing people injured by COVID vaccines. (Other topics Elliot touched on during our chat: chemtrails, changing the MMR vaccine schedule, and the potential dangers of fluoride.) Ultimately, Elliot and his team landed on a complex program of tinctures, herbs, fiber, “binders” (a material that attaches to dying parasites’ toxins to help flush them out, like clay), and three weeks of daily enemas. He says the results are startling. “I had a client two weeks ago who told me, ‘I just passed what looked like a bowl full of angel-hair pasta.’” Elliot says he himself passed “a bowlful” of pinworms (is a bowl the standard unit of worm measurement?), along with many red, marble-size liver flukes.&lt;/p&gt;

Turpentine, castor oil, these are wildly effective at poisoning. Tapeworms especially don’t like turpentine; they hate it.” He also mentions the benefits of clay, charcoal, and a half-dozen essential oils.&lt;/p&gt;

While he concedes that emergency services and trauma care are worthwhile uses of traditional medicine, he’s philosophically opposed to its other applications. “It sounds hyperbolic, but it’s anti-human. It’s symptom, symptom, symptom. ‘Don’t bother me with why this is happening, I just want to treat your symptom,’ which leads to another symptom and another. The model of pharmaceuticals is chemical intervention, and they’re trying to figure out how much poison they can give you without giving you a side effect or killing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

(A recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DND8NkEMQFj/?igsh=MXU0cnFpeWM1ZmdpMQ%3D%3D"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; was titled “Parasite Cleanses are Not a Real Thing,” with the caption, “I cannot believe how y’all want to waste your money with these online grifters.”) When we speak, I tell her about turpentine enemas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxx300113b78i9lpqyx0@published" data-word-count="111"&gt;“Oh, lovely,” Wallace says witheringly. “And so often the people selling these cleanses are laypersons — like, I already roll my eyes at naturopaths and chiropractors, but this isn’t even that, you know? And if I did that cleanse and got really sick, that person is not going to take any responsibility for me because they’re not a medical professional. They don’t see the end result of what they’re doing.” (The website of Elliot’s company mentions that “a doctor and a coach” are available for “Code Red” calls should any unpleasant symptoms arise — but nowhere does it recommend simply going to the ER if a Code Red situation should occur.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxyg00123b78zmu0w041@published" data-word-count="25"&gt;But what accounts for all the positive reviews for cleanses — what exactly are folks seeing when “worms” come out of them by the bowlful?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasxzs00133b78893np9v1@published" data-word-count="169"&gt;“Mucus,” Wallace says. “Undigested food. Intestinal lining. You ever notice how none of the ‘worms’ are moving?” Dr. Griffin told me something similar — that sloughed-off bits of intestine and fibrous vegetables that don’t get fully broken down can look like worms, provided you don’t know what worms look like. None of the photos he’s seen online or unsolicited specimens he’s viewed in person show segments on the worms, which is characteristic of tapeworms, and he’s yet to see any that are moving, the way pinworms would be. The Mayo Clinic also has an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/expert-answers/gallbladder-cleanse/faq-20058134#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20a%20gallbladder,below%20and%20resubmit%20the%20form."&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; for those hundreds of “gallstones” Nesbitt passed: Because most gallstone cleanses involve olive oil, what cleansers are seeing is just globs of “oil, juice, and other materials.” Wallace continues, “Normal people are not passing these things; it’s likely a result of the cleanse — just not in the way they think. Not to mention that half the time online they don’t show a picture of what came out; they just &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; it came out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy1g00143b78gvdu5nta@published" data-word-count="13"&gt;But why do they feel better? Why did Shannon Nesbitt’s constipation go away?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy2u00153b78i7s781r2@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Griffin had an answer for this: “Possibly because the cleanse has accidentally corrected a dysbiosis,” he says, referring to an imbalance of microorganisms in the gut. “In their head, they think, &lt;em&gt;I feel better because I treated my parasite&lt;/em&gt;. The reality is they might feel better because they’ve improved their microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy4800163b7828qnue1s@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;“What gets me,” Wallace says, “is that ivermectin is an anti-parasitic, but they want to use it for everything &lt;em&gt;but &lt;/em&gt;parasites. They want to use it for COVID, for cancer. It’s like, this is its time to shine, people.” (Ivermectin’s star turn began during the pandemic, when a rash of skeptics began using the dewormer, which is generally used in livestock, to treat COVID against the advice of doctors.) When Wallace says “they,” she seems to mean some variation on &lt;em&gt;people who don’t trust science&lt;/em&gt;. Without ever mentioning them by name, I get the feeling that we’re talking about adherents to and peddlers within the MAHA movement, who, alongside their own legitimately worm-bedeviled leader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., believe they’ll Make America Healthy Again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy5m00173b78eyrjrpu8@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;“There’s never been studies on these cleanses,” Wallace says. “There’s no data, absolutely no science behind it, other than the reports we’ve seen of people with liver damage from taking supplements because they don’t know what’s in them. But that really doesn’t matter to these people. They go off personal narrative and appeal to emotion. And that’s effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy7100183b78z74yjbta@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Maybe all parasite-cleanse purveyors are “grifters.” But it seems equally likely to me that some are merely gullible; after they saw their “worms” in the toilet, they decided to “help” others, too. Surely others are fed up with America’s exploitive medical industrial complex and are looking for a way around it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasy8l00193b78r87ra042@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;“I think some of it is distrust of the health-care system,” says Wallace, seeming to intuit my thoughts, “and this idea that doctors just want to make money by peddling pharmaceuticals. But if you see a doctor for an anti-parasitic, yes, the visit might cost money, but you’d take a couple doses of generic medication. Whereas if you go on Instagram and buy months of this regimen, that’s way more money.” Wallace also acknowledges that internet medicine may be the only kind some people can access: “Maybe they don’t have insurance, so these wellness fads are something they do in lieu of going to the doctor. They think they’re really doing something good.” Or maybe there are, as she says, “just a lot of fringe ideas online. I mean, there’s a whole Facebook group for people who drink urine for health reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasya7001a3b78ulhvlkov@published" data-word-count="100"&gt;The parasite-cleanse trend could be a product of simple fear — a collective psychological response to a world that feels like it’s invading us. We’re told constantly that our bodies are full of things we can’t see: forever chemicals, microplastics, phthalates, Bisphenol A, mercury, lead. We don’t know where our food comes from; it just shows up in the grocery store in a way that feels both mundane and sinister. Who touched it on its way there? &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; touched it? I ask Griffin what he thinks about it all. What would possess someone to believe they were crawling with worms?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmitasybj001b3b78ze5wg2hq@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;He thinks it might be that no one has helped them feel better — that they’re sick and suffering, and seeing a doctor hasn’t helped. “If a person isn’t feeling well, and they’re searching for answers,” says Griffin, “and they find something that might give them one, they don’t want that taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;

                Research shows our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age, because of changes in metabolism.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a drink or two at a holiday party went down the hatch with no problems. Now, it's a recipe for misery the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Christmas&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Chicago Medicine says it's a common lament as people enter middle age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You are not alone," Christmas says. "I am in that age range too and absolutely, [drinks] need to be spread out or it's all going to go straight to my head and I will need to sleep half the day away the next day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are physiological explanations for why our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age.  For one thing,&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18090653/" target="_blank"&gt;  studies show &lt;/a&gt;the liver enzymes that break down alcohol become less efficient. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That means that our bodies metabolize alcohol a little bit differently," she says. "We also lose more muscle as we get older, and that muscle is replaced by fatty tissue."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That's important, because muscle stores water and that water dilutes alcohol in our blood, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3542/johannes-thrul" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Thrul&lt;/a&gt;, an alcohol and substance abuse researcher and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He says having less muscle mass means alcohol will hang around in our bodies longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What this means is that the same drink that previously maybe felt just fine now leads to a higher blood alcohol level," Thrul says. "You feel the effects for longer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These changes happen to both men and women as they enter middle age. But for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5398547/perimenopause-menopause-symptoms-hrt-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;women in perimenopause,&lt;/a&gt; alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms that come with hormonal fluctuations — like mood swings and irritability, says Christmas, who directs the Menopause Program and Center for Women's Integrated Health at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol already is known to be a depressant," she says. "It can all also increase baseline anxiety symptoms. Alcohol can disrupt sleep too. If you're already experiencing all of those symptoms, it's just that much more compounded."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While worse hangovers as you age might not seem like a good thing, think of it as your body nudging you in the right direction. Cutting back is a good idea, says &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/kenneth-koncilja/4269493" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ken Koncilja&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician with the Cleveland Clinic, because the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5245794/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;risks of drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt; increase with age. That includes an&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; increased risk of cancer, &lt;/a&gt;liver disease, worsened high blood pressure, memory problems and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol use can cause dementia," he says. It can also interfere with many medications and lead to balance problems and more falls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Koncilja says he makes it a point to discuss the benefits of cutting back with his patients. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These conversations about alcohol use — being proactive in people with people in their 50s and 60s — has a huge impact on their health and wellbeing when they're in their 80s and 90s," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Johannes Thrul of Johns Hopkins says many people don't realize that alcohol is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/not-just-a-hangover--the-surgeon-generals-advisory-on-alcohol-and-cancer-risk.h00-159776445.html" target="_blank"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; — in the same category as tobacco and asbestos. "Every drink you have essentially increases your cancer risk for multiple types of cancer," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thrul says while the healthiest option is to not drink at all, even small changes to cut back can offer health benefits. For example, during holiday parties, he says try alternating alcoholic drinks with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/09/nx-s1-5251653/looking-to-have-fun-without-alcohol-this-guy-has-ideas-that-may-help" target="_blank"&gt;mocktails or other non-alcoholic options&lt;/a&gt;. And make sure to drink plenty of water to help your body metabolize the alcohol you do imbibe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Why don't you just give it a try and see how it feels?" Thrul says. "Because you might be surprised how good it actually is when you sleep better, you have less anxiety the next day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says your body will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Multivitamins have quietly become part of our daily lives and rituals, as they’re an easy way to get one’s fill of important vitamins to support their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this habit isn’t for no reason at all — multivitamins do provide a combination of essential vitamins and minerals to fill nutritional gaps when diet alone isn't enough, acting as "nutritional insurance" for overall health, energy, and immune support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top Supplements for Men's Health Over 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do these pills really make a difference — or are we all popping them for nothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve often asked this ourselves when we haven’t gotten visible results despite sticking to our routine. But no more — new research from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/multivitamins-improve-memory-and-slow-cognitive-aging" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; gives clearer, evidence-based answers. The findings of the research suggest that daily multivitamins are not a universal “health fix,” but they may offer real benefits in specific groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who all fall in those groups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the new research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recently published set of studies under the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS), researchers analyzed data from over 5,000 older adults and found evidence that a daily multivitamin may help slow cognitive aging and preserve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the COSMOS-Clinic subcohort — 573 participants who underwent detailed in-person cognitive assessments over two years — showed modest but statistically significant benefits in global cognition and episodic memory for those taking multivitamins compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combining results with two other arms of the trial (which used telephone- and web-based cognitive testing), the meta-analysis confirmed consistent benefits across all three studies. On average, daily multivitamin use was associated with a “slowing” of cognitive aging by around two years compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So what does that mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, older individuals who took a multivitamin performed slightly better on memory tests and had a slower decline in overall cognition over a period of 2–3 years compared to those taking a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts involved in the study note that the findings are “exciting,” suggesting a multivitamin could be an accessible, affordable way to support brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits the most from multivitamins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the new findings of the aforementioned study, multivitamins appear most useful for older adults, particularly those whose diets may be lacking or whose bodies might not absorb nutrients as efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/daily-multivitamin-may-improve-memory-in-older-adults/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;earlier trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 3,500 adults aged over 60 found memory improvements after a year of daily multivitamin use. The multivitamin effect was strongest among the participants with existing cardiovascular disease, which implied that underlying health conditions or nutritional deficits may make the supplement more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, experts suggest that in older age, factors like reduced absorption, less varied diet, or underlying health concerns may contribute to mild micronutrient deficiencies, which might make supplements even more useful than for younger, healthy adults eating balanced diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, multivitamins are likely to help when there’s a genuine need — primarily age-related or diet-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily, if you are 60 or older, or worried about memory or cognitive aging, especially if you don’t eat a very balanced diet, a daily multivitamin could offer small but meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, if your diet is already rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and essential nutrients, the added benefit of a multivitamin may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: think of multivitamins as a supplement instead of treating them as a substitute. Rather, focus first on diet quality, physical activity, mental stimulation, and overall healthy living. However, if you decide to take multivitamins, make sure to choose a well-balanced supplement (covering essential vitamins and minerals), and consult a healthcare professional beforehand — especially if you have existing health conditions or take other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>流感来得早，病例比去年增加了五倍-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/flu-comes-early-and-hits-hard-with-five-times-more-cases-than-last-year/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Amid a sharp rise in flu cases around the country that has seen &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/six-year-old-boy-dies-of-flu-complications-in-second-case-this-week/"&gt;three children die&lt;/a&gt; from complications of the disease, the Health Ministry’s Epidemic Control Team called an emergency meeting late Sunday night to discuss possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of the flu in Israel has started earlier this year, and is five times greater than during the same period last year, the Ynet news site reported, citing figures from Maccabi Healthcare Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, about 25 percent of PCR samples for respiratory viruses tested positive for Influenza A, compared to 5% last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The report said that in the week ending November 29, the Center for Disease Control recorded 394 new Influenza A cases in 14 hospitals. Children accounted for 163 of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, two babies were hospitalized in critical condition at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, with one being ventilated. At Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center, a toddler was also placed on a life-support system due to complications from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Flu comes early and hits hard, with five times more cases than last year"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The report also noted a steep rise in Influenza A among preschool-age children (ages 3 to 6) in November, with 59% of those tested for respiratory viruses found testing positive for that strain of the flu. Among school-age children (ages 6 to 18), about 50% of tests were positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Influenza A(H3N2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant subtype of this year’s influenza is A(H3N2). Infected people may experience symptoms such as fever, coughing, and sore throat, similar to those of other types of flu; however, A(H3N2) strains can lead to more severe respiratory problems and be fatal in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization reported that Influenza A continues to increase worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A woman gets her flu vaccine shot on September 5, 2023. (Clalit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, less than 15% of people in Israeli healthcare funds have been vaccinated against seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the children who died of the flu over the past two weeks had not received flu vaccinations, while one had received a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Prof. Ariel Tenenbaum, head of Hadassah’s pediatric department, urged people to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine will prevent children from being in a life-threatening condition,” Tenenbaum said.&lt;/p&gt;

It beats in rhythm with the world around us.” Here’s an exclusive interview:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this recognition from the American Heart Association mean to you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a great privilege, a very distinguished recognition of the work. To be selected amongst thousands of cardiologists every year is a unique privilege. I'm delighted, but equally delighted for what this means for the area of science that I'm involved in. It recognizes the work linked to science research, but also to translational research- the underpinning of whatever we do in cardiology. It's evidence-based. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The recognition is really an acknowledgment of the science that goes into decision making in the area of cardiology and a link between the work that I've done in the environment space.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;A lot of it is underpinned by the fact that we use research methodology to succumb to conclusions about the world around us, as well as the world within us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can you elaborate on the impact of environmental risk factors, specifically air pollution on cardiovascular diseases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is the second leading cause of global mortality right after hypertension which is the leading cause. It doesn't include any other environmental variable. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Just the math of this means that if you add together all the known knowns, and we know very little about environmental risk factors, then that's a part of it that really should be a clarion call for waking up, particularly in India, which is in the crosshairs of multiple environmental exposures.&lt;/span&gt; Air pollution is singularly the most important problem that we currently face and are going to face in the years to come. More than 60% of deaths attributable to air pollution are those that have led to cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When examined in that lens of why this is important for the subcontinent, it is a massive and a very important actionable area of health. Everyone’s entitled to good, clean air, clean water, and clean food. There should be an unmitigated attempt to curb exposure to air pollution, particularly in vulnerable communities, such as children. Early exposure during childhood causes permanent damage to your lung capacity or sets you up for future problems. Since it’s not a problem that individuals can solve alone, it's changes at policy and governmental level that are vital. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In light of the fact that this is such a humongous human tragedy, there needs to be a no-tolerance policy, and all hands on deck in terms of solving the problem.&lt;/span&gt; Also, air pollution costs India enormously. The economic ramifications in terms of sick days, hospitalisations and deaths are massive on a productivity frontier too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s your involvement at policy level?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I have helped position the US policy as part of the committee called the scientific advisory committee (SAC) and the Environmental Protection Agency, which formulates climate policy.&lt;/span&gt; I collaborate with researchers to try to come up with useful experiments or quasi-natural experiments that could inform or guide policy. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;I would be delighted to be engaged in any capacity with the Indian government, as I care deeply about the environment, particularly in parts of the world where policy actions or changes could have a significant impact on population health.&lt;/span&gt; The biggest point of convergence that shouldn't take any convincing for everybody is children's health. I hope that children's health is a rallying cry for people to unite in their opposition to anything detrimental to kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the most prevalent risk factors of CVD?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading cause of mortality and death worldwide is hypertension. Cardiovascular diseases have overtaken cancers as the leading cause of global mortality. One of the reasons for that is a growing epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. India, unfortunately, is the grand center for diabetes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is because of an incredible transition, both in terms of transitioning to nutrient heavy foods, changes in dietary patterns, changes in physical activity, densely populated cities that provide little room for recreation, lack of exercise, lack of education, and a profound shift and appetite, and the way people eat.&lt;/span&gt; It's just a massive problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US is no different. We are seeing a tsunami of obesity and diabetes. Smoking rates have gone down, but there's been an uptick in practices like vaping. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and elevation in LDL cholesterol, are driving heart disease globally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to reduce CVD and live long with a healthy heart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To stem or reduce cardiovascular disease prevalence, there needs to be paid to address not just the risk factors, but also primordial prevention- referring to an area where you don't allow these risk factors to begin in the first place.&lt;/span&gt; For example, to prevent the onset of hypertension or diabetes. And that really begins at the kindergarten level with education. It should be a huge priority from childhood. Also, educating families and how they feed their kids, what they consume in school and physical activity. You build good habits like physical exercises in school. It should be mandatory. People should understand that good food is about intelligent choices. Like a transition from eating a carbohydrate-rich diet to a protein rich diet. That should be the real focus because in the long run, that's the most cost effective way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association has a big push on primordial prevention. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you sleep well, do good physical activity, don't smoke, control hypertension, eat a good diet and are not obese- that should give you a fairly good lifespan and healthspan.&lt;/span&gt; It’s a good recipe for longevity in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Any next generation therapies for CVD and any innovative approaches for imaging.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;We are at a very interesting crossroads in medicine- at a confluence of artificial intelligence and genetic technologies, which are really going to redefine the era of medicine.&lt;/span&gt; Diseases that would have, essentially, relegated you to premature death, with no options are now becoming curable. There are some cardiac conditions, like amyloidosis that can now be completely solved. But these are expensive treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a larger population perspective, the previous century practices work best like eating less, walking more, and eating more plant based foods. I would say, these are the three fundamental requisites for good cardiovascular health. Prevent yourself from getting to be a diabetic, obese, and hypertensive. These are all connected risk factors that can be solved by healthy dietary practices and exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done to offset the genetic predisposition that South Asians face?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetically speaking we are all the same. The genome is 99.5% or more similar. What's different is the genetic environment interactions-meaning the epigenomic responses or the responses to environmental triggers. For instance, if a South Asian is exposed to a high fat diet, they respond very differently than somebody in Europe or China. This is the epigenomic framework, where genes are expressed differently based on the environment you are placed in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anything that you might like to add on the young people, getting more cardiovascular diseases than was earlier seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s very tragic and not based on traditional risk factors. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And this is where I think there should be a lot of attention on setting up a large registry of such patients where we are able to collect tissue samples, bio-bank specimens, and a very detailed history on patients.&lt;/span&gt; I believe that environmental exposures of these patients might be very important. What might be singularly different about these patients might be an increase in environmental exposures. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;There are many parts of India, as well as in North America, that have high exposure to lead, cadmium, arsenic, and other toxic metals, as well as chemicals and large amounts of plastic, which are ubiquitous and all around you.&lt;/span&gt; This is compounded by profound, high levels of air pollution. In conjunction with other risk factors, this can be very dangerous. It's a huge problem, very unbelievably disturbing. When you're at the peak of your livelihood, it’s medically and economically catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The duvet is pulled neatly into place, the pillows are arranged with care, and the perfectly made bed becomes a symbol of order and discipline. Across generations, this simple act has been encouraged as a marker of responsibility, productivity, and self-control. From military training to parenting advice and bestselling self-help books, making the bed has been framed as a small but meaningful accomplishment that sets the tone for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, emerging research suggests that this universally accepted habit may be hiding an unexpected drawback. While it appears harmless and even beneficial, it could be creating conditions that quietly undermine your respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

With more people spending extended time at home, conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinus issues are increasingly being linked to pollutants and allergens inside the home. Bedrooms, where people spend roughly a third of their lives, are especially important in this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the traditional practice of making the bed every morning takes an unexpected turn. A growing body of scientific evidence highlights how tightly made bedding may be fostering an environment ideal for dust mite survival. A widely discussed study conducted at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/about/news/messy-bedroom-could-spell-end-for-creepy-crawlies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kingston University in the United Kingdom &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;revealed that leaving your bed unmade during the day could significantly reduce dust mite populations. Led by environmental building scientist Dr Stephen Pretlove, the research examined how heat and moisture trapped in bedding influence dust mite growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A freshly made bed traps the warmth and humidity generated during sleep. These conditions allow dust mites, which feed on dead skin cells, to thrive. When the bed is left unmade, with sheets exposed to airflow and natural evaporation, moisture levels fall and the microclimate becomes less favourable for mite survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Pretlove noted, allowing a bed to remain open during the day helps moisture evaporate from the mattress and bedding materials. This creates an environment that disrupts dust mite activity and reduces their ability to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why dust mites pose a serious health concern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dust mites are among the most common indoor allergens worldwide. Although invisible to the naked eye, their waste particles can trigger a variety of allergic reactions. Symptoms may range from mild nasal irritation and sneezing to more significant respiratory issues, particularly in people with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/dust-mites" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, bedding and pillows are some of the most concentrated sources of dust mite allergens in the home. An average bed may host up to 1.5 million mites, creating a continual source of allergen exposure night after night. Reducing dust mite levels is therefore crucial for households with asthma sufferers, young children, older adults, or individuals with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden link between bed-making habits and dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that a tidy bed equates to a cleaner sleeping environment. In reality, the opposite may be true. When you sleep, your body releases moisture through sweat and respiration. The average adult emits roughly one litre of fluid each night. If you immediately make the bed in the morning, this moisture becomes trapped under layers of sheets, blankets, and duvets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With limited ventilation, particularly during colder months when windows remain closed, this trapped moisture creates a warm and humid microclimate ideal for dust mite survival and reproduction. Indoor heating systems further complicate the issue by drying the air outside the bedding while leaving the inside warm and insulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies, including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasise the importance of reducing humidity and improving airflow to control indoor allergens. However, few people consider how their bed-making routine influences these environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bed-making tips that help control dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts do not suggest abandoning cleanliness or household routines. Instead, they recommend a more thoughtful approach to bed-making. Rather than immediately arranging your bedding after waking, allow the sheets and mattress to air out for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull back the duvet, open the windows if possible, and leave the bed exposed to moving air. This helps disperse moisture, lowers humidity, and reduces the hospitable environment that dust mites rely on. Of course, this practice should complement other hygienic habits such as washing bedding every one to two weeks in hot water, vacuuming the mattress regularly, and using dust-mite-resistant covers on pillows and mattresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing importance of indoor air quality in multi use bedrooms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern lifestyles have blurred the boundaries between living, working, and sleeping spaces. With more people using bedrooms for multiple activities, the quality of the indoor environment matters more than ever. Allowing your bed to breathe is a low-cost, practical step that can improve air quality and reduce allergen levels. It is not about rejecting cleanliness but about adapting an old habit to align with new scientific understanding. The tradition of making the bed every morning has been deeply ingrained for generations. Yet as research continues to highlight the importance of indoor air quality, small adjustments to this habit could have meaningful benefits for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bed unmade for a few hours allows natural airflow to do what it does best. It dries the bedding, disrupts the activity of dust mites, and creates a healthier sleeping environment. By rethinking this everyday ritual, you may be reducing an invisible risk that has quietly affected millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬对毛毯的热爱是您从未见过的- DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/198488-golden-retriever-blanket-video</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs love every little thing they own. Once they fall in love with something, there is no way they would ever leave it. The same can be seen in this clip shared by a dog owner. Here, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Trooper is seen wagging his tail with delight at the sight of his favorite blanket. The hilarious video left viewers in splits, and people commented on how cute the dog is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-loves-his-blankie-a-bit-too-much-in-adorable-video"&gt;Golden Retriever loves his blankie a bit too much in adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think dogs love only their toys, think again, as this specific video proves otherwise. In a video shared by @trooperatdavidcorrycars, Trooper the Golden Retriever can’t contain his excitement when he sees his favorite blankie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video begins with Trooper heading toward a room, wagging his tail enthusiastically. He gets happier as his human wraps a blanket around him. The fur baby then grabs a toy and snuggles into the blanket, happily playing with it. A hilarious moment shows him entering a room with his eyes covered by the blanket and bonking his head on the wall. Even as the ladies pet him, he refuses to &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/191062-doberman-blankie-dog-instagram-video"&gt;leave his blanket&lt;/a&gt; for a second. His constantly wagging tail perfectly shows how happy he is with his favorite thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post’s caption jokingly talks about the little head bump the dog had, stating, “Might have to take a trip to the service department for that head bump”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video left viewers amused, and many shared their heartfelt reactions in the comments. Most viewers talked about how the dog bonked his head on the wall, with one saying, “I almost heard the little whoops as he bonked the wall”. Meanwhile, others couldn’t stop praising the dog’s fun antics, calling him “cute” and “adorable” as his tail wagged nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Their work proposes that chronic stress and many widespread health concerns stem from a fundamental mismatch between our nature-shaped physiology and the highly industrialized environments most people live in today.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, humans evolved to meet the physical and psychological demands of hunter-gatherer life, which required frequent movement, short bursts of intense stress and daily exposure to natural settings. Industrialization has altered these conditions within only a few centuries by adding noise, air and light pollution, microplastics, pesticides, continuous sensory input, artificial lighting, processed foods and long periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our ancestral environments, we were well adapted to deal with acute stress to evade or confront predators," says Colin Shaw, who leads the Human Evolutionary EcoPhysiology (HEEP) research group with Daniel Longman. "The lion would come around occasionally, and you had to be ready to defend yourself -- or run. The key is that the lion goes away again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern stressors such as traffic, workplace pressure, social media and persistent noise activate the same biological pathways that once helped humans survive predators. Unlike the rapid resolution our ancestors experienced, these stressors rarely subside. "Our body reacts as though all these stressors were lions," Longman explains. "Whether it's a difficult discussion with your boss or traffic noise, your stress response system is still the same as if you were facing lion after lion. As a result, you have a very powerful response from your nervous system, but no recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrialization and Its Impact on Health and Reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their review, Shaw and Longman evaluate research suggesting that the shift toward industrial and urban living is reducing human evolutionary fitness. Evolutionary success depends on both survival and reproduction, and the authors argue that both have been negatively influenced since industrialization began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They highlight falling fertility rates across much of the world and increasing rates of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as evidence that modern environments are placing stress on human biology. "There's a paradox where, on the one hand, we've created tremendous wealth, comfort and healthcare for a lot of people on the planet," Shaw says, "but on the other hand, some of these industrial achievements are having detrimental effects on our immune, cognitive, physical and reproductive functions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most studied examples is the steady decline in sperm count and sperm motility observed since the 1950s. Shaw notes that these trends appear to be linked to environmental exposures. "This is believed to be tied to pesticides and herbicides in food, but also to microplastics," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for Solutions That Support Human Wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological and environmental conditions continue to change far more rapidly than biological evolution can respond to. "Biological adaptation is very slow. Longer-term genetic adaptations are multigenerational -- tens to hundreds of thousands of years," Shaw says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this means the mismatch between human physiology and modern living conditions will not correct itself through natural evolutionary processes. Instead, they argue that societies must take active steps to reduce these pressures by strengthening connections to nature and creating healthier, more sustainable environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing this mismatch requires both cultural and environmental changes. Shaw suggests treating nature as a crucial component of public health and protecting or restoring landscapes that resemble those in which humans originally evolved. He also advocates for rethinking city design to better align with human physiology and reduce harmful exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research can identify which stimuli most affect blood pressure, heart rate or immune function, for example, and pass that knowledge on to decision-makers," Shaw says. "We need to get our cities right -- and at the same time regenerate, value and spend more time in natural spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Photo: Kajsa Göransson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph--text-image__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” says &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/people/torkel-klingberg" data-entity-type="external"&gt;Torkel Klingberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/neuro" data-entity-type="external"&gt;Department of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, Karolinska Institutet. “Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Significance at population level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was not influenced by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards ADHD. Additionally, children who already had symptoms of inattentiveness did not start to use social media more, which suggests that the association leads from use to symptoms and not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no increase in hyperactive/impulsive behaviour. The effect on concentration was small at the individual level. At a population level, however, it could have a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” says Professor Klingberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Well-informed decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that the results do not imply that all children who use social media develop concentration difficulties, but there is reason to discuss age limits and platform design. In the study, the average time spent on social media rose from approximately 30 minutes a day for 9-year-olds to 2.5 hours for 13-year-olds, despite the fact that many platforms set their minimum age requirement at 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Karolinska Institutet</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:05:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=""

the world, could lead to the world's next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The death also comes as bird flu was detected in an Australian external territory for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;European health authorities warned this month that governments should step up efforts to combat bird flu threats amid an "unprecedented" number of outbreaks in the northern hemisphere's autumn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since September, more than 1,400 infections among wild birds and poultry have been detected in at least 26 European countries, four times higher than a year ago and the highest level since 2016, raising the risk that the virus could spill over into people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some forms of bird flu, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a

infections are rare and typically occur in cases who have been in close contact with sick birds and livestock. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some experts say it's becoming more likely that the bird flu virus could become the next pandemic, while others agree its possible but say the probability is "very low". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;What do we know about bird flu pathogens?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from the University of South Australia, said H5N5, like the first strain detected in humans in Hong Kong in 1997, H5N1, was highly infectious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The one that's really causing worry at the moment is the H5N1, which is going around the world, not only killing off millions of wild birds and domestic birds, but it's also affecting mammals all around the world," he told SBS News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These are all what we call highly pathogenic avian flu, basically, there's two types of bird flu, there's bird flu, which is quite mild and basically doesn't kill off the wild birds, which is called low pathogenic avian flu, then there's highly pathogenic, and both H5N5 and H5N1 are highly pathogenic," Esterman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the early Hong Kong human transmission cases, there have been more than a dozen strains, with cases flaring in different parts of the world at different times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are almost 1,000 recorded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiLink-root

being transmitted to humans, with at least 476 human deaths recorded since 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 11 deaths from bird flu between January and August; these were in Cambodia, India and Mexico.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;A changing virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said like the coronavirus, the avian flu virus continued to morph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The H and the N stand for proteins that spike out from the flu," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What happens is, every year they tend to change a little bit, and every few years they have a major change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outbreaks of other strains, including H7 subtypes, have occurred on poultry farms in some eastern states in recent years and have been eradicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists came across H5N5 in animals around 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div

variant poses, but Esterman said the fact that H5N1 had such a high mortality rate for humans, about 48 per cent, meant any spread of avian flu variants to humans was "a big worry".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In November, the federal government confirmed the H5N1 strain had been detected for the first time on remote Heard Island, 4,000km south-west of Perth and 1,700km north of Antarctica.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;How humans catch bird flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the recent cases of bird flu have been in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said bird flu had been passed on from animals to humans through physical contact with the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the virus is also in wild birds, humans most often catch it from either domestic birds or from cattle and dairy cows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Usually it's a dead animal, and you know, they'll touch a dead animal, but I suppose they can pick it up from just droppings on the ground," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said most of the people who contracted the virus either worked in the dairy or poultry industries or were associated with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said while it was possible for the virus to be passed from human to human, there was little to no evidence of its spread that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;div itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="8"

data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;Avian flu could arrive in Australia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cassandra Berry, a professor of immunology at Murdoch University, said the eventual arrival of H5 variants of bird flu into Australia was inevitable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are now surrounded by the virus," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Australia and Antarctica were the only continents free of bird flu in the world, but that changed a few years ago, with virus outbreaks being observed in Antarctica and surrounding islands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Even the expedition leaders on my recent trip to the Antarctic peninsula earlier this year remarked on the low sightings of crab-eater seals and skuas, likely decimated by a highly pathogenic bird flu strain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Berry said if the virus jumped into animal species in Australia, culling and ring vaccination, in which populations of animals surrounding the confirmed cases were vaccinated, would be the preferred control measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"However, neighbouring countries have been mass vaccinating their poultry to protect flocks, industry and food supply," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In the meantime, virus surveillance is the key biosecurity measure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;The next potential pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Berry, Griffin and Esterman all agreed there was potential for the bird flu to become a pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A pandemic is always on the cards," Berry said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said one reason the H5 strains pose such a risk to humans is that "it's got such a high mortality rate".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"All the people who've been infected with the H5N1 strain over the last 20 years, half of them have died, so it's nasty," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Griffin said while there were a lot of variables to consider, if bird flu started spreading between humans, he estimated it'd take just days to "really spread all around the world".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said the fact "we're not seeing very many human cases, and seeing very rare, if any, human-to-human spread of these, so at the moment," was reassuring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, he said a growing number of bird species and other animals were becoming affected and the virus was increasing its geographical spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So it has the makings for a potentially significant situation, if that ability to be transmitted to and between humans increases," Griffin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said monitoring animal populations was vital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We need to be monitoring for the potential changes that might give these flus the ability to be more transmissible in humans, and we need to, you know, make sure that surveillance continues, but also that we're preparing for if it does make its way into humans, for how we'd respond to that," Griffin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said while there was a vaccine for H5N1, there was not currently a vaccine for H5N5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"With vaccine technology more broadly, we are in a fortunate position that we can adapt our vaccines potentially more quickly, but flu vaccines and the traditional platform do take quite a bit of time to manufacture," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gregorio Torres, head of the Science Department at the World Organisation for Animal Health, told the Reuters news agency the risk of a human pandemic developing from the bird flu virus remains low,.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We need to be prepared to respond early enough. But for the time being, you can happily walk in the forest, eat chicken and eggs and enjoy your life," he said. "The pandemic risk is a possibility. But in terms of probability, it's still very low."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government committed an additional $95 million to both protecting Australia from and preparing the country for the outbreak of bird flu in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The funding has gone towards strengthening national biosecurity response capability, surveillance and public health preparedness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SBS Australia</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 03:07:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPei1qSnY1ODJxck1RUm5JSDRkOTh6TWtZQWI2eXVSZy10OVhZUHM3VVFTVVBMVmdhbDR5VUJBejBnN2xxUHdoZS0wOGIwd2JkZUNzZGxoQUcycFBwVHN3T01XS0pfcElmeE9lX2RlZ0FCOG9TY2lIc0k3TVRzV2NwaUdfcFR4VXRKMTh3Mko5ejFyZ2RFLVRZ</guid></item><item><title>降低血压：这种简单的睡前习惯可以帮助改善心脏健康和整体健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lower-your-blood-pressure-this-simple-bedtime-habit-could-help-improve-heart-health-and-overall-wellness/articleshow/125813687.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects nearly half of adults in the United States and increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious cardiovascular problems. While medications, a healthy diet, and regular exercise are commonly recommended to manage blood pressure, recent research highlights the importance of sleep timing. Going to bed at the same time every night can help regulate the body’s internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, which controls sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. A consistent bedtime supports the natural nightly dip in blood pressure, reduces stress on the heart, and can even enhance the effectiveness of existing hypertension treatments. Maintaining this simple habit is an easy and low-cost strategy for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding blood pressure and why it matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries and is recorded as two numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diastolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries between heartbeats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure is considered below 120/80 mmHg. Readings above 130/80 mmHg indicate hypertension, and readings above 180/120 mmHg require urgent medical attention. Hypertension often develops without symptoms, making it essential to monitor regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of circadian rhythm in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian rhythm is the body’s internal clock, which regulates sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. Blood pressure naturally dips during sleep: a process called nocturnal dipping. Disruptions to sleep patterns, such as going to bed at inconsistent times, can interfere with this natural dip and contribute to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sustained high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of diabetes and obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher chances of heart attacks and strokes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a regular bedtime strengthens the circadian rhythm, helping the body regulate blood pressure more effectively. A study by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/6/4/zpaf082/8325210" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; monitored 11 middle-aged adults over one week on their usual sleep schedule and two weeks with a fixed bedtime.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating lots of added sugar at night can make it harder to fall and stay asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar spikes before bed can mess with hormones that help your body get sleepy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose snacks with protein, fiber and healthy fats to keep blood sugar steady for better sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most Americans already consume &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291176/what-happens-when-you-consume-too-much-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;too much added sugar&lt;/a&gt;—to the tune of about 17 teaspoons per day—which is linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and poor sleep.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When foods high in added sugar are eaten close to bedtime, they can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, making it harder to fall and stay asleep. Not all sugar is created equal, though. “Naturally occurring sugars are found in whole foods that also provide fiber, vitamins and minerals, while added sugars are often found in more refined, ultra-processed foods,” says&lt;a href="https://wellnessbyval.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Val Warner, M.S., RD, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “Consuming too much added sugar is what’s linked to negative health outcomes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand how eating sugar in the evening affects sleep—and what to reach for instead—we spoke with registered dietitians to break down the science and share practical tips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-sugar-can-impact-your-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Sugar Can Impact Your Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat foods high in added sugar—like candy or baked goods—your blood sugar rises and your body releases insulin to move that glucose into your cells for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That process is completely normal. But when blood sugar rises sharply, particularly in the evening, it can throw off the delicate balance of hormones that help regulate your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep-wake cycle&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High amounts of added sugar can cause a rapid spike in blood glucose, triggering the release of insulin to bring levels back down,” explains Warner. If levels drop quickly afterward, your body may release hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to bring them back up—leaving you feeling alert when you’d rather be asleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When cortisol stays high at night, it can delay the natural rise in melatonin that signals your body it’s time to sleep,” says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. This mismatch between cortisol and melatonin can make it more difficult to relax and fall asleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These blood-sugar fluctuations can also affect how deeply and how long you sleep. Studies show that diets high in added sugar are linked to shorter sleep duration and more frequent nighttime awakenings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rapid rises and dips in glucose may also disrupt REM sleep—the stage that supports memory, learning and emotional regulation—and reduce time spent in deep, restorative sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why your evening sweet tooth can sometimes lead to a night of tossing and turning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-8-pm-be-the-cutoff-time-for-added-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Should 8 P.M. Be the “Cutoff Time” for Added Sugar?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s nothing magical about the clock striking 8 p.m., the timing of your last meal or snack can influence how your body handles sugar—and how well you sleep afterward. Our metabolism follows a circadian rhythm, meaning that we process and use energy differently at different times of day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Timing matters when it comes to thinking about your sugar intake,” says &lt;a href="http://themetabolicdietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny Finke, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. As the day winds down, digestion slows and insulin sensitivity decreases, making it harder for the body to manage large amounts of sugar.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Ideally, the last meal of the day is eaten two to three hours before bed, as this allows time for digestion and processing of the sugars or carbohydrates present in the meal,” Finke adds. “This spacing supports steadier blood sugar as melatonin levels rise, and it helps support optimal sleep quality,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, there’s no one-size-fits-all “sugar curfew.” The key is to tune in to your body’s cues—if you tend to feel wired or wake frequently after a nighttime dessert, it may help to enjoy it earlier in the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-dietitians-say-to-eat-instead"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Dietitians Say to Eat Instead &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re truly hungry before bed, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-dont-eat-11814208" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping food&lt;/a&gt; altogether isn’t the answer—going to sleep hungry can make it harder to drift off and stay asleep. Instead, Warner recommends a snack that combines protein, healthy fats, fiber and complex carbohydrates to help keep blood sugar steady. This balance helps slow digestion and prevents the sharp rises and dips that can interfere with deep, restorative sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finke recommends our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252837/nut-berry-parfait/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nut &amp;amp; Berry Parfait&lt;/a&gt; for a mix of protein, fiber and healthy fats. She suggests swapping the berries for frozen tart cherries, as they are associated with improved sleep quality and duration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians also recommend our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; as a fiber- and protein-rich option that can help keep blood sugar steady and support better sleep. Chia seeds also provide magnesium and calcium, nutrients that play a role in converting tryptophan to serotonin, a precursor to melatonin. Make it with dairy milk or a calcium-fortified nondairy milk, then top with fruit and nuts for a balanced combination of carbs, healthy fats and sleep-supporting nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s less about cutting out sweets entirely and more about how you enjoy them. “It’s all about pairing the right foods, not about restriction,” Warner encourages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to avoid dessert altogether for better sleep. Thankfully, it’s less about cutting out sweets entirely and more about how you enjoy them. If you want something sweet before bed, opt for foods that contain naturally occurring sugars and enjoy them with foods that contain fiber, protein and healthy fats. Balanced snacks that support stable blood sugar also help you sleep better. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple watches, Garmin watches, Fitbit watches, the Strava app … there are endless ways to track miles walked, calories burned, and steps taken. Not only that, but there’s been a big push to track those measures every time — and it may be hurting your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The obsession with self-tracking of health metrics with wearables can increase anxiety and cause you to ignore what your body is telling you,” said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/michael-swartzon/869766" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Swartzon&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine physician at Baptist Health Orthopedic Care. “The raw data can lead to emotional stress when your body is just going through normal biological variations, probably the opposite of your goal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://freespira.com/leadership_team/robert-cuyler-ph-d/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robert Cuyler&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral health expert, whether health tracking is “healthy” is about when and how much you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The availability of tech-mediated health data is interesting and useful for those who use these tools (smartwatches, rings, etc.) in moderation and for specific purposes, with some guidance by evidence,” he said. “However, health tracking ... can become excessive, fueling bodily hypervigilance and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Swartzon encouraged people to focus on the basics: fitting some physical exercise into their day, eating a wide variety of foods, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and listening to their body. All that other data isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Ashley, 35, told the outlet she made sure Tori got plenty of rest and continued to monitor her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Tori's fever broke after a few days, Ashley believed she was on the mend. "Then suddenly, she started complaining of intense pain in both legs," the mom recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pain began in Tori's thighs before moving down to her calves. As she was still recovering from the flu, Ashley assumed the leg pain was "just normal soreness" from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother taking a child's temperature (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But soon, the pain became so intense that Tori complained of being unable to stand, saying "her legs felt too weak to support her," Ashley told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She took Tori to a walk-in clinic, but doctors “didn’t seem concerned" and advised Ashley to take her daughter home and allow her to continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next morning, however, Tori attempted to get out of bed and "took one step and dropped straight to the ground because the pain was so unbearable when she put pressure on her feet," her mom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That was the moment I knew this was something serious,” Ashley recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Child in hospital (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashley took Tori to the emergency room, where she underwent testing, including bloodwork and a urinalysis. Tori was then diagnosed with benign acute childhood myositis (BACM), a rare disease that is "characterized by localized muscular pain (especially in the calves) that typically follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection," according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12454055/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The illness typically lasts for a brief period of time, usually up to 1 week," the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250949/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; said, noting, "Since many clinicians are unfamiliar with BACM, it is often misdiagnosed and interpreted as a more severe and complex disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Tori's case, the 9-year-old fully recovered — and was able to walk normally again — after a week in the hospital, where she was closely monitored and administered IV fluids and pain medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But her mom told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that her daughter's BACM diagnosis came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This completely caught me off guard," she said. "I had never even heard of this kind of complication from the flu before. It was scary and very unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, Ashley is warning other parents about the rare complication. In a now-viral &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashleygeuther/video/7556258488939253047" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on her TikTok account, she shared a clip of Tori walking on her toes around her hospital room while holding onto a wheeled cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"As flu season begins, please remember to listen to your kids and watch closely for complications," she wrote in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashley then detailed what led to Tori's diagnosis and hospital stay, before concluding: "Thankfully, after a week, she made a full recovery and was able to walk again. I'm sharing our story so other parents can know what to watch for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;, Ashley added, “Listen to your kids when they say something hurts, even if it seems unusual.

    &lt;p&gt;When people think of gym goers using steroids, the picture that comes to mind is often of a man &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"&gt;pumping iron, like Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, or modern day shirtless masculinity &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/from-the-liver-king-to-ultramarathons-fitness-influencers-are-glorifying-extreme-masculinity-where-pain-is-the-point-256817"&gt;influencers like “the Liver King”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the image is changing. Women now represent a growing share of people who use steroids. And so harm minimisation efforts, currently targeted at men, will need to change too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DL3GLMAxuMG","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows women are increasingly represented among steroid-using communities, even though precise long-term trend data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;2024 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of international studies found about 4% of adult women had used anabolic steroids at least once, up from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.01.009"&gt;1.6% in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2024/08/28/risks-faced-by-women-using-anabolic-steroids-in-australia"&gt;Among women bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 17% – around one in six – report using steroids, and rates among women in strength sports or recreational lifting communities are also markedly higher than in the general woman population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging evidence suggests the gender profile of steroid use is shifting, even if precise historical rates are not available to confirm the exact scale of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we don’t have robust national statistics for Australia, data show &lt;a href="https://www.acic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-10/illicit_drug_data_report_2020-21_forweb.pdf"&gt;the weight of steroids seized nationally&lt;/a&gt; increased 1,372% between 2011-12 and 2020-21 (from 33.7 kilograms to 496.8kg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend almost &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;certainly mirrors what’s happening overseas&lt;/a&gt;: continued, escalating growth of the bodybuilding and fitness communities, including among women in amateur strength sports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boom in women’s &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-03/women-weightlifting-no-longer-invisible-empowering-women-all-age/105945008"&gt;strength training and weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; since 2021 will benefit the physical and mental health of most who partake in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the simultaneous increase in steroid use may be cause for concern without effective harm reduction via education, health promotion and health services engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="TiktokEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@larrywheels/video/7389447108404776234"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3 reasons more women are using them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex but three stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/physical-activity/strengthening-activities-among-australian-adults/contents/summary"&gt;the rise of strength sports&lt;/a&gt;. Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666337625000162"&gt;participation in powerlifting, weightlifting and bodybuilding has grown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/women-strength-training-shredded-at-gym-for-health/103376798"&gt;rapidly in Australia &lt;/a&gt;since the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sports have opened up new spaces for women to feel strong, confident and physically capable. But they also expose women to online communities where performance-enhancing drugs are normalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Second, the influence of social media. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are filled with “fitfluencers” showcasing dramatic transformations. Many of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;women are seeking the “perfect body”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some openly promote steroid cycles and other chemical shortcuts. Women who follow these influencers – often for training or nutrition advice – can end up in online spaces where performance-enhancing drugs are normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;

      &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/get-big-or-die-trying-social-media-is-driving-mens-use-of-steroids-heres-how-to-mitigate-the-risks-253110"&gt;Get big or die trying: social media is driving men's use of steroids. Here's how to mitigate the risks&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Third, many women are being encouraged or “brought into” performance-enhancing drugs use by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research from Australia and Scandinavia shows women often start using steroids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395920302164?via%3Dihub"&gt;through male friends, partners or coaches&lt;/a&gt;, who may position these drugs as necessary for progress or competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, taking any performance- or image-enhancing drug is not without risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The dangers are real&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While steroids carry risks for everyone, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6371806/"&gt;women may face unique and irreversible side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102876"&gt;These include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facial and body hair growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deepening of the voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;menstrual changes or infertility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breast tissue reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acne and hair loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clitoral enlargement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;severe mood changes, including anxiety and irritability, among other symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond these risks, emerging Australian research shows another danger: many underground steroid products &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/pumped-up-with-poison-new-research-shows-many-anabolic-steroids-contain-toxic-metals-261470"&gt;contain toxic contaminants&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.70007"&gt;such as lead, arsenic and cadmium&lt;/a&gt; – substances linked to cancer, organ damage and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest long-term risks are the ones people rarely talk about: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797160/"&gt;heart disease, stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2025.2460986"&gt;liver damage&lt;/a&gt; and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with women who use steroids show many are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0091450924125600"&gt;less informed than men about these dangers&lt;/a&gt;, often because the research has historically focused on male use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of stigma. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;Women report&lt;/a&gt; being judged more harshly than men when seeking medical help and some avoid health services entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves them more vulnerable to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do we turn this trend around?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policing steroid use in isolation won’t work. Nor will repeating the old message that women should simply “just say no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests three promising approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better health promotion education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that actually speaks to women. Most steroid information online is written for men, by men. Health agencies need to produce clear, accessible, women’s resources &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci9040055"&gt;that explain risks honestly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;without shame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/28355245.2024.2350155"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Meeting women where they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Social media is where many women learn about these drugs, so it should also be where they see accurate information. This may include partnering with credible fitness influencers – especially women – who can explain risks, promote safer training practices and counter misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reducing stigma in healthcare.&lt;/strong&gt; Women who use steroids may avoid doctors because they fear judgement. Training clinicians to respond without moralising – the same way we approach other drug-related issues – would make it easier for women to seek support early.&lt;/p&gt;

While medications are never a substitute for having healthy diet and lifestyle habits in place, scientific studies have shown just how powerful blood pressure-lowering medications can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10857895/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2024 scientific study published in Cureus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2024 scientific study published in &lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, taking a blood pressure-lowering medication significantly reduced high blood pressure in elderly adults with hypertension, which in turn reduced their risk of cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/commonly-missed-early-heart-attack-sign-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-stroke-symptoms-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any other medication, it’s important to know how certain foods and drinks can interact with blood pressure medications. That way, you can ensure you get the maximum benefit from the medication while staying safe. With this in mind, there’s one drink combo that a pharmacist says most people don’t realize can negatively interact with blood pressure medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Prasit photo&amp;amp;sol;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Drink Combo To Avoid if You’re Taking Medication for High Blood Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common to reach for an energy drink when feeling fatigued, but if you’re taking medication for high blood pressure, you may want to avoid it—especially if you like to combine it with a sugary drink, like grape juice. It's a surprisingly common combination, and &lt;a href="https://drinkghost.com/products/ghost%C2%AE-energy-x-welchs%C2%AE-grape?srsltid=AfmBOop5RTfibg_xex1jVAByM_0Riac-eAYYnb2Dzt1b0PhRMnXWvWNZ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Welch's Grape Juice even has its own energy drink;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Welch's Grape Juice even has its own energy drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/pharmacy-and-pharmaceutical-sciences/academics/departments/pharmacy-practice/profile.html?id=twarner1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Taylor Clark, PharmD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Taylor Clark, PharmD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a clinical assistant professor of pharmacy practice at Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Studies, explains that high-caffeine drinks can raise blood pressure. She shares that &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/why-you-should-avoid-coffee-if-you-have-this-medical-condition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; increases blood pressure by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system and releasing catecholamines, which are molecules that act as neurotransmitters and hormones (AKA chemical messengers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-lowered-my-high-blood-pressure-here-is-how-i-did-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I Had Sky-High Blood Pressure for Years, Now It's 112/72—Here's What I Did';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I Had Sky-High Blood Pressure for Years, Now It's 112/72—Here's What I Did'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may directly negate the effects of blood pressure-lowering medications. Because of this, it is recommended that patients with hypertension limit caffeine consumption. The&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2025 hypertension guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2025 hypertension guidelines&lt;/a&gt; suggest consuming less than 300 milligrams of caffeine per day, and in patients with severe, uncontrolled hypertension, anything greater than one caffeinated beverage per day should be avoided,” Dr. Clark says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you combine a high-caffeinated drink with a drink high in sugar (like soda or fruit juice) the impact can be even worse. This is because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24630785/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sugary drinks are scientifically linked to raising blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sugary drinks are scientifically linked to raising blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

If you’re taking a blood pressure-lowering medication, you may be wondering what a safer way to boost your energy is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do want to have an energy drink, Dr. Clark suggests first checking the label and making sure the caffeine content isn't greater than 300 milligrams, which would be unsafe. But you can absolutely still have &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1354797/elizabethnarins/types-of-coffee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;: One cup of coffee typically has about 95 milligrams of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have uncontrolled hypertension, Dr. Clark says to keep coffee consumption to one cup a day, keeping in line with the 2025 hypertension guidelines previously mentioned. She points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36542728/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing that participants with hypertension who had two to three cups of coffee a day had a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Habit That Can Lower Your Blood Pressure Overnight, According to a Cardiologist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Habit That Can Lower Your Blood Pressure Overnight, According to a Cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/green-tea-vs-coffee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Green tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt; is a safer bet when it comes to enjoying a caffeinated drink if you have hypertension.

These traditional methods, although widely used, can cause minor pain, skin irritation, or bruising, and their frequency can reduce adherence. Advances in optical sensing technologies are now offering alternatives that allow you to monitor glucose continuously without breaking the skin. One particularly promising technique is band-pass Raman spectroscopy, which captures the unique vibrational signatures of glucose molecules in the skin and underlying tissue. By translating these molecular fingerprints into continuous readings, this approach could improve accuracy, reduce discomfort, and offer detailed insights into daily glucose fluctuations, allowing you to manage your health more precisely. The method also has the potential to integrate into compact, wearable devices, offering convenience while maintaining clinical reliability and patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How band-pass Raman spectroscopy detects glucose in your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Band-pass Raman spectroscopy relies on the interaction of light with molecules to identify glucose in the skin and tissue. When a focused laser beam illuminates the skin, most photons scatter without change, but a small fraction interacts with molecules, causing a shift in energy that produces a Raman spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each type of molecule has a distinctive spectral signature, and glucose produces identifiable peaks that can be isolated from signals of proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules. Band-pass optical filters allow the device to focus on the spectral range where glucose signals are strongest, reducing background interference. These signals are then analysed by advanced computational algorithms, which convert the spectral information into glucose concentrations continuously. Because the technique is non-invasive, it allows repeated measurements without puncturing the skin, providing consistent monitoring throughout the day. The approach also lends itself to compact, portable designs, making it suitable for wearable devices that integrate seamlessly into your lifestyle while providing clinically relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What research says about painless, continuous glucose tracking&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c01146" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Analytical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the feasibility of using band-pass Raman spectroscopy for continuous glucose monitoring with a compact, point-of-care device. Researchers demonstrated that the system could reliably detect glucose concentrations with accuracy comparable to standard finger-prick methods. The study highlighted the importance of device calibration, signal processing, and precise optical alignment to ensure reliable readings. The compact design was particularly suitable for use both in clinical settings and in home environments, enabling continuous monitoring without the discomfort of repeated blood sampling. Findings indicated that non-invasive monitoring could reduce both the physical and psychological burden of conventional methods while providing a more comprehensive understanding of glucose dynamics. Continuous monitoring allows identification of trends that might otherwise be missed with intermittent sampling, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits of tracking blood sugar without needles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive glucose monitoring offers clear advantages compared with traditional sampling. Eliminating repeated skin punctures reduces pain, bruising, and the risk of infection. Continuous data provide a dynamic view of glucose fluctuations, allowing you to respond quickly to rising or falling levels. Integration with wearable devices enables real-time data transmission to smartphones or healthcare providers, supporting remote monitoring and personalised care. Because measurements are automated, the method reduces errors associated with sample handling, timing, or technique, improving overall reliability. The approach also allows for long-term tracking, giving both patients and clinicians a richer dataset for informed decision-making regarding diet, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key advantages include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of finger-prick testing and associated discomfort or skin irritation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time continuous monitoring of glucose fluctuations throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced risk of skin infections or minor injuries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with wearable technology for remote data collection and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved adherence due to convenience and ease of use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced errors from manual sampling and handling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential for automated alerts and personalised intervention strategies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced long-term tracking for more informed healthcare decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What challenges still stands in the way of needle-free glucose monitoring&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its promise, band-pass Raman spectroscopy faces several challenges before it can be widely implemented. Variations in skin pigmentation, tissue composition, and ambient environmental conditions can affect the Raman signal, necessitating careful calibration for each individual user. Signal processing must effectively separate glucose peaks from background noise, requiring sophisticated algorithms and extensive validation. Device design also needs to balance compactness, comfort, battery life, and reliable wireless connectivity for continuous wear. Researchers are exploring hybrid systems that combine Raman spectroscopy with complementary sensing methods to improve accuracy and robustness. Ensuring consistent performance across different environments and user conditions remains a critical step. Overcoming these challenges is essential to translating laboratory prototypes into practical, everyday tools suitable for clinical use and long-term patient monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Main challenges include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variability in skin tone, tissue composition, and optical properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interference from ambient light, background fluorescence, or environmental factors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requirement for individual calibration to maintain accurate readings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex signal processing to isolate glucose signals reliably&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Device ergonomics and comfort for continuous wear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring consistent performance across different conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with secure wireless transmission and long-lasting battery solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of hybrid systems to improve accuracy and robustness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

								&lt;p&gt;SANTA FE, N.M. — A hiker in the Gila National Forest was bitten by a coyote that tested positive for rabies, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker didn’t require hospitalization. However, they are receiving “routine treatment” to prevent a rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH conducted testing that confirmed the diagnosis. They stated they have seen three other cases of rabid animals in southwest New Mexico this year — a bobcat in Sierra County, a coyote in Catron County and a dog in Grant Country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is preventable, but only if we take it seriously,” said Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH. “The best way to protect your family — including your pets — is to make sure your animals are vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH recommends the following to stay safe from rabies: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on vaccinations and ensure they wear current license tags.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, call your veterinarian for a rabies booster, even if the wound is superficial.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an animal bites you, wash the area immediately and thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention promptly.     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate horses and other household pets, even if they remain exclusively on your property. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any exposure or bite to your local animal control and call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833 796-8773).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

However, we do know that the gut and the brain are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-pinpoints-specific-gut-bacteria-linked-to-alzheimers"&gt;closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, so treating certain regions of the brain could be a way to control food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in brain activity, spotted via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans, were in regions known to be important in the regulation of appetite and addiction – including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_part_of_inferior_frontal_gyrus"&gt;inferior frontal orbital gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome changes, analyzed via stool samples and blood measurements, were linked to particular brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coprococcus comes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobutyricum_hallii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eubacterium hallii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were negatively associated with activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, an area involved in executive function, including our willpower when it comes to food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gut microbiome is thought to communicate with the brain in a complex, two-directional way," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; medical scientist Xiaoning Wang from the State Clinic Center for Geriatrics in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The microbiome produces neurotransmitters and neurotoxins which access the brain through nerves and the blood circulation.

&lt;p&gt;People who regularly consume polyphenol-rich foods and drinks, such as tea, coffee, berries, cocoa, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil, may have better long-term heart health, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, led by King’s College London, found that those with higher adherence to polyphenol-rich dietary patterns had lower predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols, natural compounds found in plants, are linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved heart, brain, and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 3,100 adults from the TwinsUK cohort for over a decade and, for the first time, the researchers also analyzed a large number of metabolites in the urine that are produced when the body breaks down polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that diets rich in specific groups of polyphenols were linked to healthier blood pressure and cholesterol profiles, contributing to lower CVD risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers confirmed that higher levels of polyphenol metabolites—especially those derived from specific groups of polyphenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids—had lower cardiovascular risk scores. They also had increased HDL cholesterol, also know as ‘good cholesterol’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-025-04481-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published recently in&lt;/a&gt; BMC Medicine, used a newly developed polyphenol dietary score (PPS) to capture intake of 20 key polyphenol-rich foods commonly consumed, ranging from tea and coffee to berries, olive oil, nuts, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWEET TIP&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure in Older People by Changing Their Oral Microbiome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beet-juice-lowers-blood-pressure-in-older-people-by-changing-their-oral-microbiome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure in Older People by Changing Their Oral Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This score showed stronger associations with cardiovascular health than estimates of total polyphenol intake, likely because it captures overall dietary patterns rather than individual compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that considering the whole diet provides a more accurate picture of how polyphenol-rich foods work together to support long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that long-term adherence to polyphenol-rich diets can substantially slow the rise in cardiovascular risk as people age,” &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/polyphenol-rich-diets-linked-to-better-long-term-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Human Nutrition at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even small, sustained shifts towards foods like berries, tea, coffee, nuts, and whole grains may help protect the heart over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yong Li, first author of the study, said the research provides “strong evidence that regularly including polyphenol-rich foods in your diet is a simple and effective way to support heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while cardiovascular risk naturally increases with age, higher polyphenol intake was associated with a slower progression of risk over the 11-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;
