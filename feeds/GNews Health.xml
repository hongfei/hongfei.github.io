When Drury's son developed Pandas more than a decade ago, she was willing to pay thousands of dollars for his first IVIG treatment – which, she says, "brought him back to us". The experience prompted her to become an advocate, pushing for a state law that requires insurers to cover treatments including IVIG for Pans/Pandas patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Charlie's Law" &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/life-stages-populations/maternal-child-family-health-services/pandas-pans.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;passed in Illinois in 2017&lt;/a&gt; – but to this day, Drury says, it can be a struggle to get the right treatments for her son, who is now 20. Charlie has had long periods of remission, but also multiple severe flare ups. Clinicians have told him he will need regular IVIG infusions, as well as plasma exchange therapy, for the rest of his life, says Drury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We'd be in these hospitals and they're like, 'We can't help you'," Drury says. "Even though there's a law in his name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pans and Pandas are today recognised by global health authorities – the World Health Organization has added Pandas &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://icd10cmtool.cdc.gov/?fy=FY2021&amp;amp;query=PANDAS" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;to its disease classification system&lt;/a&gt;, for example – and researchers and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://panspandasuk.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;patient support groups across the world&lt;/a&gt; are working to improve quality of care and access to it. In the UK, Pans and Pandas were the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/C36138AE-6DB4-4DA9-84E1-C50C0F9C0A82/PANSAndPANDAS" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;subject of a 2023 parliamentary hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But skepticism still remains in some areas.

			&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long relied on measurements like &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00879.x"&gt;body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratios&lt;/a&gt; to assess health risks. However, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on an unexpected indicator: neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thick neck might project strength, like that of heavyweight boxers or rugby players, but studies suggest it could signal a concerning health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI, which divides weight by height to estimate body fat, doesn't always tell the complete story. A competitive bodybuilder might have a high BMI, but clearly isn't obese. This is where neck circumference offers additional insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-obesity-definition-shifts-focus-from-bmi-heres-the-science-behind-it"&gt;New Obesity Definition Shifts Focus From BMI – Here's The Science Behind It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people with larger necks relative to their body size face increased risks of several serious health conditions. The connection lies in what neck size reveals about fat distribution, particularly in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fat around your &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90357.2008"&gt;upper body&lt;/a&gt; releases fatty acids into your blood, which can interfere with how your body manages cholesterol, blood sugar and heart rhythm. Essentially, neck circumference serves as a proxy for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01160-w"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; – the harmful fat that wraps around your organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence linking neck size to health problems is striking. People with thicker necks show increased rates of several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870319300511"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/"&gt;Atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning. This condition causes irregular heartbeat and blood flow, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2397836"&gt;blood clots and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical imbalance in the heart can eventually progress to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neck circumference also correlates with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743524000148"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the main arteries to the heart narrow and restrict oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cardiovascular problems aren't the only concern. Larger neck circumference increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01111-z"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/correlation-between-neck-circumference-and-gestational-diabetes-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172490" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious long-term complications, including vision loss and limb amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a connection to sleep disorders. Thick necks have been linked to &lt;a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/883776"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt;, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This condition causes extreme daytime fatigue and strains the cardiovascular system. People with sleep apnoea face higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/3971"&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt; due to their exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a risky neck size? For men, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;17 inches (43 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater increases health risks. For women, the threshold is &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;14 inches (35.5 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg" alt="back of a woman's neck" class="wp-image-172496 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Anything above a 14-inch circumference neck size in women may indicate health risks. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEcTuxCZUg/"&gt;Miriam Alonso/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most surprisingly, these risks persist even in people with normal BMI. You could have a healthy weight according to traditional measures, but still face elevated health risks due to neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for each &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/16/6/664/7564829"&gt;additional centimetre&lt;/a&gt; of neck circumference beyond these thresholds, death rates and hospitalisation rates increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your neck measures above these thresholds, it's not cause for panic – but it is worth taking seriously. Neck size represents just one piece of your overall health picture, but it's an important one that's often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle modifications. Cardiovascular exercise and weight training can help reduce upper-body fat. Quality sleep supports metabolic regulation and recovery. A balanced diet rich in pulses, fruits, and vegetables provides essential nutrients without excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring your neck takes seconds with a tape measure. Simply wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, ensuring the tape is snug but not tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg" alt="measuring man's neck" class="wp-image-172499 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Measuring your neck with a tape measure is easy.

While neck circumference shouldn't replace other health assessments, it offers another tool for understanding your cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era where we're constantly seeking better ways to predict and prevent disease, sometimes the answers are literally right in front of us. Your neck might be revealing more about your health than you realise – and it's worth paying attention.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263483/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Known as the “silent assassin,” it often creeps in quietly. You feel fine, yet the force in your arteries runs high day after day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top number, called systolic pressure, is the one doctors watch most closely because it signals how hard your heart is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;working with each beat&lt;/a&gt;. Even a small nudge downward can lower the odds of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have a wide range of medicines that help, but picking the right plan isn’t easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pill or two? Standard dose or higher? Different drug classes or more of the same? People want clear answers before they commit to a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an innovative &lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt; enables doctors to predict how much different medications are likely to lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-blood-pressure-study"&gt;Comprehensive blood pressure study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers pulled together the highest-quality evidence available: 484 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 104,176 participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, average blood pressure hovered around 154/100 mm Hg. Follow-up lasted roughly nine weeks – long enough to see the full effect in a setting where participants took the medicine as prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked direct questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drop can you usually count on from a single standard-dose drug? What happens if you double that dose? What if you combine two different drug classes? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used those answers to build a simple way to predict average results for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;common choices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-show"&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single blood pressure medicine at a standard dose lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic pressure&lt;/a&gt; by 8.7 mm Hg on average. Doubling the dose added about 1.5 mm Hg – modest rather than a big change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drug classes showed more gain with higher doses, especially calcium channel blockers; &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; changed little when the dose increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing two different drug classes – each at a standard dose – produced a larger effect: a 14.9 mm Hg average drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubling both components added another 2.5 mm Hg. Adding a second drug class was around four times more effective than doubling the dose of a single medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-target-many-choices"&gt;Clear target, many choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really important because every 1mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure lowers your risk of heart attack or stroke by two percent,” said Nelson Wang, cardiologist and Research Fellow at &lt;a href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The George Institute for Global Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But with dozens of drugs, multiple doses per drug, and most patients needing two or more drugs, there are literally thousands of possible options, and no easy way to work out how effective they are,” Wang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure changes from moment to moment, day to day and by season – these random fluctuations can easily be as big or larger than the changes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;brought about by treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, measurement practices are often not perfect, bringing in an additional source of uncertainty – this means it’s very hard to reliably assess how well a medicine is working just by taking repeated measurements,” Wang continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-baseline-impact"&gt;Blood pressure baseline impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Starting pressure&lt;/a&gt; matters. Across single-drug regimens, for every 10 mm Hg lower at baseline, the expected drop decreases by about 1.3 mm Hg. Treatment still works at lower baseline pressures; there’s simply less excess pressure to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make decisions easier, the team grouped treatment “intensity” by predicted systolic reduction: low (&amp;lt;10 mm Hg), moderate (10–19 mm Hg), and high (≥20 mm Hg). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most single drugs at standard doses fall into the low category. Many two-drug combinations land in the moderate range, and certain higher-dose pairs or three-drug mixes reach high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predicting-combinations"&gt;Predicting combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis didn’t stop at describing past trials. Using averages from single-drug studies, the researchers predicted the effects of two-drug combinations and compared those predictions with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-5-minutes-of-daily-exercise-can-lower-blood-pressure/"&gt;real trial results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match was strong, with a correlation of about 0.76, suggesting that the calculator offers a realistic expectation for most common pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Rodgers, Senior Professorial Fellow at The George Institute for Global Health, noted that hypertension is a top reason for clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, clinicians haven’t had one up-to-date source that shows how effective different medicines are – especially in combinations or at varying doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using the [&lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt;] challenges the traditional ‘start low, go slow, measure and judge’ approach to treatment, which comes with the high probability of being misled by BP readings, inertia setting in or the burden on patients being too much,” Rodgers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this new method you specify how much you need to lower blood pressure, choose an ideal treatment plan to achieve that based on the evidence, and get the patient started on that ideally sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-all-means"&gt;What it all means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone needs only a small nudge downward, a single medicine at a standard dose is often sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is a bigger change – about 15 to 20 points – adding a second drug class usually gets there more reliably than pushing a single drug to higher doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That matches &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lasers-and-light-replace-the-cuff-in-blood-pressure-breakthrough-scos/"&gt;real-world experience&lt;/a&gt; in clinics where most patients need more than one medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because expected effects depend on baseline, the same regimen appears more potent when baseline pressure is high and slightly less potent when it is closer to the goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity tiers give clinicians a quick yardstick to match treatment to the needed reduction, and then fine-tune based on side effects, other conditions, and ongoing home or clinic readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-blood-pressure-treatment"&gt;Future of blood pressure treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the enormous scale of this challenge, even modest improvements will have a large public health impact – increasing the percentage of people whose hypertension is under control globally to just 50% could save many millions of lives,” Professor Rodgers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small changes matter. A standard-dose medicine typically lowers systolic pressure by a meaningful amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because lower systolic pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, selecting an evidence-based regimen using the intensity framework and calculator can help bring pressure into a safer zone over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00991-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

So far, the duo haven’t seen high numbers of aegypti compared to last year in Talent, though none have been found in Talent this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Partin and Baures said last summer’s public awareness campaign to stamp out aegypti in Talent has paid off, and they’re hoping for the same response in Ashland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a huge cultural shift in Talent,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent was the first area in Oregon where aegypti were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they prefer human blood, the aegypti are most active during the day and are aggressive biters, feeding on ankles, wrists and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can lay larvae in 1/4-inch of standing water.  Marsha MacCormack, who lives near Clay Street, let Partin and Baures set up traps in her shady backyard with a creek flowing through the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jackson County Vector Ecologist Andrew Partin and technician Joe Baures were in Ashland on Thursday morning to collect traps they had deployed on Wednesday.

The netting is pulled out and placed into a plastic bag, where it is frozen back at the lab so it can be inspected. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the canister and a small scent device adds extra enticement for the aegypti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s supposed to mimic how an organism, in this case a human, helps attract the mosquitoes,” Baures said.  The mosquitoes prefer older, established neighborhoods with shade trees and more vegetated backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aegypti were found in California for the first time in 2013, and by 2020, they were discovered in Redding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2022, the aegypti have exploded in Redding,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mosquito Control employees put hang cards on neighborhood doors to warn of the presence of day-biting mosquitoes.

Davis sponsors summer internship programs, which helped to train Baures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilio DeBess, state public health veterinarian in the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, said aegypti’s discovery in Oregon is a concern because the species has been more common in much warmer climates of the United States, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mosquitoes have been known carry and transmit diseases that are more typical to warmer climates, such as Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever,” DeBess said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, DeBess emphasized that the risk of these infections to local residents is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acquiring these diseases depends on the presence or arrival of someone who is currently infected with one of the diseases after infection outside the United States,” DeBess said in a news release. “As was the case when Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were first found in Oregon in 2024, there have been no reports of anyone having acquired viruses associated with Ae. aegypti from within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Staying safe&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;Residents can take these steps to help prevent the spread of aegypti:&lt;br&gt;    • Dumping or draining any standing water around the home.&lt;br&gt;    • Removing containers or objects that can hold water from your yard, such as water saucers from under plants, old tires, tarps, buckets, containers, toys, and other equipment.&lt;br&gt;    • Repairing leaky outdoor faucets.&lt;br&gt;    • Keeping rain gutters cleared.&lt;br&gt;    • Covering, screening, or removing rain barrels, trashcans, bins, buckets, or tubs.&lt;br&gt;    • Wearing mosquito repellent outside. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, some lemon eucalyptus, and para-menthane-diol products are most effective at preventing mosquito bites.&lt;br&gt;    • Sleeping under a mosquito net when outside or in a room without screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach freelance writer Damian Mann at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e2a232f2020202b393d0e29232f2722602d2123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2b6bfb3bcbcbcb7a5a192b5bfb3bbbefcb1bdbf"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related story: &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/oregon-officials-find-mosquito-that-can-transmit-deadly-viruses-in-southern-oregon/"&gt;Oregon officials find mosquito that can transmit deadly viruses in Southern Oregon&lt;/a&gt; (Aug. 31, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ashland News</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE91VTBHOWRnejhYTUMyTlI2TngwdGdIc0w5ZnlXLUVfb3BpY2QxQ0pMQnUxejN6OHVXOXRmazJQX0t3d1RjdFhjNFl3LWdySS1pYWJVeXo5Y1JVNU5fY3V3NEd6RGIzaFkyVU4wVGtVVnJLZw</guid></item><item><title>居民对蚊子传播的衰弱性疾病的担忧加剧： “扩展到新地区” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/concerns-rise-resident-comes-down-233000518.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In summer 2025, a Hong Kong resident developed symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness chikungunya — the first time the area had seen a case in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The illness chikungunya is primarily transmitted via mosquito bites. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/hong-kong-sees-first-mosquito-borne-illness-from-china-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; reported that a 12-year-old developed a rash, fever, and significant joint pain after traveling to Foshan, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In previous weeks, the city of Foshan had reported over 6,500 infections, which had officials worried about the spread, per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department used mosquito control techniques at the patient's home.

                    &lt;p&gt;A recent study from Harvard Medical School asks whether the element lithium might be a key factor in whether someone develops Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, the almost-decade long study says it is the first to show that lithium is found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02471-4"&gt;naturally&lt;/a&gt; in the brain in small amounts and suggests that the element plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; this month found a link between lithium deficiency in the brain and an increase in amyloid plaques and tau tangles — known contributors to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss through a small dosage of a lithium compound called lithium orotate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;

    &lt;p class="pullquote__icon"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="pullquote__quote"&gt;In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts told PBS News that it’s premature to conclude from the results that people should use lithium as a treatment or prophylactic for Alzheimer’s disease — but if the findings are confirmed through a randomized human controlled trial, measuring lithium levels could potentially help with early detection of the disease and provide a broader understanding of aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that if lithium worked out, it might actually restore function, not only change the slope of decline. It certainly does that in the advanced mouse models,” Yankner said. “So I’m optimistic, but we have to hold judgment until we see what happens in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is lithium and how is it used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/ethnic-and-cultural-studies/lithium-li"&gt;Lithium&lt;/a&gt; is a naturally occurring element in the same family as sodium and potassium. The alkali metal is soft and silvery, and used for a variety of purposes, from nuclear power to ceramics, but most famously in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/water-domestic-lithium-mining"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How demand for lithium batteries could drain America’s water resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal has also been used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712976/"&gt;mood stabilizer&lt;/a&gt; for people with bipolar and other mood disorders since the 1900s. &lt;a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/lithium.htm"&gt;7 Up sodas&lt;/a&gt; even contained lithium citrate from 1929 to the 1940s, until the FDA banned the compound from all soda and beer due to reports of overuse leading to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Making_Medicine/NvJjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=FDA+banned+lithium+in+beer+and+soft+drinks&amp;amp;pg=PA42&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;lithium toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies have considered lithium as a factor in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832877/"&gt;Danish study&lt;/a&gt; found there was a possible link between lower rates of dementia in certain regions of Denmark and “microlevels” of lithium in the drinking water, suggesting “even exposure to slightly higher lithium levels over a longer period of time can have a potentially major impact on dementia,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the study found about lithium&lt;/h2&gt;

The authors of a recent medical paper in Nature found that lithium may help protect against brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; used postmortem brain tissue from the Memory and Aging Project by Rush University in Chicago, donated by thousands of study participants ranging across all levels of the cognitive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced tools that could detect trace amounts of metals in the brain and blood — something that older machines were not sensitive enough to do in the past — Yankner’s team found that donors with mild impairment and advanced Alzheimer’s had lower lithium levels compared to cognitively healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors with early signs of memory loss, “the lithium levels were one of the first things to drop,” Yankner said. “And also full-blown Alzheimer’s disease, we saw a few metals had changed, just as other people had seen. But the most significant change was actually in this natural level of lithium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also experimented with restricting the lithium intake of normal mice and Alzheimer’s mice – mice that model Alzheimer genes found in humans. They found that in healthy mice, a lithium-deficient diet accelerated cognitive decline, loss of synaptic connections between neurons and memory loss. In the Alzheimer’s mice, the formation of amyloid plaques – clumps of sticky protein that disrupt brain function that are trademarks of Alzheimer’s disease – was accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-a-mouse-watching-the-matrix-helped-scientists-create-the-largest-map-of-a-brain-to-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How a mouse watching ‘The Matrix’ helped scientists create the largest map of a brain to date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner and his colleagues discovered that lithium gets depleted in the brain when amyloid plaques bind to the metal, which reduces the lithium’s availability to other necessary brain functions, like microglia cells that mount immune responses and repair damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglias are the “scavengers or macrophages of the brain,” Yankner said, and one of their key functions is to clear the amyloid plaques. The researchers discovered that in a lithium-deficient brain, microglia were not able to perform their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tried out various lithium compounds on the mice. The amyloid plaques were found to bind to lithium carbonate, the compound commonly prescribed for mood disorders, making it less effective in preventing the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous clinical trials, lithium carbonate had shown some efficacy in fighting the disease, but the high dosage used can be toxic to older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium orotate, which is currently marketed as a dietary supplement for people, avoided being bound by the amyloid plaques in the study by Yankner’s team. Using a dose of lithium orotate on mice at &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;one-thousandth&lt;/a&gt; the clinical dose of lithium carbonate showed to be the most effective treatment so far for reversing memory loss in the studied animals without causing toxicity, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can taking a lithium supplement prevent Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t start taking a lithium supplement just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice studies do not always reflect human trials, according to Rachel Whitmer, professor of public health sciences and neurology at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“How you translate to applying that experiment [in mice] to humans is more complicated and takes longer, but with the right planning, it can absolutely happen and it can absolutely be successful,” said Whitmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner added that his team is exploring “whether lithium orotate is the best we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using the screening approach and platform we’ve developed, we might even be able to find a better lithium compound,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, said it is too early for people to alter their diets or use a lithium replacement for a potential approach to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease. He recommended watching the next stages of this line of research as it “may be a potential insight into one of the therapeutic pathways,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been major advances in Alzheimer’s research, according to Whitmer. In the past, one of the only ways to identify the disease was finding tau tangles and amyloid plaques in the brain during an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and medical researchers have developed tests to detect biomarkers – biological molecules found in blood that can indicate the presence of conditions or diseases – &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/2021-2022-alzheimers-disease-related-dementias-scientific-advances/biomarker-research"&gt;for Alzheimer’s in living patients&lt;/a&gt;. Health care providers can also perform &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests#brain"&gt;brain imaging and lumbar punctures,&lt;/a&gt; to determine if a person has abnormal levels of amyloid and tau in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, plasma markers, which are blood-based biomarkers, have suggested to scientists that underlying pathologies in the brain can be seen in blood, according to Petersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner said the next steps will be determining whether there is an effective dose of lithium orotate or another lithium compound for humans that treats Alzheimer’s with minimal toxicity, as well as finding a diagnostic blood test that can reliably identify lithium deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how risk factors for diabetes or heart disease can show up in blood tests today, Yankner envisions a future where people can learn if they are at risk for Alzheimer’s from their annual physical with a primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one had a way of examining the lithium status of a person, that might dictate very early treatment,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;

That glucose is released into your bloodstream. And insulin helps it move into your cells, where it gets used as energy. But when that final step doesn’t happen, glucose can build up in your bloodstream—causing you to have high blood sugar and experience hyperglycemia symptoms, which may be indicators of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High blood sugar—also called hyperglycemia—means there’s too much glucose in your bloodstream,” says &lt;a href="https://www.conference-board.org/bio/lisa-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lisa Shah, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a physician who specializes in metabolic health. This typically happens because your body doesn’t produce insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), doesn’t produce enough insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), or isn’t able to use insulin effectively (prediabetes and type 2 diabetes), she explains.

But you may not experience any symptoms at first, says &lt;a href="https://aeroflowdiabetes.com/akhil-shenoy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Akhil Shenoy, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Akhil Shenoy, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, endocrinologist and internal medicine physician. “Hyperglycemia doesn’t always feel obvious right away,” Dr. Shah explains. “The symptoms can be gradual and vague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, experts recommend &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a40657574/diabetes-tests-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:routine screening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;routine screening&lt;/a&gt;—especially if you have risk factors for diabetes. Even if you don’t, you should keep an eye out for the following high blood sugar symptoms and get to a doctor if you experience several of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood sugar symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly running to the toilet? Hyperglycemia may be to blame. “When [your] blood sugar is high, your body works hard to bring it back into balance,” Dr. Shah says. Your kidneys go into overdrive trying to flush out that extra sugar. “Since the kidneys cannot simply push out solid sugar cubes, [they] draw water to go along with the sugar, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65782866/reasons-you-always-have-to-pee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excessive urination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excessive urination&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body is a system. So as your kidneys work to get rid of that extra glucose—and as you start peeing more—you’ll also get thirstier. “The brain senses high glucose and signals you to drink more water,” Dr. Makhija explains. You might catch yourself reaching for your water bottle more often. You might also experience &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a65870951/signs-of-dehydration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dehydration symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dehydration symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, like weakness and dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia can make you feel weak, exhausted, and unlike your usual self. “You might feel tired, fatigued, or sluggish,” Dr. Shah says. “You might feel foggy or have a hard time concentrating on something.” In general, you’ll just feel “off,” she explains. And as time goes on, you might notice more obvious high blood sugar symptoms, like increased thirst and urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent hunger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have high blood sugar, glucose gets “stuck” in your bloodstream, Dr. Shenoy explains. “Meanwhile, the cells of the body—such as the brain, the heart, and the muscle cells—are not receiving the sugar that is needed for normal function,” he says. Your body may try to compensate by going into “starvation mode,” making you feel hungrier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar can cause rapid, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/g20441544/losing-weight-without-trying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unexplained weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;unexplained weight loss&lt;/a&gt;—for a couple of different reasons. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts burning fat and muscle instead, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-you-should-know-about-unexplained-weight-loss-and-diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is an unhealthy type of weight loss,” Dr. Shenoy explains. Urinating more and dehydration can also contribute to weight loss, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blurry vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged high glucose may &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes-and-your-eyes-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:damage blood vessels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;damage blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and nerves throughout the body—including your eyes. The macula (a part of the eye) can swell due to leaky blood vessels (known as macular edema), resulting in blurry vision. While diabetic retinopathy tends to happen after very long periods of high blood sugars, causing leaking blood vessels or new abnormal ones to grow, this tends to lead to blindness. Again, that’s the worst-case scenario, and it often takes a while to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia may make your vision blurry, simply because it makes you dehydrated. “Dehydration affects the eyes, particularly the retinas, which have a rich blood supply,” Dr. Makhija says. When you’re low on fluids, your eyes may get blurry. This is usually a temporary condition. “[But] if sugars remain high for many years, the eye can be permanently damaged,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic high blood sugar “impairs the immune response,” making it harder for your body to fight off infections, Dr. Makhija explains. And being dehydrated all the time certainly doesn’t help, she adds. Because of this, you may find yourself getting sick more often—and staying sick longer than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hyperglycemia &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/poor-immune-response-impairs-diabetic-wound-healing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:impacts your immune response;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;impacts your immune response&lt;/a&gt;, it can also make it harder for your body to heal cuts and bruises. Chronic high blood sugar can also cause poor circulation and nerve damage, which can “reduce awareness of injury and delay healing,” compounding the problem, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fruity breath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruity breath isn’t merely a sign of high blood sugar—it’s a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a dangerous hyperglycemia complication. When your body starts burning protein and fat for energy, it releases ketones, Dr. Makhija explains. One of these ketones, acetone, can make your breath smell fruity or metallic—and it’s a warning sign you need to see a doctor ASAP. Untreated DKA can lead to death, so head to the emergency room, stat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar can cause fatigue and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34600381/what-is-brain-fog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain fog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;. But if those symptoms become more severe—and you feel confused, disoriented, or delirious—you may need immediate medical care. These “changes in mental status” may be symptoms of DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), potentially life-threatening hyperglycemia complications, per &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Upset stomach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps are warning signs of DKA. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts to burn fat and protein—and releases ketones in the process. As those ketones build up in your gastrointestinal tract, they can upset your stomach. “If you experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or mental fog, check your ketones and seek urgent care,” Dr. Makhija says. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fshop%2Fcvs-health-ketone-test-strips-50-ct-prodid-182676&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65901564%2Fsymptoms-high-blood-sugar%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ketone Sticks;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Ketone Sticks&lt;/a&gt; are over-the-counter test strips that detect ketones in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood sugar complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though high blood sugar starts subtly, it can cause serious complications if left untreated. “You may not feel symptoms in the early stages, but long-term high blood sugar can quietly cause irreversible damage,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glucose builds up in your bloodstream, it can damage your blood vessels—and subsequently your organs and nerves, Dr. Shenoy explains. Chronic high blood sugar can also lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), two serious complications that can cause coma, organ damage, and death in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of high blood sugar that’s especially common in people with type 1 diabetes, explains Dr. Makhija. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts breaking down fat and protein instead. “A byproduct of this process is ketones, which are acidic compounds that build up in the blood and make it dangerously acidic,” Dr. Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DKA symptoms may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased thirst or dehydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue or weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent hunger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruity breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting or coma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When left untreated, DKA may cause a range of dangerous complications, including organ damage, coma, and even death, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “DKA is a life-threatening emergency and requires urgent treatment,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is another dangerous hyperglycemia complication, but it’s more common among people with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Makhija explains. When your blood sugar stays high for too long, it can cause extreme dehydration and confusion—without the excess ketones you see in DKA, Dr. Shenoy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS is similar [to DKA] in that blood sugar is extremely high, but your body produces enough insulin to prevent ketones from building up,” Dr. Shah says. “Instead, the problem is that the excess sugar makes your blood very concentrated. Your body then tries to dilute it by pulling water from elsewhere into the bloodstream, which exacerbates dehydration and throws off electrolyte balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21147-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, HHS symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine blood test (or even a finger prick) can give your doctor insight into your levels. The good news, when caught early, there are many medications available (from &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a41994246/ozempic-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; to full-on insulin) to help manage blood sugars. If you have the symptoms on this list or are simply concerned that your blood sugar is high, ask your healthcare provider about next steps. If you believe you are experiencing DKA or HHS, seek immediate treatment. In severe cases, these conditions may cause seizures, organ damage, coma, and death. “If symptoms escalate or you’re unsure, call 911 or go to the emergency room,” Dr. Makhija says. “DKA and HHS are not manageable at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 20:19:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFByUXk4SVlta0NNclVhTVdvWmdJRnl1c3dLRG9FRTNJdXY4eExKNHhhM2VUckIxSmZ5c3FSaTlNQWhUTVBERGdCTWgxNFQ1XzZWQnlkVjBtTGFteVpvS2FRSUE2bUtPTTI4eF9YTmNYTV8zOWc</guid></item><item><title>公共卫生部新闻稿清单-洛杉矶县公共卫生部（ .gov ）</title><link>http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5125</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container-xl p-4"&gt;

							&lt;h1 class="h3"&gt;Public Health Reporting an Increase in Flea-Borne Typhus Cases in Los 
Angeles County - People urged to take precautions to protect 
themselves and their pets 
							&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;							
			&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is urging people to take precautions following an increase of flea-borne typhus cases across the County. Earlier this year, Public Health investigated a localized outbreak of flea-borne typhus in Central Los Angeles and is currently investigating a second outbreak in the City of Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flea-borne typhus cases have been rising in Los Angeles County since 2010. In 2024, a record 187 cases were identified. So far in 2025, 106 cases have already been reported, higher than this time last year. Public Health expects additional cases and clusters to appear in the coming months, as flea-borne typhus infections peak in late summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This ongoing increase in flea-borne typhus highlights the importance of taking preventive steps to reduce the risk of infection,” said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County Health Officer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Flea-Borne Typhus (Typhus)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by &lt;em&gt;Rickettsia Typhi&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which is spread by infected fleas. People can become infected when flea feces are rubbed into cuts or scrapes on the skin or rubbed into the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, infected fleas are most commonly found on rats, free-roaming cats, and opossums. Pets such as dogs and cats that go outdoors can bring fleas into and around your home. Infected animals typically do not show signs of illness. Flea-borne typhus is not spread from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flea-borne typhus is serious, but preventable,” said Dr. Davis. “We urge people to take precautions by using flea control on their pets, avoiding contact with stray animals, and preventing wildlife from living in or next to their home or property. If you develop symptoms, such as fever, chills, or a rash, seek medical attention right away.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Prevent Flea-Borne Typhus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health encourages people to follow these preventive steps to the risk of flea-borne typhus infections:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Keep fleas off you and your pets.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o When outside, use EPA-registered insect repellent labeled for protection against fleas.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Routinely use flea control products on your pets.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Keep pets indoors as much as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Avoid attracting wild or stray animals.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Don’t leave pet food or water outside. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Don’t feed or touch stray or wild animals.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Keep your yard free of debris and overgrown plants.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Store trash in containers with tightly fitting lids.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Close off crawl spaces and seal any openings where animals could enter, hide, or find food and water.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Report stray animals or signs of rodents or opossums near your property to local animal control officials. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;

That glucose is released into your bloodstream. And insulin helps it move into your cells, where it gets used as energy. But when that final step doesn’t happen, glucose can build up in your bloodstream—causing you to have high blood sugar and experience hyperglycemia symptoms, which may be indicators of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“High blood sugar—also called hyperglycemia—means there’s too much glucose in your bloodstream,” says &lt;a href="https://www.conference-board.org/bio/lisa-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lisa Shah, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a physician who specializes in metabolic health. This typically happens because your body doesn’t produce insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), doesn’t produce enough insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), or isn’t able to use insulin effectively (prediabetes and type 2 diabetes), she explains. But you can experience hyperglycemia even if you don’t have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unifiedendocrinecare.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chhaya Makhija, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chhaya Makhija, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO, founder, and endocrinologist at Unified Endocrine and Diabetes Care; &lt;a href="https://www.conference-board.org/bio/lisa-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lisa Shah, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, physician, executive vice president, and chief medical officer at &lt;a href="https://usa.twinhealth.com/company" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Twin Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twin Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://aeroflowdiabetes.com/akhil-shenoy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Akhil Shenoy, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Akhil Shenoy, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, endocrinologist, internal medicine physician, and medical adviser at Aeroflow Diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When left untreated, high blood sugar can make you feel tired, weak, and dehydrated—and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20481244/unexpected-side-effects-of-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potentially life-threatening complications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;potentially life-threatening complications&lt;/a&gt;, like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)—more on these below. But you may not experience any symptoms at first, says &lt;a href="https://aeroflowdiabetes.com/akhil-shenoy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Akhil Shenoy, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Akhil Shenoy, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, endocrinologist and internal medicine physician. “Hyperglycemia doesn’t always feel obvious right away,” Dr. Shah explains. “The symptoms can be gradual and vague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because of this, experts recommend &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a40657574/diabetes-tests-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:routine screening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;routine screening&lt;/a&gt;—especially if you have risk factors for diabetes. Even if you don’t, you should keep an eye out for the following high blood sugar symptoms and get to a doctor if you experience several of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;High blood sugar symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Constantly running to the toilet? Hyperglycemia may be to blame. “When [your] blood sugar is high, your body works hard to bring it back into balance,” Dr. Shah says. Your kidneys go into overdrive trying to flush out that extra sugar. “Since the kidneys cannot simply push out solid sugar cubes, [they] draw water to go along with the sugar, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65782866/reasons-you-always-have-to-pee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excessive urination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;excessive urination&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your body is a system. So as your kidneys work to get rid of that extra glucose—and as you start peeing more—you’ll also get thirstier. “The brain senses high glucose and signals you to drink more water,” Dr. Makhija explains. You might catch yourself reaching for your water bottle more often. You might also experience &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a65870951/signs-of-dehydration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dehydration symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dehydration symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, like weakness and dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hyperglycemia can make you feel weak, exhausted, and unlike your usual self. “You might feel tired, fatigued, or sluggish,” Dr. Shah says. “You might feel foggy or have a hard time concentrating on something.” In general, you’ll just feel “off,” she explains. And as time goes on, you might notice more obvious high blood sugar symptoms, like increased thirst and urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Persistent hunger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you have high blood sugar, glucose gets “stuck” in your bloodstream, Dr. Shenoy explains. “Meanwhile, the cells of the body—such as the brain, the heart, and the muscle cells—are not receiving the sugar that is needed for normal function,” he says. Your body may try to compensate by going into “starvation mode,” making you feel hungrier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High blood sugar can cause rapid, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/g20441544/losing-weight-without-trying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unexplained weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;unexplained weight loss&lt;/a&gt;—for a couple of different reasons. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts burning fat and muscle instead, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-you-should-know-about-unexplained-weight-loss-and-diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is an unhealthy type of weight loss,” Dr. Shenoy explains. Urinating more and dehydration can also contribute to weight loss, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Blurry vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prolonged high glucose may &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes-and-your-eyes-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:damage blood vessels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;damage blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and nerves throughout the body—including your eyes. The macula (a part of the eye) can swell due to leaky blood vessels (known as macular edema), resulting in blurry vision. While diabetic retinopathy tends to happen after very long periods of high blood sugars, causing leaking blood vessels or new abnormal ones to grow, this tends to lead to blindness. Again, that’s the worst-case scenario, and it often takes a while to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hyperglycemia may make your vision blurry, simply because it makes you dehydrated. “Dehydration affects the eyes, particularly the retinas, which have a rich blood supply,” Dr. Makhija says. When you’re low on fluids, your eyes may get blurry. This is usually a temporary condition. “[But] if sugars remain high for many years, the eye can be permanently damaged,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Frequent infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chronic high blood sugar “impairs the immune response,” making it harder for your body to fight off infections, Dr. Makhija explains. And being dehydrated all the time certainly doesn’t help, she adds. Because of this, you may find yourself getting sick more often—and staying sick longer than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since hyperglycemia &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/poor-immune-response-impairs-diabetic-wound-healing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:impacts your immune response;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;impacts your immune response&lt;/a&gt;, it can also make it harder for your body to heal cuts and bruises. Chronic high blood sugar can also cause poor circulation and nerve damage, which can “reduce awareness of injury and delay healing,” compounding the problem, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Fruity breath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fruity breath isn’t merely a sign of high blood sugar—it’s a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a dangerous hyperglycemia complication. When your body starts burning protein and fat for energy, it releases ketones, Dr. Makhija explains. One of these ketones, acetone, can make your breath smell fruity or metallic—and it’s a warning sign you need to see a doctor ASAP. Untreated DKA can lead to death, so head to the emergency room, stat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High blood sugar can cause fatigue and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34600381/what-is-brain-fog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain fog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;. But if those symptoms become more severe—and you feel confused, disoriented, or delirious—you may need immediate medical care. These “changes in mental status” may be symptoms of DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), potentially life-threatening hyperglycemia complications, per &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Upset stomach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps are warning signs of DKA. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts to burn fat and protein—and releases ketones in the process. As those ketones build up in your gastrointestinal tract, they can upset your stomach. “If you experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or mental fog, check your ketones and seek urgent care,” Dr. Makhija says. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fshop%2Fcvs-health-ketone-test-strips-50-ct-prodid-182676&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65901564%2Fsymptoms-high-blood-sugar%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ketone Sticks;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Ketone Sticks&lt;/a&gt; are over-the-counter test strips that detect ketones in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;High blood sugar complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though high blood sugar starts subtly, it can cause serious complications if left untreated. “You may not feel symptoms in the early stages, but long-term high blood sugar can quietly cause irreversible damage,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When glucose builds up in your bloodstream, it can damage your blood vessels—and subsequently your organs and nerves, Dr. Shenoy explains. Chronic high blood sugar can also lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), two serious complications that can cause coma, organ damage, and death in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of high blood sugar that’s especially common in people with type 1 diabetes, explains Dr. Makhija. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts breaking down fat and protein instead. “A byproduct of this process is ketones, which are acidic compounds that build up in the blood and make it dangerously acidic,” Dr. Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DKA symptoms may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Increased thirst or dehydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When left untreated, DKA may cause a range of dangerous complications, including organ damage, coma, and even death, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “DKA is a life-threatening emergency and requires urgent treatment,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is another dangerous hyperglycemia complication, but it’s more common among people with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Makhija explains. When your blood sugar stays high for too long, it can cause extreme dehydration and confusion—without the excess ketones you see in DKA, Dr. Shenoy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“HHS is similar [to DKA] in that blood sugar is extremely high, but your body produces enough insulin to prevent ketones from building up,” Dr. Shah says. “Instead, the problem is that the excess sugar makes your blood very concentrated. Your body then tries to dilute it by pulling water from elsewhere into the bloodstream, which exacerbates dehydration and throws off electrolyte balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21147-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, HHS symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Increased thirst or dehydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Weakness, especially on one side of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A routine blood test (or even a finger prick) can give your doctor insight into your levels. The good news, when caught early, there are many medications available (from &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a41994246/ozempic-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; to full-on insulin) to help manage blood sugars. If you have the symptoms on this list or are simply concerned that your blood sugar is high, ask your healthcare provider about next steps. If you believe you are experiencing DKA or HHS, seek immediate treatment. In severe cases, these conditions may cause seizures, organ damage, coma, and death. “If symptoms escalate or you’re unsure, call 911 or go to the emergency room,” Dr. Makhija says. “DKA and HHS are not manageable at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 18:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPTFlwMEttTWJfVWZYNmZCcXIwNThHbFhOSkl6QkpieVVWNThZVVNlNFVUb084R2F2djZodUdBUXQ0eG5HRUhBbDVTbzJzSGw3UDRWQVQwaFJWQmR4eHBGaWpLRTNZeF9jQm94bnV5bkl0ZU9ld3BBQlhTY2xGNVlsNWYwTjEzbVNx</guid></item><item><title>HHS在CDC主任下台后安排下一次疫苗小组会议- Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/28/hhs-schedules-next-vaccine-panel-meeting-after-cdc-director-ousted-00534042</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:54:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNSFRmTkdfVE1xeGpVSDdTTzhueUEyX0VXRGI3ekFCamFLMHY0VU5waDZHQlhxd0JVNTM5NE1pZTlBekt3S093TUNfSFRsTUsxbkxsVmNpUE43UU84UGdRSTh0WW0xWUhUVE5SZEZUNXhoRWxBdmJKXzQ4b2Y1NTAzZndxNHJicXBjSk1XVF9ITG1CSTAxblA5cXFNeUJNdDdDZkhWNGx6aXJpQ3pGQTZtVzVTLXBWYlU</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，超加工饮食会降低男性性激素--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/28/ultra-processed-sperm-quality-male-fertility/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3MIKVODWYVB3FNVM7ACIDSSVZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A small but rigorous new &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.004" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating ultra-processed foods caused otherwise healthy men to quickly gain body fat and led to reductions in their sex hormones.

					&lt;p&gt;Lacing up your sneakers for a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tips-to-walk-faster-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;brisk walk&lt;/a&gt; is a simple way to rev up your daily cardio. But did you know that weaving targeted &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-indoor-walking-workouts-shrink-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;walking exercises&lt;/a&gt; into your routine could actually help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-exercises-for-slim-waistline/" target="_blank"&gt;tighten and tone your waistline&lt;/a&gt;? We spoke with a fitness pro who shares five walking moves that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/moves-melt-deep-belly-fat-fast/" target="_blank"&gt;melt belly fat&lt;/a&gt; faster than a gym session—especially for those 45 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been a personal trainer for 28 years and nothing beats walking,” says &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/nicopilates/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nico Gonzalez&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;ACE-CPT, ACE-GFI, NPCP, BBPI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;Balanced Body educator and global movement trainer and educator. “I haven’t found a better way to keep your body moving, increase your body temperature, and increase your mood. Walking can be done every day and multiple times a day. Want to lose weight? A walking program NEEDS to be included in your weekly schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Walking Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Faster Than the Gym&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-rounded weight-loss regimen includes moving your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/is-walking-every-day-enough-to-stay-fit/" target="_blank"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; is one of the easier ways to move and is key for weight loss and provides many more benefits,” Gonzalez says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, Gonzalez breaks down a 10-minute walking workout that alternates your pace. It’s simple, ultra-effective, and perfect for beginners. Make sure to pre-hydrate and sip water or electrolytes throughout the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute: slow pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes: steady pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes: fast pace walking and pumping arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes: steady pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes: fast pace walking and pumping arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute: slow pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to ramp things up, Gonzalez shares another 10-minute routine that adds more energy expenditure to your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute: steady pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 seconds: fast pace walking and pumping arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 seconds: steady pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat for a total 8 rounds of 30 second intervals (fast / steady)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 minute: steady pace walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez stresses the importance of a solid full-body warm-up to “get all the kinks out.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Make sure your body is ready to workout! I have found that my clients are more successful when we do a full body warm up,” Gonzalez points out. “Move the body in multiple directions. Moving legs, core, and the upper body. No need to add any fancy equipment. Just start moving lightly with good form and full range.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a weighted vest to your walking session introduces an effective strength element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you find yourself in a good routine for at least four weeks, you may want to add some resistance,” Gonzalez notes. “I like to start with adding just five pounds on a weight vest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good ol’ outdoors presents a variety of challenging and invigorating terrain to explore. Plus, some fresh air and sunshine is good for the mind, body, and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The moment I started personally walking outside, my entire perspective of outdoor workouts changed,” Gonzalez says. “Since we got a dog last year, I started enjoying steady walks with our little pup. Instantly, I realized the benefits of being outside! Cleared my mind, enjoyed fresh air, different scenery daily, and the terrain slightly changed which kept me on my toes. All good things.”&lt;/p&gt;

It is more likely to cause serious problems in older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/heart-disease","type":"Keyword","title":"Heart disease"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"Keyword","title":"UK news"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/andrew-gregory","type":"Contributor","title":"Andrew Gregory"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/aug/28/shingles-vaccine-heart-cardiovascular-medical-research","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most countries tend to only recommend the vaccine to older people or immunosuppressed adults but the findings suggest it could have cardiovascular protective effects in adults as young as 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results from the study, the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis, shows the jab is associated with a significant lower risk of cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Having the shingles jab was associated with an 18% lower risk of stroke or heart attack in adults 18 and above. There was a 16% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in adults 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The data will be presented this weekend to thousands of cardiologists at the annual meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;European Society of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; in Madrid, the world’s largest cardiology conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charles Williams, the study’s author and global associate medical director at GSK, said: “We looked at the currently available evidence, and found that in this analysis, vaccination against herpes zoster was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Further research studies are now needed to find out whether this association can be attributed to an effect of herpes zoster vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The global systematic review was conducted using three scientific literature databases, and a meta analysis was conducted of phase 3 randomised controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shingles jab is usually just taken once, and is typically administered in two doses, several months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Eight observational studies and one randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for studying the impact of the jab on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination is increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Filippo Crea, a cardiology professor at the Catholic University in Rome, who was not involved with the study, said: “These results support a growing body of evidence … which indicates that vaccinations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, also not involved with the research, welcomed the findings but said further research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said: “There is great interest in studies suggesting the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, although this analysis is largely based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that shingles can cause inflammation in the body, and that inflammation is a culprit in many heart and circulatory conditions which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By preventing shingles, vaccination could therefore be protective. But far more research is needed, especially to understand the intriguing results in younger people. More evidence will be needed before the shingles vaccine can be recommended for a wider age group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings came as NHS England said &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/08/shingles-vaccine-to-be-offered-to-hundreds-of-thousands-more-immunosuppressed-adults/#:~:text=Around%20300%2C000%20more%20people%20will,protect%20all%20severely%20immunosuppressed%20adults." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 more people would become eligible for the shingles jab from next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People eligible from 1 September are those between 18 and 49 with a severely weakened immune system. The NHS previously expanded eligibility to include people over 50 with a severely weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 16:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTzdGNVAzbDZoa01SOEVrZGJ5OUNzRDNycUswdlFic19fRGotZkxXTk5TUnlITTBQVkQxM2FHYW51VlFmdUgyOU9EbENwRDZlOE1wa1dWXzdMb0dtb09fRG9TRE9rVmVQUmVRUVBiekVKOGh6Q0FXZWlqLUNndlRaa1dzWnQxa0txWS0yRGhUTGN0c2lFWFBMejRHd2d1N0RiSGVvZg</guid></item><item><title>绘制法国的“1789年大恐惧” ，展示错误信息如何像病毒一样传播- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-08-france-great-misinformation-virus.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the rise of the internet and social media, society has become well-acquainted with the idea of "virality" as the rapid spread of ideas and information (or misinformation). The relatively recent COVID-19 pandemic also reminded modern society of how rapidly viruses spread and how they impact society.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the idea of information spreading like a virus is not just an apt metaphor—information virality can also be scientifically modeled in the same way as an actual virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the better known "viral outbreaks" of misinformation in history is the "Great Fear of 1789." In a matter of only a couple of weeks, between July 20, 1789 and August 6, 1789, rumors that the aristocracy were planning to starve the peasants spread throughout France, leading to panic, unrest, and riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this conspiracy was not based in fact, this time period was rife with unrest between the peasantry and aristocracy and the event played a key role in the French Revolution, eventually leading to the collapse of feudalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much debate and confusion has surrounded the manner in which the Great Fear spread so quickly. However, in a new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09392-2" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, a team of researchers have taken a different approach at figuring out this mystery by modeling the spread of the rumors circulated during the Great Fear of 1789 with the same epidemiological approach used to study the transmission of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team mapped out and digitized the spread of the rumors with the help of detailed historical documents from &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/greatfearof17890000unse" target="_blank"&gt;Georges Lefebvre&lt;/a&gt;, who archived locations and times where historical sources confirm that the rumors had spread.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The team then used epidemiological models to analyze the spread and calculate key parameters like the basic reproduction number, defined as the expected number of cases spread by one person in a population in which all individuals are susceptible to the "infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that the spread of the Great Fear did indeed closely follow patterns of infectious disease. The researchers calculated that the rumors spread with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 and peaked on July 30, then rapidly declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also identified a series of "risk factors" associated with areas of the highest transmission, which included towns that were more populous, literate, and wealthier, and where &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/land+ownership/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;land ownership&lt;/a&gt; was more concentrated and wheat prices were higher. Transmission often occurred along main roads and postal routes and also in "distinct waves of contagion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors note the similarity of spread between rumors and disease within highly populated areas, saying, "This is a general property of infectious diseases, where well-connected centers with large populations are likely to become the hub for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/disease+transmission/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disease transmission&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When speaking on the debate of whether this event was either emotionally charged or the result of a political motivation, the study authors note, "This picture is consistent with interpretation of the Great Fear as a politically driven event, rooted in rational behavior and responding to the local feudal legal environment, and is in contrast to the idea of an emotional outburst."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's likely that the transmission mapping involved in the study is incomplete due to missing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/historical+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;historical records&lt;/a&gt;, this study helps to provide a framework for understanding how rumors and misinformation can drive social and political change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach might be applied to other historical or modern &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rumor&lt;/a&gt; and insurrection events, perhaps with some modifications to better fit the digital means of transmission used today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long relied on measurements like &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00879.x"&gt;body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratios&lt;/a&gt; to assess health risks. However, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on an unexpected indicator: neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thick neck might project strength, like that of heavyweight boxers or rugby players, but studies suggest it could signal a concerning health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMI, which divides weight by height to estimate body fat, doesn’t always tell the complete story. A competitive bodybuilder might have a high BMI, but clearly isn’t obese. This is where neck circumference offers additional insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people with larger necks relative to their body size face increased risks of several serious health conditions. The connection lies in what neck size reveals about fat distribution, particularly in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fat around your &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90357.2008"&gt;upper body&lt;/a&gt; releases fatty acids into your blood, which can interfere with how your body manages cholesterol, blood sugar and heart rhythm. Essentially, neck circumference serves as a proxy for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01160-w"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; – the harmful fat that wraps around your organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence linking neck size to health problems is striking. People with thicker necks show increased rates of several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870319300511"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/"&gt;Atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning. This condition causes irregular heartbeat and blood flow, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2397836"&gt;blood clots and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical imbalance in the heart can eventually progress to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neck circumference also correlates with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743524000148"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the main arteries to the heart narrow and restrict oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But cardiovascular problems aren’t the only concern. Larger neck circumference increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01111-z"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/correlation-between-neck-circumference-and-gestational-diabetes-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Diabetes can lead to serious long-term complications, including vision loss and limb amputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a connection to sleep disorders. Thick necks have been linked to &lt;a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/883776"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt;, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This condition causes extreme daytime fatigue and strains the cardiovascular system. People with sleep apnoea face higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/3971"&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt; due to their exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a risky neck size? For men, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;17 inches (43cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater increases health risks. For women, the threshold is &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;14 inches (35.5cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;17 inches or more is a risk factor for men.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;lolostock/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most surprisingly, these risks persist even in people with normal BMI. You could have a healthy weight according to traditional measures, but still face elevated health risks due to neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for each &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/16/6/664/7564829"&gt;additional centimetre&lt;/a&gt; of neck circumference beyond these thresholds, death rates and hospitalisation rates increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your neck measures above these thresholds, it’s not cause for panic – but it is worth taking seriously. Neck size represents just one piece of your overall health picture, but it’s an important one that’s often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle modifications. Cardiovascular exercise and weight training can help reduce upper-body fat. Quality sleep supports metabolic regulation and recovery. A balanced diet rich in pulses, fruits, and vegetables provides essential nutrients without excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring your neck takes seconds with a tape measure. Simply wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, ensuring the tape is snug but not tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple measurement could provide valuable insight into health risks that traditional metrics might miss. While neck circumference shouldn’t replace other health assessments, it offers another tool for understanding your cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where we’re constantly seeking better ways to predict and prevent disease, sometimes the answers are literally right in front of us. Your neck might be revealing more about your health than you realise – and it’s worth paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

After 40 minutes, it hits 118F, and after an hour, it can rise to 123F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking water from plastic bottles left in vehicles could slowly poison the body, health experts are warning (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following their investigation, Nanjing University advised against storing plastic water bottles in warm temperatures, as the release of antimony and BPA increased with storage temperature, especially at 158°F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study in 2023 found similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, also looked at the impact of high temperatures on plastic water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that four common plastics, including polyethylene, released microparticles and nanoparticles when they were heated to 98.6F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Control samples that were kept in a dark, 40F refrigerator, however, released few to no particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent study found that no matter what the brand, bottles of plastic water contain hundreds of thousands of toxic microscopic plastic particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists using the most advanced laser scanning techniques found an average of 240,000 plastic particles in a one-liter bottle of water, compared to 5.5 per one liter of tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Columbia University researchers tested three popular brands of bottled water sold in the US - and, using lasers, analyzed the plastic particles they contained down to just 100 nanometers in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The particles - nanoplastics - are much smaller than the microplastics previously detected in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the particles are considered potentially toxic because they are so small that they can enter directly into blood cells and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These microscopic particles carry phthalates - chemicals that make plastics more durable, flexible, and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalate exposure is attributed to 100,000 premature deaths in the US each year. The chemicals are known to interfere with hormone production in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are 'linked with developmental, reproductive, brain, immune, and other problems', according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest estimates found 370,000 particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One recent study found, no matter what the brand, bottles of plastic water contain hundreds of thousands of toxic microscopic plastic particles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study out of Jiroft University of Medical Science in Iran found that microplastics were found in all colorectal cancer tissue samples studied. The accumulation of these substances was higher in cancerous tissues compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the findings, health experts across the board have called for policymakers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from London-based Deep Science Ventures warned after they conducted an eight-month investigation into the impact of chemical exposure on human health: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility, especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives. This is important because human and planetary health is at stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For us to ensure our continued development and ability to thrive as a human species, we have to accelerate the growth of innovative, technological solutions and ensure these are funded and scaled at pace.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the International Bottled Water Association, Americans drink some 15 billion gallons of bottled water each year - around 45 gallons per person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:48:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>患有癌症的猫可能是人类新疗法的关键-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/cats-cancer-human-therapies-78j7vpzd2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When Jak, a black domestic short hair cat, was diagnosed with a lethal head and neck cancer, his prognosis was grim: six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Thanks to a pioneering medical trial he survived more than eight months, had one last Christmas with his owners and taught researchers an important lesson: cats may outshine lab mice when it comes to testing new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jak was one of 20 cats with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the first study of a therapy that targets STAT3, a protein long considered “undruggable” but implicated in many &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/cancer" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;human cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="6bd6e406-c374-4d42-8658-0ef87c3bb22f"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The treatment improved Jak’s symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;STAT3 is a transcription factor, a protein that controls which genes are turned on or off by binding to specific sections of DNA. The therapy works in two&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; ways. It blocks STAT3’s cancer-promoting activity and also boosts PD-1, a protein that stimulates the immune system’s attack on tumours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the trial, the drug stabilised or partially reduced the cancers in seven — 35 per cent — of the 20 cats. Most experienced only minimal side-effects; only mild &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/iron-deficiency-anemia-symptoms-cause-treatment-src27cp5n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;anaemia&lt;/a&gt; was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the cats that responded to the treatment, it also seemed to boost the immune system, showing increased levels of PD-1 in their tumours and changes in blood immune markers. The average survival for these cats was about five months after treatment. Cats with this cancer usually die within two to three months. In people, similar cancers often resist even the most advanced therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers are now working with a biotech company to prepare for human testing. “There are two major findings from this study,” said Daniel Johnson of the University of California, San Francisco, senior author of a paper published in the journal Cancer Cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It showed us that it’s possible to target a transcription factor that drives oncogenesis, which is something that has been notoriously difficult in the past. Also, it demonstrated that pets with cancer can be a good representation of human disease and that &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/scotland/article/drug-trial-in-dogs-aims-to-fast-track-cancer-care-for-humans-b398pd8rz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;clinical trials in pets&lt;/a&gt; may yield more reliable results than tests in mouse models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cats live in the same environments as their owners, are exposed to the same pathogens and develop spontaneous cancers that mirror human disease far more closely than those artificially produced in mice. “Their tumours are much more heterogeneous [made up of a mix of different cell types, rather than uniform], which makes them a better mimic of human disease,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jak’s owner, Tina Thomas, explained why she chose to take part in the trial as she remembered the gut punch of his diagnosis. “We wanted more time with him. When I found out about this clinical trial, I knew I wanted him to be a part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jak had weekly treatments for one month. During that time his symptoms — primarily a watery eye — greatly improved. He ultimately lived more than eight months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Thomas said: “It was meaningful to us because he was here in our lives.

Reporting of illnesses caused by &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Shigella, Vibrio, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt; is now optional, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;amp;taid=68add0b9b2316600014ce6de&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, which cited a set of CDC talking points that suggested reduced federal funding for FoodNet was the reason for the move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and select counties in California and New York. A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health told CIDRAP News that all eight pathogens are covered by the state's infectious disease reporting rule, which means that all providers in the state are still required to report cases to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Health Department told NBC News that it will also continue tracking all eight pathogens regardless of the changes to FoodNet. But Colorado health officials said they may have to cut back on surveillance activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a query from CIDRAP News, an HHS spokesperson said in an email that FoodNet is focusing on &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC because they are among the top five contributors to foodborne illnesses and related hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. The official added that the CDC has different surveillance systems that track infections caused by the other pathogens, and that narrowing FoodNet's reporting requirements will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Active, population-based surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FoodNet has been around since 1995 and was created in the wake of the 1992-93 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; O157:H7 outbreak linked to Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers. &lt;/span&gt;According to Craig Hedberg, PhD, &lt;span&gt;a professor in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Minnesota and codirector of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence, it was built using the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites, which conducts population-based surveillance for a range of infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The idea was to perform active surveillance for seven foodborne pathogens that would be commonly diagnosed by clinical laboratories that served the populations in the FoodNet site catchment areas," Hedberg explained, with FoodNet auditing the labs to ensure that all diagnosed illnesses caused by the pathogens were reported. (An eighth pathogen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyclospora,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; was added in 1997).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food poisoning is a common cause of illness in the United States. According to the CDC, which bases its estimates on FoodNet surveillance, 48 million American get sick from a foodborne illness each year. Although most people recover from foodborne disease without requiring medical attention, 128,000 are hospitalized annually, and 3,000 die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and STEC are leading causes of foodborne illness in the United States, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are also common culprits. According to the CDC, 1.5 million Americans are sickened by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; each year, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant....In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2024 outbreak of listeriosis linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/listeria/listeria-outbreak-tied-deli-meats-grows-death-toll-reaches-9"&gt;Boar's Head deli meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; sickened at least 61 people in 19 states and was suspected in 10 deaths. A more recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; outbreak tied to packaged, pre-cooked meals has caused 17 illnesses and 3 deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It is especially heartbreaking to know that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is one of the pathogens that will not be tracked through FoodNet," said public health and veterinary consultant Gail Hansen, DVM, MPH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though states can continue to monitor for infections caused by all eight pathogens, Hansen said she's concerned that reduced FoodNet surveillance could hamper the ability to catch and notify the public about foodborne disease outbreaks before they spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The beauty of FoodNet was that it collected and coordinated information from all the states about germs that make us sick and quickly communicated it to everyone," she said. "Despite what the current HHS administration believes, ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. States do not have the ability to coordinate information and data across states, and this cut will bring us back to a time before FoodNet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foundation of the food safety system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hedberg noted that other CDC programs, like PulseNet, FoodCORE, and the Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence, are more actively focused on foodborne outbreak detection and investigation. But he warned that a loss of funding for these programs "would devastate our capacity to investigate outbreaks." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, Hedberg worries about the signal being sent by scaling back FoodNet surveillance efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant," he said. "In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Upon closer inspection, it seems to come down to vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3—so, which should you choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: Diane Han, M.P.H., R.D.N., L.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist based in San Francisco and the founder of &lt;a href="https://wokingbalancewellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woking Balance Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woking Balance Wellness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, dietitians share the differences between vitamin D2 and vitamin D3, plus why you might want to take one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays many essential roles in the body. “It is important for keeping our bones strong by aiding the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus. It also supports our immune system, keeps our muscles functioning properly, and has some anti-inflammatory properties,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up. Yet as important as vitamin D is, it can be difficult to get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no superior way to get vitamin D. Getting vitamin D from a variety of sources is preferred,” says Diane Han, M.P.H., R.D.N., L.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist based in San Francisco and the founder of &lt;a href="https://wokingbalancewellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woking Balance Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woking Balance Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’re one of the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:35% of adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;35% of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States who are &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g65454297/vitamin-d-deficiency-side-effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:deficient in vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;deficient in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, a supplement may be a useful source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four different &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65810599/ways-to-get-more-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ways to get vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ways to get vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements-vitamin-d%2Fart-20363792&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The first is that the body can make vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin. The second is to get it from foods in which it naturally occurs, and the third is to consume it via foods that have been fortified with vitamin D. The fourth, then, is to take a vitamin D supplement, which contains two subtypes: D2 and D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamins D2 and D3 are used similarly in the body,” says Han. Both need to be converted in the body to calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D, or the form that your cells can actually use. Calcitriol is available as a prescription medication, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682335.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine;&lt;/a&gt; it's used to treat low calcium and bone disease in patients with kidney or parathyroid dysfunction. But if you are looking to supplement with vitamin D, you'll be choosing between one of these two inactive forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few key differences between D2 and D3, namely where they come from and how effective they are at improving vitamin D levels in the body (D3 seems to be slightly better in this department—more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D2 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D2, also called ergocalciferol, comes mainly from plant sources and fungi such as mushrooms. Interestingly, when mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or UV light, they produce D2,” says Bakovic. She adds that D2 is also added to some foods, the most common of which are dairy, soy, almond, and rice milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese, and orange juice, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D2 is what is considered an inactive form of vitamin D, which means the body must transform it before being able to utilize it. “Once in your body, D2 is converted in the liver to a form called calcidiol, and then subsequently in the kidneys to calcitriol, which is the active form of D,” Bakovic explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D2 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After vitamin D2 is converted to the active form of vitamin D, the body can then use it for the processes mentioned above, such as reinforcing bones and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65797024/boost-immune-system-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strengthening the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strengthening the immune system&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D2 may also be used in treatment plans for hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands), vitamin D-resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus in the blood), in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65403333/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D3 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65802092/what-vitamin-d3-does-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin D3;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, or cholecalciferol, is another inactive form of vitamin D. Its sources include skin exposure to sunlight and animal-based foods such as salmon, sardines, egg yolks, and liver,” says Han. Similar to D2, D3 needs to go through a conversion process before the body is able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D3 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There aren’t any specific processes that require D3 exclusively,” says Bakovic. “However, because it’s more bioavailable [meaning it enters the circulation and is able to impact the body], it is usually more effective in the prevention and/or correction of a Vitamin D deficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the key way in which vitamin D3 differs from D2. A 2024 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)01394-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Advances in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;analyzed 20 studies that compared the efficacy of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3 for raising the levels of vitamin D in the body and found that vitamin D3 was better at raising total vitamin D concentration in the blood. However, the researchers also found that when they looked at the concentration of hydroxylated (or active) vitamin D, the difference between D2 and D3 was negligible, especially in people who were taking it daily. So while D3 supplements do appear to be more bioavailable, both forms of vitamin D can be effective for combating vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin D3 has been shown to be more effective at raising vitamin D levels when they are low, both D3 and D2 are easily converted in the body into the active, usable form we need to support key processes and optimize health. Still, the best thing to do before deciding which one to take is to talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if you can safely take vitamin D (it may interact with some medications and shouldn’t be taken if you have certain other medical problems, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;) and how much to take to get the benefits you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing.

							&lt;p data-start="706" data-end="727"&gt;We’ve all met them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The 72-year-old who seems to carry light around with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The woman at the farmer’s market with laugh lines and glowing skin who looks like she’s aging in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The grandfather who’s more energetic than his thirtysomething kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="965" data-end="1044"&gt;Yes, genetics matter. But psychology suggests there’s more going on than DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1046" data-end="1255"&gt;People who remain radiant and youthful into their 70s tend to share a set of daily practices that shape not only how they look, but how they carry themselves, how they connect, and how they radiate vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1257" data-end="1293"&gt;Here are eight of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1300" data-end="1352"&gt;1. They reframe stress instead of stewing in it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Stress ages us faster than sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Cortisol, the stress hormone, has been linked to wrinkles, inflammation, and even memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;The youthful 70-somethings you meet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;They’re not stress-free—they’re stress-resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Psychologically, they practice &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-reappraisal"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1617" data-end="1640"&gt;cognitive reappraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: reframing challenges as temporary, manageable, or even meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Instead of spiraling over a rude comment, they’ll shrug and think, &lt;em data-start="1776" data-end="1798"&gt;That’s not about me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1802" data-end="1948"&gt;It doesn’t erase problems, but it changes their body’s reaction. Less cortisol means less wear-and-tear. And less wear-and-tear means more glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1950" data-end="2055"&gt;So while others stew in negativity, they’ve mastered the art of letting go—and it shows on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2062" data-end="2098"&gt;2. They stay socially connected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2100" data-end="2222"&gt;Loneliness doesn’t just hurt feelings—it hurts health. Studies show chronic loneliness can age cells as much as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;The radiant elders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;They cultivate community. Weekly walks with neighbors. Standing phone calls with old friends. Joining choirs, gardening clubs, or book groups—not to kill time, but to nurture connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;em data-start="2456" data-end="2476"&gt;social integration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;It feeds emotional needs, buffers stress, and keeps the brain sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Even small interactions—a chat with the cashier, a wave to the mail carrier—stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Over decades, they create a net of belonging that protects against isolation’s aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2733" data-end="2830"&gt;Youthfulness is contagious, and these people make sure they’re always plugged into the current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2837" data-end="2884"&gt;3. They move their bodies daily—but gently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;We often assume youthful people are the ones grinding it out in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;But many radiant elders aren’t lifting heavy—they’re simply moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3030" data-end="3143"&gt;Morning stretches. Daily walks. Gardening, dancing, swimming, yoga. Activities that feel joyful, not punishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;Psychology explains this through &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/attitude-behavior-consistency"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3178" data-end="3202"&gt;behavioral consistency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: when exercise is enjoyable, people stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;When it’s punishing, they quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3287" data-end="3385"&gt;The result is decades of circulation, mobility, and energy—not burned-out joints and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3387" data-end="3518"&gt;They don’t obsess over “fitness.” They weave movement into daily life like it’s brushing their teeth. And the glow is cumulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3525" data-end="3557"&gt;4. They cultivate curiosity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3559" data-end="3681"&gt;There’s something unmistakable about a 70-year-old who still leans forward in conversation, eyes bright, eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Youthfulness isn’t just physical—it’s mental flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-openness-influences-your-behavior-4796351"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3765" data-end="3789"&gt;openness to experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the willingness to try new things, learn, and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;People who age radiantly often read widely, ask questions, explore new hobbies, and stay culturally curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;They don’t get stuck in &lt;em data-start="3981" data-end="4012"&gt;this is how it’s always been.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4016" data-end="4134"&gt;Curiosity keeps neural pathways active. It creates novelty, which sparks dopamine, which keeps mood and energy high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4136" data-end="4261"&gt;In short: they stay young because they stay interested. And people who are interested in life remain interesting to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4268" data-end="4312"&gt;5. They practice gratitude like hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4314" data-end="4418"&gt;Bitterness is heavy. It furrows brows, stiffens posture, and makes people look older than their years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;Radiant 70-somethings tend to practice gratitude daily—not as a grand gesture, but as a micro-habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;A pause over coffee. A whispered thank-you after a phone call. A nightly reflection on what went right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Psychology shows &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/"&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt; shifts attention toward abundance rather than lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Over time, this fosters optimism, which is strongly linked to resilience and even longer lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4809" data-end="4941"&gt;You can see it on their faces: softened lines, relaxed eyes, a kind of ease that comes from choosing appreciation over resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4943" data-end="5011"&gt;Gratitude isn’t just good manners. It’s anti-aging for the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5018" data-end="5064"&gt;6. They prioritize sleep like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5066" data-end="5189"&gt;We glorify busyness in younger decades, but by 70, the wise ones know: nothing steals glow faster than sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Psychologists emphasize the link between &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-19400-1"&gt;sleep and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Without rest, people grow irritable, anxious, and more prone to stress—all of which accelerate aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;Radiant elders treat sleep as non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;They keep routines, respect bedtime, and protect their rest the way others protect their bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5522" data-end="5618"&gt;This consistency shows up in clearer skin, steadier moods, sharper minds, and better immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5620" data-end="5726"&gt;They don’t brag about “getting by” on five hours. They brag about eight—and the glow that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5733" data-end="5757"&gt;7. They laugh—a lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It sounds simple, but laughter is medicine with measurable effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It reduces stress hormones, boosts immune function, and strengthens social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;Youthful elders aren’t humorless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;They find reasons to laugh daily—through comedy, friends, silly stories, or simply not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6179"&gt;Psychologists frame this as &lt;em data-start="6097" data-end="6125"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2847490/"&gt;positive affect regulatio&lt;/a&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;: deliberately seeking joy to counterbalance stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6297"&gt;Wrinkles from frowning deepen tension. Wrinkles from laughter deepen warmth. And everyone prefers the second kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6414"&gt;If you want to look youthful at 70, stop worrying about the laugh lines—and start worrying if you don’t have any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6421" data-end="6449"&gt;8. They nurture purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6451" data-end="6532"&gt;Perhaps the most underrated habit: they have a reason to get up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;a href="https://kyoseiconsulting.com/ikigai-and-aging-well/"&gt;&lt;em data-start="6556" data-end="6564"&gt;ikigai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese culture—a sense of life purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Whether it’s volunteering, mentoring, gardening, or simply being the glue of their family, radiant elders keep contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6738" data-end="6849"&gt;Purpose provides motivation, structure, and meaning. It keeps them mentally engaged and emotionally grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6851" data-end="6964"&gt;Without purpose, days feel flat and repetitive. With purpose, days feel alive—and that energy radiates outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6966" data-end="7036"&gt;They don’t just live long. They live well. And that makes them glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7043" data-end="7066"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;Looking youthful into your 70s isn’t about chasing trends or obsessing over wrinkle creams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;It’s about psychology—the small, consistent ways we frame our lives, regulate our emotions, and nurture our connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;The elders who glow are rarely the ones who “had it easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;Many faced hardships, losses, health scares. But instead of letting those experiences calcify into bitterness, they turned them into wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7487" data-end="7581"&gt;And that’s the secret: youthfulness isn’t the absence of age. It’s the presence of vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7588" data-end="7608"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7610" data-end="7695"&gt;Radiance at 70 doesn’t come from erasing the years. It comes from living them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7880"&gt;The habits are deceptively simple—gratitude, laughter, movement, connection—but over decades, they carve out something more powerful than perfect skin: a spirit that refuses to dim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8026"&gt;And when you meet someone who carries that kind of light, you don’t think about their age. You just think, &lt;em data-start="7989" data-end="8024"&gt;I want to glow like that someday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Inside every human brain lies a detailed map of the body, with different regions dedicated to different body parts – the hands, lips, feet and more. But what happens to this map when a body part is removed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1929/6206526"&gt;scientists believed&lt;/a&gt; that when a body part is amputated, the brain's body map dramatically reorganises itself, with neighbouring body parts taking over the area once represented by the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of large-scale brain reorganisation became a central pillar of what neuroscientists call adult brain plasticity: the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injuries, new experiences or training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-medieval-italian-man-replaced-his-amputated-hand-with-a-knife"&gt;This Medieval Italian Man Replaced His Amputated Hand With a Knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows the opposite is true: the brain's body map remains strikingly stable, even years after amputation.&lt;br&gt;
To test what happens in the brain after a person loses a body part, we took a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with NHS surgeons, we followed three adult patients who were preparing to undergo lifesaving arm amputations for medical reasons, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or severe problems with blood supply. We scanned their brains with functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) before the amputation and repeatedly afterwards – in some cases for as long as five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the MRI scans, we asked patients to move different body parts: tapping their individual fingers, curling their toes or pursing their lips. This allowed us to map brain activity and to construct the brain's body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, we repeated the scans, this time asking them to move their missing (phantom) fingers. Phantom movements are not imaginary: most amputees continue to feel vivid sensations of their missing limbs, even though they are physically no longer there. Doing so gave us a rare opportunity to directly compare the brain's hand map before and after amputation in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that, across all three patients, the map of the hand in the brain remained remarkably unchanged and did not get overwritten by other body parts, such as the face. This neural stability helps explain why so many amputees continue to feel their missing limbs so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most amputees, however, phantom sensations are not neutral sensations; they are painful and described as burning, stabbing or itching. For years, the dominant explanation for these painful sensations came from the idea that the brain's body map has reorganised itself. In turn, this theory inspired therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPxKr1dMU0"&gt;mirror box therapy&lt;/a&gt;, virtual reality training, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplcT2MjuEc"&gt;sensory-discrimination exercises&lt;/a&gt;, all aimed at fixing supposedly broken maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mirror-box therapy explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show the brain's body map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; broken. This helps explain why these therapies consistently fail to outperform  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatments in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. If the map remains intact, trying to fix it is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, our results suggest we should look elsewhere, for example, in the nerves that are cut during surgery. Severed nerves can form tangled clusters that misfire signals back to the brain. New amputation surgical techniques are being developed to preserve nerve signalling and maintain stable connections to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings have important implications for developing prosthetic limbs and brain-computer interfaces. Invasive next-generation brain-computer interfaces can tap directly into the preserved map of the amputated body part to decode what movements are being attempted or even deliver electrical stimulation to the map to enable amputees to feel their missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technologies are in development and could, one day, restore natural and intuitive control and sensations of a prosthetic limb, by using the preserved body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that our brains have a resilient model of the body that maintains the representations, even when the sensory input is lost. For amputees, this means that the missing limb lives on in the brain, sometimes as a source of discomfort, but also as a resource for future technologies to use.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263547/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic was supposed to serve as a wake-up call, making the value of scientific expertise, medical research, and public-health preparedness impossible to ignore, let alone deny. But the opposite has happened in the US, and Donald Trump and his supporters bear much of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div dir="ltr" class="article__body article__body--commentary  english" itemprop="articleBody" data-page-area="article-body"&gt;
                            &lt;p data-line-id="e0f9bfb8882542108aee4909d4c9717e"&gt; CAMBRIDGE – US President William McKinley died in 1901 from gunshot wounds that modern medicine could easily have treated. Though X-rays had been invented, they were not yet widely available, so McKinley’s medical team were unable to find one of the assassin’s bullets. And the antibiotics that could have prevented the onset of sepsis – McKinley’s ultimate cause of death – would not be discovered for another few decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="a6e2ed9e9adf457fba3e14e818b3bc41"&gt; When US President Donald Trump talks about making America great again, this is the period to which he is referring. McKinley was a “strong believer in tariffs,” Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5272753/why-trump-loves-former-president-mckinley-so-much"&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt;, and under his leadership, the United States was “probably the wealthiest” it has been at any point in its history. As usual, however, Trump gets both the history and the economics wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="259fee5cd7b6419cb690e1cf30b10f0d"&gt; For starters, the McKinley Tariff was &lt;a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/tariff-1890-mckinley-tariff-5869/fulltext"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, when its namesake was a representative. During his presidency, which began seven years later, McKinley turned against tariffs. Moreover, although it was the height of the Gilded Age, all was not golden for Americans. &lt;a href="https://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.com/2012/09/us-real-per-capita-gdp-from-18702001.html"&gt;Real incomes&lt;/a&gt; were one-seventh of their size today, and extreme inequality &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carnegie-gilded/"&gt;prevailed&lt;/a&gt;. Something like 1% of American households had indoor toilets in 1890, compared to 99% today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="7bbee0932103495fb1ba845d1c7005a8"&gt; Needless to say, health outcomes have improved dramatically since McKinley’s day. US &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041693/united-states-all-time-child-mortality-rate/"&gt;child mortality&lt;/a&gt; has plummeted from 23.9% in 1890 to 0.7% today, and average &lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/nchs/2020/11/20/7035/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; at birth has soared from 47 to 77 years. We owe this progress largely to improvements in sanitation and advances in science and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-line-id="27fcf0254e8b45878a9f5dbe13cbb49b"&gt; Consider the impact of vaccination. Since Max Theiler, a South African immigrant, developed a yellow-fever vaccine in 1937, the disease has been eradicated in the US and many other countries. After Pearl Kendrick and Grace Eldering developed their pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine in 1939, deaths from that disease declined sharply. Since Jonas Salk developed his &lt;a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/6QWhgYkCnslptw"&gt;polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, followed by the Polish immigrant Albert Sabin’s oral vaccine in 1960, the disease has been eradicated in all but a handful of countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="ab4c463e720d4ec8b064460fc8b6fef3"&gt; Measles is another example here. It was once a leading cause of child mortality in the US. In 2000, it was declared eliminated in the US and sharply suppressed in the rest of the world, thanks to a vaccine introduced in 1963. Vaccines against smallpox, typhoid fever, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, and the flu have saved countless lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="listing special asize inlay special--generic" data-message-area="promotion-Commentary" data-page-subarea="promotion-subscription" dir="ltr" lang="en-us"&gt;

&lt;p data-line-id="123af0ab6aaf47dc9e27326e6a0dbb94"&gt; And then there is the COVID-19 vaccine – a true triumph of modern science. Building on &lt;a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/why-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research-catastrophic-mistake"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; breakthroughs, the vaccines were developed in under a year, and &lt;a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/virus-vaccination-and-voting"&gt;they averted&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 14-20 million deaths in their first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/"&gt;12 months&lt;/a&gt;. This achievement was made possible, in part, by the work of immigrants: Hungarian-born Katalin Karikó, Lebanese-born Noubar Afeyan, and French-born Stéphane Bancel at Moderna, and Indian-born Nita Patel, who led Novavax’s vaccine team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="213d6a980e894ab3a30892dfa8d26123"&gt; Taken together, vaccines have saved at least &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years"&gt;154 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over the last half-century, and they continue to save an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/immunization"&gt;4-5 million lives&lt;/a&gt; per year. And this is to say nothing of the myriad other life-saving advances in diagnostics and treatment that have emerged in the 124 years since McKinley was shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="1d1137430cc8473ca5fe33c1cd81510b"&gt; Trump is now threatening to unravel this progress. His administration has &lt;a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10497981"&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/3032216/foreign-aid-the-powerful-us-soft-power-is-gone"&gt;foreign aid&lt;/a&gt; and balked at international cooperation in the name of “America First.” And now he has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the director of the Centers for Disease Control because she refused to endorse Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s anti-vaccine policies. But by enabling the resurgence of diseases that have been brought under control, and hampering progress in tackling others, Trump is indirectly jeopardizing Americans’ health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="d491414e0ccd40e5893d84d999a1a086"&gt; Trump is also mounting direct attacks on their health at home. His administration has all but declared war on universities, hospitals, public-health agencies, and other non-profit science-based institutions. Funding for vital medical research – including grants from the National Institutes of Health – has been sharply reduced or eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="c69975f17ff248678317a5f3b3f881bc"&gt; Trump’s war on universities dovetails with his war on immigrants. As students return to university campuses to begin the new academic year, many desks are empty, because the Trump administration has blocked their would-be occupants from entering the US. Trump is also seeking to make it harder for foreigners to remain in the US after receiving their degrees, despite the long list of scientific breakthroughs to which immigrants have contributed. This is not a brain drain, but a brain squeeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="212b193c170940ecbf267c9265dd4e8d"&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic was supposed to serve as a wake-up call, making the value of scientific expertise, medical research, and public-health preparedness impossible to ignore, let alone deny. But the opposite has happened in the US: trust in science, government, and public institutions has plumbed new lows, owing partly to the MAGA movement’s promotion of health misinformation, conspiracy theories, and mistrust of “the establishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="e775a809123f4f9a8304c137dee9e7f0"&gt; Now, vaccine skepticism is surging, with a growing number of Americans doubting the safety and efficacy not only of the COVID-19 vaccine, but also of the established vaccines that have saved millions of children’s lives and added decades to our lifespans over the last century. Vaccine misinformation of the kind peddled by Kennedy has already contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-019-0354-3"&gt;measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="cc782742762e4e3b85be6398f3e172f2"&gt; One might say that the Trump administration is attempting to turn back the clock on public health to 1900. The question is why. Applying Occam’s razor – the principle that the simplest explanation is the most likely – one can only conclude that the objective and the effect are the same: to increase the number of people suffering and dying from contagious disease. Now &lt;em&gt;there’s&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy theory for the Trump faithful to sink their paranoia into! &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

            Now, researchers are trying to learn how many people have “young COPD,” meaning the condition is diagnosed before 50 years of age. “Young COPD” was present in 4.5% of adults under 50 in the population studied, a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fevidence.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FEVIDoa2400424&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027673942654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=hl3YvrA1ft0R29S5HHFnpjPy8EhltzbCD0GIl16oaVg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;NEJM Evidence&lt;/a&gt;​ found.

            What is COPD, and what are the risk factors for developing this condition? And why might young COPD increase mortality risk? What should people with COPD do to improve their health outcomes?

            To answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

The two most common types of COPD are emphysema, which occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and lose their ability to stretch and exchange oxygen, and chronic bronchitis, which is marked by long-term inflammation and narrowing of the airways, often with excess mucus and a persistent cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who currently smoke or previously smoked have a higher chance of developing COPD.

In addition, individuals with a history of asthma and a family history of COPD are at higher risk for having COPD.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the study authors, previous researchers have used varying definitions of “young COPD.” For instance, some have included only those who have had a smoking history. This study used a more expansive definition to account for nonsmokers with COPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000g3b6ni3l9a371@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, individuals must meet three sets of criteria. The first is having a spirometry measurement showing airflow obstruction. Spirometry is a breathing test that measures how much air a person can exhale and how quickly, which helps determine whether the lungs are blocked or narrowed. The second is having either 10 or more &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdictionaries%2Fcancer-terms%2Fdef%2Fpack-year&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674009427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XQUtwlel9G7Jm2Nj7pcKJzwY8d6t%2FWRGWAF4kJuH8kI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pack years&lt;/a&gt; of smoking, or symptoms of cough, phlegm and trouble breathing. The third is age between 18 and 49 years old.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers examined four groups of people who were already participating in other research studies. This is important because they were not selected based on smoking exposure or existence of respiratory illnesses; therefore, their health characteristics broadly reflected the overall US population. Using this definition, they determined that the prevalence of young COPD was 4.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000j3b6n8fwnljcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers then tracked outcomes of participants with young COPD compared with those without this condition. They found that premature mortality, defined as death before 75 years of age, was increased more than 1.4 times among those with young COPD. The likelihood of hospitalization or death due to chronic lung disease was more than 2.5 times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Making sure to stay up-to-date with vaccinations is essential, as people with COPD are at greater risk of serious illness if they were to contract respiratory illnesses. They should speak with their providers about whether they are &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;up-to-date with vaccines&lt;/a&gt; including streptococcal pneumonia, pertussis, Covid-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The provider may also recommend &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Ftreating%2Fcopd-medications&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674227554%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=HZrKR9MkFJzEj56lVPCeE7qI1DOYFrOXyZ2N%2BQEhGj4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;one or multiple medications&lt;/a&gt; that treat COPD symptoms. These include bronchodilators that relax the airway muscles and anti-inflammatories that reduce inflammation and mucus production. Individuals with COPD should also be alert to early signs of infection. They may receive specific antiviral treatment, and antibiotics are often given if a bacterial infection is suspected since infections can quickly worsen breathing problems.

I developed this horrific electrical pulsating sensation throughout my body, 24/7.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her symptoms worsened and she was soon unable to walk, and for the next four months could not tolerate light, sound or touch. Even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Their voices cut through my brain like a knife,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brianne Dressen, then 39, received a single vaccine dose in AstraZeneca 's Utah trials in November 2020 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told Daily Mail soon that after receiving the vaccine she had trouble walking and began experiencing pain in her arms and legs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In constant agony, she said she contemplated suicide, but with the support of family, the vaccine injured community, and her husband, Dr Brian Dressen, she pulled through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and alleged in her lawsuit that AstraZeneca refused to comply with its contractual obligations to care for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she experiences fatigue, an internal buzzing sensation, weakness in her arms and legs, which means she sometimes needs a wheelchair, tinnitus, nausea, a weak bladder, food allergies and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), an irregular heartbeat and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dressen has a PhD in chemistry and wrote to neurologists trying to find answers for his wife's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he was surprised when neuroimmunology specialist Dr Avindra Nath, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH, replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nath wanted to explore whether Dr Dressen's wife was suffering from a vaccine injury. When he set up a trial to test for Covid vaccine injury, she was the first enrolled in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, the NIH diagnosed Dressen with post-vaccine neuropathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 12 months following her trial vaccination, Dressen says she endured 60 doctors appointments, four emergency department visits, and one hospital admission. She said medical bills began to mount, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told this website she was in so much pain that she contemplated suicide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said her symptoms were so severe even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to AstraZeneca for financial assistance based on the contract she signed, which stated that the trial's 'sponsor will pay the costs of medical treatment for research injuries, provided that the costs are reasonable, and you did not cause the injury yourself.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dressen said AstraZeneca offered only a tiny fraction of the cost to cover expenses. She said they offered to increase the amount if she agreed to absolve them of any future liability. She refused the offers as she said they were derisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has a growing medical bill and is suing AstraZeneca for alleged breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment but filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, so they launched an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the Public Readiness and Preparedness (PREP) Act 2005, was set up to provide immunity to companies making vaccines when a public health emergency has been declared, as was the case during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It prevents the injured from suing unless a lawyer can prove there is evidence of willful misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For serious injury or death caused by emergency use vaccines, people must apply within 12 months for compensation to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) set up in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CICP is a no-fault government program run by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that covers emergency use products, like the Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, then 24, said he developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020 in an AstraZeneca trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It pays for hospital costs not covered by insurance, lost wages up to $50,000, and just over $400,000 for a death, but most claims have been denied. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr criticized the scheme and said: 'It is broken, and I intend to fix it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 1, 2025, the CICP had received 13,836 claims from trial volunteers and citizens for Covid vaccine injuries, with 9,423 still pending review. It has paid just 39, denying 4,338 – with 2,318 rejected because claimants missed the 12-month deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experts agree patients' symptoms should never be dismissed, they stress that they believe Covid vaccine injuries are overall rare and estimate the shots have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccine side effects impact around one in 200,000 people, according to official US data. Approximately 270million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally, including 3million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, however, Yale researchers discovered a syndrome linked to the Covid vaccines. The previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' - appears to cause brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' but based on the results of the small study, more research on post-vaccination syndrome is needed, independent experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another AstraZeneca trial, two British volunteers collapsed, having developed transverse myelitis, a serious nervous system disorder that can cause paralysis. The trials were temporarily halted in September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were restarted six days later in the UK, by mid-September in Brazil, and by October in the US after an investigation determined the vaccine was not to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca also ran a trial at the Federal University of São Paolo, Brazil, with 5,000 volunteers. Student pharmacologist and gym enthusiast, Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, 24, took part and developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A type 1 diabetic, he was deemed fit to take part in the trial, but Souza said he developed Covid-like symptoms after his first dose on October 16, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza is a type 1 diabetic, but he was deemed fit to take part in the trial for AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza said: 'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid tests came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his second injection, he developed encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, and suffered a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza told DailyMail.com: 'My family took me to hospital. I was released after an overnight stay. I went home, had breakfast and went to bed. I collapsed in my bedroom, and my family took me back to hospital. I woke up three weeks later, having been sedated all that time, and spent two months in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While I was in the coma, neurologists investigated whether other viruses or bacteria caused my seizures but found no infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since there was no other identified cause before the vaccination, they requested the unblinding of the vaccine trial and discovered I had not received the placebo, which was the meningitis vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza will need medication for life to control his epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca refused to recognize his injury and provided no medical assistance according to Souza, so in 2021, Souza filed a civil suit in Bahia state court seeking financial compensation for alleged pain, suffering, emotional distress, financial losses and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza is bitter, he said. He told DailyMail.com: 'I was treated like a disposable number.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he met with AstraZeneca's lawyers twice, but they failed to offer a reasonable settlement. AstraZeneca has denied any wrongdoing. The case is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another part of the world for another Covid vaccine, criminal lawyer Augusto Roux, 40, took part in Pfizer's trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and said he suffered a serious adverse reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer conducted its largest Covid vaccine study there, with 5,700 volunteers representing 10 percent of Pfizer's worldwide trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Augusto Roux, then 36, took part in Pfizer's Covid vaccine trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He told the Daily Mail he developed a high fever that persisted for weeks after receiving his second dose of Pfizer's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was run by the Argentine military at Hospital Militar Central – Central Military Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, who was 36 at the time, received his first Pfizer dose in August 2020 with no complications. However, after his second dose the following month, he said he was near death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, sharing the experience he lays out in his complaint, told the Daily Mail: 'I developed a 104-degree Fahrenheit [40C] fever which lasted several weeks; loss of consciousness, and tachycardia that could have killed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage, but trial doctors ignored these symptoms and questioned my mental health. Pfizer did not want to investigate my reaction and suggested I was infected with coronavirus, but all coronavirus tests were negative.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina, Dr Fernando Pedro Polack, who diagnosed Roux's illness as mental health issues. However, Dr Polack is not a mental health provider and is a pediatric infectious disease specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pedro Polack did not respond to Daily Mail's request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux thinks treating his injuries have cost around $150,000 so far, paid for by health insurance, despite a contract with Pfizer that said he would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor David Healy, a pharmacologist trained to assess adverse drug reactions, was one of four doctors who assessed Roux's physical and mental health, at Roux's request. He acted pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'Roux had a significant injury linked to the vaccine and the failure to recognize this in his trial record amounts to a breach of good clinical trial practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It does not appear that Roux's injuries have been registered. If the trial is misleading in Roux's case, in how many other cases of people vaccinated in Buenos Aires has this also been the case?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he now has pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux said: 'I realized that they had deleted records of my adverse events a year later when I accessed my medical records and they weren't there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A criminal case has now been launched by Roux alleging Pfizer, and the officials in charge of the trial, are guilty of abuse of power, failing to protect him, failing in public duty, bribery and corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He alleges the regulatory and judicial authorities suppressed adverse event reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, Argentina's Federal Chamber, similar to the Federal Court of Appeals, requested a formal investigation into trial irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux's investigations led to the Independent Ethics Committee of the Military Hospital (CIREC) being suspended for 90 days on May 20, 2021, by Dr Laura Antonietti, Director of Medical Education and Research, a senior Argentine Ministry of Health Official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also offered to investigate but did not follow through, although they did conduct preliminary enquiries and said they were happy the trial was following good clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Patient safety is paramount and we take any reports of adverse events very seriously. Adverse event reports do not imply causality, and in the context of vaccination such events may be unrelated to administration of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hundreds of millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine remains positive for all authorized indications and age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As with every medicine and vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has robust processes to meet its regulatory responsibilities to closely monitor, report and analyze all adverse events, and collect relevant information to assess any new potential safety risks that may be associated with the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition to our pharmacovigilance efforts and compliance with regulatory requirements related to quality and safety, we also work with regulatory authorities around the world as they independently monitor the safety profile of our vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients who receive the COVID-19 vaccine should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse if they have any concerns or experience any side effects. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the package leaflet.

    &lt;p&gt;We’re firmly still in the summer months but many of us have been struck with symptoms we’d usually associate with the winter – runny noses, dry coughs and fevers. Right now, chances are these symptoms are caused by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of the pandemic-causing virus are among the highest they have been all year. Here, the scientists explain exactly why Covid is on the rise again and, vitally, how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do so many people have Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infection rates always go up because of one of three reasons,” says Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s either because immunity to Covid among the population has fallen; a new and more infectious variant is spreading; or behaviour has changed in a way that increases the risk of exposure to the virus, he explains. All three factors are currently at play, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Immunity against Covid is low&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid cases are no longer being tracked as thoroughly as they were during the pandemic, when tests were dished out for free. However, monitoring shows that cases are currently at their highest level this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures, compiled by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), show that around nine per cent of all Covid tests taken in the week to August 24 were positive, which is the highest level seen since last November. The figures show that 10.8 per cent of people tested in GP practices were infected, while 8.8 per cent of swabs among hospital patients were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reporting rates have been around base levels for almost a year now and so population immunity will be relatively low,” Prof Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming infected with Covid, the immune system develops antibodies against it. These are fighter cells that recognise and neutralise the virus when the body comes into contact with it again. “Immunity to infection probably lasts only a few months on average,” Prof Hunter notes, after which point the body is once again vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that is probably the major factor,” fuelling the current upward trend in infections, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The new XFG variant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;XFG, a sub-variant of the once infamous Omicron, was first &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; in January. This strain of the virus, which has been nicknamed Stratus, is currently responsible for that majority of Covid cases in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is also responsible for around 60 per cent of Covid cases globally, according to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/summary"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is actively monitoring XFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has become dominant because it is more infectious (able to bypass existing immunity to some degree) than prior variants,” explains Prof Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But its relative growth advantage is only about 31 per cent, which is not great compared to many previous variants,” he notes. For comparison, the Omicron variant, which caused chaos when it swept the world in late 2021, had a growth advantage of around 200 per cent when it emerged. “So it will be contributing to the growth in cases but I suspect not the main driver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Covid infections are now asymptomatic in many people, there have been reports that an XFG infection may be more likely to cause a hoarse, scratchy or raspy voice. Other common symptoms are still a cough, fever and change of taste or smell, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen the comments on hoarseness but given we see and diagnose such a small proportion of infections now and then usually only the more severe cases, I am not convinced,” Prof Hunter says. “Also adenoviruses [a cause of the common cold] are almost as common in lab tests and they do cause hoarseness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Summer socialising, travel and schools reopening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer events, such as festivals and large gatherings like weddings, are “inevitably contributing” to the rise in cases, according to Prof Peter Openshaw, a respiratory physician and mucosal immunologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased foreign travel during the school holidays will also be contributing to the increase,” Prof Hunter adds. His &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299714"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked travelling abroad with an increased risk of catching Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, looking back over the pattern of transmissions, it does seem that maybe going back to school could be associated with a rise,” Prof Openshaw notes. Schools opening in early September could further encourage the spread of the virus, meaning that, by October, cases are even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that during October we’re going to be seeing a lot more Covid around,” he says. “There was quite a peak in October 2024 and then it settled around Christmas time and was replaced by influenza. It could be that we’re going to see more cases but I think we’ll have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big question is how high will reporting levels go and when they will peak,” Prof Hunter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to avoid it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of isolating yourself at home, there’s unfortunately no magic bullet that will guarantee that you won’t catch Covid or other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regular hand washing and sanitising communal surfaces, such as trays on aeroplanes and trays, as well as gym equipment can reduce your risk of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us, the need to avoid infection is not as great as we will have had multiple infections by now and most infections are asymptomatic,” Prof Hunter says. “On average in England, we will have had about four infections each by now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older and medically vulnerable people should remain more cautious, he says. “Wear masks if in crowded environments, accept the offer of a vaccine if made and discourage visits from people who are suffering from a respiratory infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid autumn vaccination booster programme launches on October 1. Care home residents, over-75s and anyone aged over six months who is immunocompromised is eligible for the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines that are on offer are extraordinarily effective,” Prof Openshaw says. “If you’re offered a vaccine, I would definitely take it and I personally have taken every offer of the vaccines I’ve been made.” The jab can reduce the likelihood of outbreaks and prevent the virus from causing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What to do if you get Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the most effective way to get over Covid is to rest at home and drink plenty of fluids and remain vigilant for worsening symptoms,” says Dr Adrian Hayter, medical director for clinical policy at the Royal College of General Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the counter medications – paracetamol or ibuprofen – can help alleviate symptoms such as aches, a sore throat or a blocked nose, and increasing airflow by sitting upright and breathing slowly can help with feelings of breathlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small group of people remain eligible for antivirals, which are medicines that stop Covid from growing and spreading through the body, including those who have certain immune conditions, blood disorders or receiving specific cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone has concerns for their health, or if their condition is getting worse or not improving, they should seek health advice to determine whether further treatment is needed,” Dr Hayter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises people with Covid symptoms to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for at least three days, while the infected should steer clear of people who have a weak immune system for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The condition is highly infectious, and some people can be particularly vulnerable to the worst effects, which is why it’s important that we take appropriate measures to avoid transmission,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
