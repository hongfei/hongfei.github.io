(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage medium-level anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of anxiety like a volume knob,” Dr Warrier explains. “It can be at a low level, where it’s almost like a whisper. It can be at a medium level, where you know it’s there. Or it can be at a very high level, where it’s screaming.” For low-level &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, simple techniques like deep breathing or stretching can help. “Even basic practices such as box breathing or slow exhalation can calm your nervous system. In a way, it’s telling your body that you are safe,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When anxiety rises to a medium level, manifesting as restlessness or feeling on edge, Dr Warrier recommends grounding techniques. “Connect with your body’s sensory system. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can taste, and one thing you can smell.&lt;/span&gt; This brings you back to your body and helps you calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other strategies for medium-level anxiety include a quick body scan to check in with each part of your body or taking a walk. “The rhythmic action of walking can also help calm your nervous system,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do during high-level anxiety or panic attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-level anxiety, such as during a panic attack or overwhelming stress, requires a more immediate intervention. “This is where you need a slight shock to reset your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-warns-hands-shaking-slurred-speech-are-signs-of-nervous-system-disorders-5-symptoms-you-should-not-ignore-101761714665596.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="nervous system"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, either by splashing cold water on your face or keeping an ice cube in your mouth. Cold water activates the mammalian dive reflex, which brings down your heart rate, stimulates the vagus nerve, and calms you down,” explains Dr Warrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the intensity of anxiety and using the right technique for each level, it becomes easier to regain control and calm the nervous system. As Dr Warrier notes, “Different levels of anxiety need different tools. The key is to match your response to your body’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

That possibility is inching closer to reality thanks to breakthroughs in regenerative dentistry. In April this year, a team at King’s College London (KCL), in collaboration with Imperial College London, announced that they had engineered a biomaterial scaffold that allows cells to communicate and form tooth-like structures in vitro — a key step toward lab-grown human teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ana Angelova Volponi, director of regenerative dentistry at KCL, said the research could “revolutionise dental care”. The study also notes that while some animals such as sharks and elephants can grow new teeth throughout their lives, humans get only one adult set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Essential dental tips for healthier teeth and gums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if you lose a permanent tooth — whether from decay, trauma or congenital absence — treatment typically involves implants, bridges or dentures. While effective, these rely on synthetic materials, surgical intervention, and often require long-term maintenance. The KCL researchers emphasise that a biologically grown tooth would integrate naturally into the jawbone, with nerves and ligaments intact, behaving like a real tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could reduce the long-term risks of wear, failure, or rejection that come with artificial replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reason To Smile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough lies not in producing a fully-grown tooth yet, but in creating the right laboratory environment for tooth-forming cells to do their work. In earlier experiments, cells placed into scaffolds failed to organise properly because developmental signals arrived all at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, according to ScienceAlert, uses a hydrogel scaffold — a water-rich polymer — that releases signals gradually, mimicking the natural “matrix” in which teeth form. Within this structure, epithelial and mesenchymal cells (derived from mouse embryos for now) were able to interact and begin the early stages of tooth formation. As The Independent reports, scientists are exploring two possible pathways toward clinical use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Transplanting immature tooth-forming cells — a “tooth bud” — into the empty socket and letting it grow naturally; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Growing a full tooth in the lab, then implanting it surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each approach has trade-offs: in-mouth growth could minimise surgery, while lab-grown teeth offer greater control. It’s too early to say which will prove more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What The Advantage Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional fillings and implants come with drawbacks. Fillings can weaken surrounding tooth structures, while implants require drilling and bone anchoring — with risks of rejection, bone loss or limited lifespan. A lab-grown biological tooth, derived from the patient’s own cells, would integrate organically with bone and ligament, potentially remodeling and repairing itself like a natural tooth. Still, the technology isn’t ready for patients. Much of the work remains pre-clinical, using animal or mixed human-mouse models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest KCL study relied on mouse embryo-derived progenitor cells to test the hydrogel scaffold, not yet fully human adult cells, ScienceAlert notes. Experts also point out that engineered teeth currently lack full maturation — they don’t yet have a complete blood-vessel network, nerve supply or fully developed enamel and roots. Elsewhere, researchers in Japan are running early clinical trials of treatments that stimulate natural tooth regrowth in patients born without certain teeth — a different, but complementary, line of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Challenges ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several technical, clinical and ethical hurdles remain. Scientists still need to figure out how a lab-grown tooth could integrate seamlessly with nerves, blood vessels, periodontal ligaments and bone to function like a real one. To avoid rejection, each tooth ideally needs to be grown from the patient’s own cells — a process difficult to scale. And even if perfected, the path from lab to clinic involves years of trials, approvals, manufacturing protocols and cost testing before dentists can routinely offer regrown teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;A Broader Dental Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, tooth regeneration could transform dentistry itself. The field would shift from repairing damage with synthetic materials to restoring natural biology, focusing on prevention and regeneration. Someday, “just grow a new tooth” could replace “book a filling” as a standard line in dental care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though timelines are uncertain, researchers are cautiously optimistic. Some predict that within the next decade, the technology could reach early human trials, starting with simpler, single-tooth cases before expanding to more complex restorations. Either way, the groundwork is being laid for a future where smiles can truly grow back — one cell at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxQaGZ2VzM1MDBtZWVzWVlreWVqbkZPaUdnZ2hSbE5HRlFmdjhSX19iU1BLY0d4SWtidWFkQzhJa1lMV0UtZFBWWEttSC04SlJQUWVwNEJJVVJvTHpYWGxtcGljaVQ3NFZCbTlhMGRfZFhqeVRwZWNhX3VzVXlzVVYwV1JZV3ZpalgwVUhGZmNiRWpjeUdNcnlycTlYRDBIOXg5RFpwN2ZCbTBzTFIwc25EWDZQMjhjS1RGakswVEN5UGNYS3RlRy1wRUtZekJqMEJWNGxCWFJoVXM2MlBObVo1b242b1VnNDNrbERLcXFiUEV5S0FkV1k5Sjl5Zw</guid></item><item><title>威尔逊中学周三因诺如病毒疑似爆发而关闭- ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4</title><link>https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2025/11/19/wilson-middle-school-closes-wednesday-amid-suspected-norovirus-outbreak/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WYANDOTTE, Mich.&lt;/strong&gt;

plague. The same disease that wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century has never been eradicated. It's caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is spread to animals by fleas. A handful of cases are reported in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease spread to the U.S. in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early 1900s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt; likely via an infected rodent on a steamship.

If untreated, the infection can spread to the lungs (pneumonic) or the whole body (septicemic), which is almost always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking, and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present," warned Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County acting director of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is a plague case concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The plague is &lt;a href="https://netec.org/2024/03/25/climate-change-and-infectious-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a vector-borne disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a vector-borne disease&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is transmitted to humans via the bites of infected vectors such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. As the heat-trapping pollution produced by human activity causes global temperatures to rise, it creates the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A warmer planet means longer breeding seasons for vectors and extends their ranges.

For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world’s leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A systematic review of 104 long-term studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conducted for the series&lt;/a&gt; found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his colleagues in Brazil came up with the Nova classification system for foods. It groups them by level of processing, ranging from one – unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables – to four: ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This category is made up of products that have been industrially manufactured, often using artificial flavours, emulsifiers and colouring. They include soft drinks and packaged snacks, and tend to be extremely palatable and high in calories but low in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also designed and marketed to displace fresh food and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits, Monteiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics argue UPF is an ill-defined category and existing health policies, such as those aimed at reducing sugar and salt consumption, are sufficient to deal with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Monteiro and his co-authors acknowledged valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPF – such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, they argued future research must not delay immediate action to tackle the scourge of UPF, which they say is justified by the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” Monteiro warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/uk-government-drops-healthy-eating-push-after-lobbying-by-ultra-processed-food-firms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive marketing and political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second paper in the series proposes policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing and consumption. Although some countries have brought in rules to reformulate foods and control UPF, “the global public health response is still nascent, akin to where the tobacco control movement was decades ago”, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The third paper says that global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPF. UPF is a leading cause of the “chronic disease pandemic” linked to diet, with food companies putting profit above all else, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The main barrier to protecting health is “corporate political activities, coordinated transnationally through a global network of front groups, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research partners, to counter opposition and block regulation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Series co-author Prof Barry Popkin, from the University of North Carolina, said: “We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also proposed stronger marketing restrictions, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/22/uk-ban-on-junk-food-adverts-targeting-children-is-delayed-until-next-year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adverts aimed at children, as well as banning UPF in public places such as schools&lt;/a&gt; and hospitals and putting limits on UPF sales and shelf space in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One success story is Brazil’s national school food programme, which has eliminated most UPF and will require 90% of food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists not involved in the series broadly welcomed the review of evidence but also called for more research into UPF, cautioning that association with health harm may not mean causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQYTY2WWw2Yi00SlJfSllFS09FajVTSGpDX29pMDlQd2JCMy1pMXpiQ2J0NnFuVzZfNE5FcW81WlU3M3JtYUpaWW9ram1ub0RjNy1kNloxU1JJOG9jSy1XRXNLWGNjMURBa3l2S1BkdXRUeXVGOEZQdU4wZDVLU05OYXFqaFpkRGVKT0laUDczRmEzRWxoY0E1NzhDZW5BODQwWEd5S1JSYl90UEwwWkQ2dUlUazUzVEFXWFVvSmFPdw</guid></item><item><title>维生素D过量如何导致肾脏损伤：需要注意的6个症状-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-vitamin-d-overdose-leads-to-kidney-damage-6-symptoms-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/125418369.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and immune function by helping the body effectively absorb calcium. However, the recent surge in supplement use has amplified the risk of overdosing (hypervitaminosis D), often occurring when people take high doses without medical oversight. The primary danger lies in the resulting hypercalcaemia, excessive calcium in the blood. The kidneys are forced to filter this overload, causing calcium to deposit in their tissues, a condition known as nephrocalcinosis. This prolonged strain can severely damage the filtering units, leading to acute kidney injury or irreversible failure. Recognising the subtle warning signs is vital, as early symptoms like nausea, persistent thirst, and frequent urination signal a critical electrolyte imbalance and escalating risk to renal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vitamin D overdose affects the kidneys&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive vitamin D intake forces the kidneys to filter high amounts of calcium over prolonged periods. This can cause calcium to deposit in the kidney tissue, gradually forming kidney stones or permanent calcium deposits, a condition called nephrocalcinosis. Over time, this overload may damage the kidneys’ filtering units, resulting in acute kidney injury or, in severe cases, irreversible kidney failure. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206014/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a case study documented in the Journal of Renal Injury Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin D intoxication (overdose) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury and can result not only from self-administration but also from dispensing or prescribing errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Chronic hypercalcemia can also affect other organs, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications and disturbances in electrolyte balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common symptoms of vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting: Excess vitamin D raises calcium levels in the blood, which can irritate the stomach and digestive tract. This often leads to persistent nausea and episodes of vomiting, which are among the earliest signs of overdose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent thirst and frequent urination: High vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), forcing the kidneys to work harder to remove it. This results in frequent urination and intense thirst as the body tries to maintain fluid balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness and fatigue: Elevated calcium levels affect muscle function, leading to general weakness and fatigue. Even routine activities may feel more exhausting, and muscles may feel sore or unusually tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion and cognitive issues: Excess vitamin D can impact the nervous system, causing symptoms like confusion, poor concentration, or disorientation. These cognitive effects may be subtle at first but can worsen if the overdose continues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower back or side pain: Pain in the lower back or sides may indicate that the kidneys are under stress. High calcium levels can cause kidney stones or impair kidney function, resulting in discomfort in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling in the legs and difficulty breathing: In severe cases, prolonged vitamin D overdose can cause kidney damage, leading to fluid retention. This may present as swelling in the legs and ankles, as well as shortness of breath due to fluid buildup, which are serious warning signs of potential kidney failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do adults need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, most adults require only a small amount of vitamin D daily, typically ranging from 400 to 1,000 international units (IU). Regular intake above 4,000 IU can push levels into a potentially harmful range, especially when extremely high doses of 8,000–12,000 IU are taken consistently over months or years. Another common cause of overdose is the accidental daily consumption of high-dose vitamin D capsules that are intended for weekly use, such as 60,000 IU capsules. Excess vitamin D leads to the accumulation of calcium in the blood, a condition known as hypercalcaemia. This excess calcium must be filtered through the kidneys, which can strain their delicate structures and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdose usually occurs when supplements are taken without proper medical guidance, when multiple products containing vitamin D are used simultaneously, or when high-dose injections are administered without regulation. To avoid complications, vitamin D should be taken only if recommended by a healthcare professional. It is important not to exceed prescribed doses, even if higher amounts seem beneficial. Individuals taking long-term supplements should also undergo periodic blood tests to monitor vitamin D and calcium levels. This helps ensure the body is receiving an adequate but safe amount, minimising the risk of kidney damage and other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is undeniably important for health, but more is not always better. Careful use under medical supervision ensures the benefits of supplementation while preventing potential harm. Proper guidance, regular monitoring, and awareness of the symptoms of overdose can protect the kidneys and other organs from the adverse effects of excessive vitamin D. By following these precautions, individuals can safely support bone strength, immunity, and overall well-being without risking long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201694" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3 in 2,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are born with auditory impairments. The good news is that popping a Viagra could come with a surprising perk beyond the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/192090" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a mutation in a gene called CPD, which results in a form of deafness known as sensorineural hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Chicago, the University of Miami and several institutions in Turkey uncovered that the condition could be targeted by two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One is a common supplement, while the other is the popular erectile dysfunction drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study is exciting because we found a new gene mutation that’s linked to deafness, and more importantly, we have a therapeutic target that can actually mitigate this condition,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://neurology.uchicago.edu/faculty/rong-zhai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rong Grace Zhai&lt;/a&gt;, a neurological diseases professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One treatment was sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra and other&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" rel="nofollow" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt; ED medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In healthy hearing, the CPD gene instructs an enzyme to maintain levels of the amino acid arginine, which produces nitric oxide, helping send signals through the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the CPD gene pathway is disrupted, causing oxidative stress and cell death in the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear hair cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for hearing and balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the ear loses the function of the CPD gene, the ability to detect sound waves goes too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors addressed this loss in two ways using fruit flies with CPD mutations: sildenafil to stimulate nitric oxide production and a separate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/vitamin-supplements-could-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-doctor/"&gt;arginine supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Both treatments improved hearing loss in the flies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that CPD maintains the level of arginine in the hair cells to allow a quick signaling cascade by generating nitric oxide,” Zhai explained. “These hair cells in particular are more sensitive or vulnerable to the loss of CPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids and cochlear implants, though the initial study results may lead to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found a promising therapeutic avenue for these patients,” said Zhai. “It is a good example of our efforts to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for treating rare diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unsurprising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 9171 subtype “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” David Sugerman, who leads the CDC measles response, said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, local health officials are pessimistic that they’ll be able to stamp out the virus’ spread, saying that vaccination efforts have had “limited” impact. As Ars reported previously, vaccination rates are dangerously low in two measles hotspots: northwestern Mohave County, Arizona, and the southwest health district of Utah. Vaccination rates among kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year were 78.4 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively. That’s well below the 95 percent target needed to keep the virus from spreading onward in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, public health officials in Arizona and Utah have reported barriers to responding to the outbreak. Around a quarter of cases don’t know how they were exposed, suggesting cases and exposures are being missed. In late October, health officials in Salt Lake County, Utah, said that a person likely infected with measles &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/"&gt;refused to cooperate&lt;/a&gt; with their investigation, leaving them unable to confirm the probable case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review, told the Times, “It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the CDC  has tallied 1,723 measles cases across 42 states. Most (87 percent) of those cases were linked to outbreaks, of which there have been 45 this year. For context, there were 16 outbreaks and a total of 285 measles cases in the US last year. This year’s measles cases mark a 33-year high.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28. He told DailyMail.com if he had not had routine bloodwork done for baseball, he may not have been diagnosed 'until it was too late'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key example researchers found pertained to two beneficial bacterial species, which survived in a test tube when exposed to the antifungal drug bifonazole. The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has uncovered microscopic abnormalities in the blood of long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients&lt;/strong&gt; that may help explain the condition’s lingering symptoms. These hidden structures, discovered through advanced imaging techniques, show a significant departure from typical blood composition. The findings could reshape how we understand and diagnose long COVID. And if confirmed, they might finally provide a tangible target for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microclots And Immune Webs: Unseen Triggers Behind Lingering Illness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the hunt for what fuels &lt;strong&gt;long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;—a condition that continues to puzzle scientists years after the pandemic began—a team of international researchers has turned its attention to the blood. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reveal that people suffering from long COVID consistently show an unusually high presence of two little-known but potentially harmful agents: &lt;em&gt;microclots&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neutrophil extracellular traps&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;NETs&lt;/em&gt;. These substances, although naturally occurring, appear to become harmful when they accumulate and interact in excessive or abnormal ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are not the types of blood clots you’d see in a stroke or pulmonary embolism,” explains Dr. Alain Thierry, lead author of the study and a geneticist at &lt;strong&gt;Montpellier University&lt;/strong&gt; in France. Instead, they are much smaller—microscopic in fact—yet significant enough to disrupt blood flow in tiny vessels, particularly in areas like the brain, muscles, and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used &lt;strong&gt;imaging flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy&lt;/strong&gt; on blood samples from 50 long COVID patients and 38 healthy individuals. They found that microclots were nearly 20 times more abundant in those with long COVID—and, more surprisingly, that NETs were not just floating freely, but were physically embedded within the microclots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They propose that this entanglement of NETs and clots forms structures that are resistant to the body’s natural blood-clearing processes, a disruption that could directly explain symptoms such as &lt;em&gt;brain fog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;chronic pain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Journal of Medical Virology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When The Immune System Traps Itself: How The Body’s Defenses May Turn Against It&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NETs are normally part of the immune system’s frontline defense. These sticky webs of DNA and enzymes, released by white blood cells, trap invading pathogens before they can spread. In typical cases, NETs are quickly dissolved after doing their job. But in long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients,&lt;/strong&gt; researchers found that NETs lingered in large quantities, intertwining with microclots and potentially amplifying the damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology,” the authors write, “but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both microclots and NETs had been previously observed separately in other diseases, their &lt;strong&gt;combined presence and physical interaction&lt;/strong&gt; in long COVID patients marks a striking new insight. This synergy may explain why some people develop persistent symptoms long after the infection has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic,” says Thierry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; In other words, the body’s own immune response may be creating self-sustaining, harmful blood structures that prolong illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also help explain why standard diagnostic tests often fail to detect long COVID—these interactions happen at a microscopic level and wouldn’t necessarily show up on conventional scans or blood work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward A Blood-Based Test? AI Models See The Invisible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more remarkable aspects of the study was the use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/asian-militaries-and-artificial-intelligence/" data-type="post" data-id="42190"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to analyze anonymized blood samples. The AI was able to correctly identify long COVID patients with 91% accuracy based solely on the presence and patterns of microclots and NETs. This raises the possibility of developing a reliable &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic blood test&lt;/strong&gt; for a condition that has, until now, largely been diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could transform how doctors screen for and manage long COVID, and even open the door to personalized treatments aimed at breaking down these resistant structures in the blood. Clinical applications are still a long way off, but this research offers a promising roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the authors caution that more research is needed to prove causation—not just correlation—the patterns they uncovered mark a significant leap forward. If confirmed by future studies, the blood of long COVID patients may hold the key not only to diagnosis but to treatment strategies that could finally bring relief to millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, researchers say it takes time for the body to recover and reach the level of someone who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Tasdighi emphasized that this doesn't mean cessation doesn't have immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's important that people know that when they stop smoking, their risk goes down immediately and significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Miao agreed, adding that the study's most important takeaway is that "it's important to quit smoking early on, and no amount of smoking is without risk and health consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's not just patients who should heed the results of this study, the authors stressed. Physicians should also consider changing the way they inquire about smoking because the number of packs someone smokes per year is not necessarily predictive of long-term health risks, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Clinicians need a more nuanced approach that incorporates other ways to identify and quantify cigarette use, like smoking status and smoking intensity," Miao said, noting that whether it's smoking one cigarette a day or one a week, no amount of smoking is safe, and quitting remains the best thing someone can do for their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;To learn more about quitting smoking, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or make an appointment with your health care provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Radhika Malhotra, MD, is an internal medicine-preventive medicine resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 19:07:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOMGhZajNuWk5yWWhsOWJwbW85eG94Q3FZcE1IaDVzY3hEQnl2d0tNWXVveEYtUmF5cGpMYjQ3b2hfTExyeTNEM1VPT2VFclE5b3ZiZ183THBZYjZ4cWRIclg0a0p2VEhRd3prZFMzS2JnWXNsNm5PTWZPSGR6SVdaWExZNEVtUGFuZ1pUM3FfWFFKUGZlRXNXWDhzLVpyNkx5QkowTVc1dnhTUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOQjBmdDZlOUstQmZJejA3VDVMZXBGcDlxWFhacFdES19Bc0lvdGR3dThKQ2ZRbVpqY3dRdi1ielM2NVlvaUd5WmZyU1ZXZzExY2twbUNwNzJuNzd1OU9yZktxamNLSVNqR1gwTHluNWRKV2VBSTdyZF9fMm1NSnI2UERTYkgyRDRGUGFYZFJnUWVLREY3STZQNnltQS1ab2hZX1J3YXlzSHBmVk5IaDhN</guid></item><item><title>随着逃避免疫系统的新变种的出现，医生们准备迎接另一个破纪录的流感季节-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15302131/record-breaking-flu-season-variant-usa-subcladek.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is gearing up for another potentially record-breaking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-ff867f50-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; season, with a new variant spreading globally that is cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts expect the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season to equal or exceed last year's numbers, which had an estimated 47 to 82 million illnesses and 27,000 to 130,000 deaths, making it the worst in almost a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was also considered one of the most intense flu breakouts in at least 15 years, with exceptionally high rates of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and pediatric deaths, driven by a high severity of circulating strains and a lack of optimal vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A map tracking epidemic trends in the US related to flu shows cases of the virus are likely growing or currently growing in all states that report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of influenza currently make up two percent of positive lab tests of all respiratory specimens tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, visits to the doctor this week for influenza-like illness are up slightly this week to 2.1 percent of all visits, indicating early signs of rising flu activity. Children and younger adults are said to be driving much of the increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new flu variant that is currently raising concerns for its ability to partially evade the immune system and the seasonal vaccine is a variant of the existing H3N2 influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strain, which has been dubbed 'Subclade K', has spread rapidly in several countries, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-ff8bfd90-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-ff8b8860-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and it is expected to hit the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are designed to protect against the three main groups of flu Type A and B viruses that research indicates are most likely to spread and cause illness among people during the upcoming flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US is gearing up for yet another record-breaking flu season with a new variant spreading globally adding further cause for concern (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the recommended US flu vaccine does not protect against Subclade K, and is only designed to block the influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, and the influenza B virus, Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, f&lt;span&gt;lu vaccination coverage in the US has been slipping steadily since the COVID‑19 pandemic, according to recent CDC data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 2023–24 season, just 55.4 percent of children (ages six months to 17 years) received a flu shot, down two percentage points from the prior year and 8.3 points below pre‑pandemic levels in 2019–20.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, only 44.9 percent of adults were vaccinated, also two points lower than in 2022–23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subclade K is thought to have emerged at the tail end of Southern Hemisphere's flu season (which is May through October as opposed to October through May in the US) and early data from the UK and Japan suggests it is already represented in most flu samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been detected in North America, although it is unclear what proportion of samples it currently accounts for there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the recent record-breaking government shutdown and internal staffing changes, up-to-date national flu activity information from the CDC was temporarily unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government organization resumed updating its flu surveillance reports after the shutdown ended on November 12, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From November 3 to 9, the CDC reported that there&lt;span&gt; were 1,665 influenza-associated hospitalizations, which marks a five percent increase from the previous week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospitalization rate is currently one per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the peak of last year's flu season, that rate was 13.5 per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most frequently reported influenza strain is H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the nationwide level for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is low but both are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Alabama and New Hampshire, levels for respiratory illnesses are moderate, where as elsewhere across the country they are low to very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of yet, there has been no reporting from the CDC on the Subclade K strain.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Alabama and New Hampshire, levels for respiratory illnesses are moderate, where as elsewhere across the country they are low to very low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The CDC uses data from emergency department visits to model epidemic trends. This model helps reveal if the number of new respiratory infections is growing or declining in each state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subclade K flu symptoms are similar to other flu strains, with high fever, severe body aches, and fatigue being common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main concern is its rapid spread and ability to bypass some immunity, meaning vaccinations might not offer adequate protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anecdotal reports suggest in Australia it caused more severe body aches, longer-lasting tiredness and symptoms come on more suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation from the flu can make it difficult for the lungs to transfer enough oxygen to the rest of the body, raising the risk of deadly complications, including death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu can lead to pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure, deadly sepsis, or inflammation of the heart, brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also make existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma worse, and require hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned the reason it may spread more quickly is because it has a higher reproduction rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, the CDC and other health bodies warn that immunizations are still the best way to prevent serious illness from all strains of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone aged six months and older is advised to be up to date with the flu vaccine annually, each season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In week 45 of the influenza season (November 3 to 9) there were 1,665 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations, which marks a 5 percent increase form the previous week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A visual showing flu vaccination intent in the US among adults. Plummeting vaccination rates were cited as one of the main reasons for a rise in flu cases in the US for the 2024-2025 season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older residents in nursing homes are at heightened risk of severe illness and death from any one of the three viruses due to their weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the 2021-2022 flu season, the death rate for people 65 years and older was around 7.4 per 100,000 population, compared to 0.1 per 100,000 people among those aged 18 to 49 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plummeting vaccination rates were cited as one of the main reasons for a rise in flu cases in the US for the 2024-2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The flu vaccination rate for US children declined from about 64 percent five years ago to 49 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Childhood vaccinations in general have been declining, driven by online misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, health secretary Robert F.

The harmful effects were seen only in male mice, offering new clues about how microplastics may affect cardiovascular health in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="embedded-entity align-left"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our findings fit into a broader pattern seen in cardiovascular research, where males and females often respond differently,” said lead researcher &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/changchz"&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucr.edu/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. “Although the precise mechanism isn’t yet known, factors like sex chromosomes and hormones, particularly the protective effects of estrogen, may play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are now found nearly everywhere: in food, water, the air, and even inside the human body. Recent human studies have detected microplastics in atherosclerotic plaques and linked higher levels to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, scientists didn’t understand whether or how microplastics directly contribute to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely,” Zhou said. “Still, the best strategy is to reduce exposure by limiting plastic use in food and water containers, reducing single-use plastics, and avoiding highly-processed foods. There are currently no effective ways to remove microplastics from the body, so minimizing exposure and maintaining overall cardiovascular health — through diet, exercise, and managing risk factors — remains essential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in Environment International, Zhou and his team report their use of a well-established mouse model for studying heart disease: LDLR-deficient mice, which are prone to developing atherosclerosis. They fed both male and female mice a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, similar to a lean, healthy person’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then gave the mice a daily dose of microplastics (10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) for nine weeks at levels considered environmentally relevant and similar to what humans may encounter through contaminated food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found microplastics dramatically worsened atherosclerosis, but only in males. In male mice, microplastic exposure increased plaque buildup by 63% in the aortic root, the first section of the aorta that attaches to the heart; and 624% in the brachiocephalic artery, a blood vessel that branches off the aorta in the upper chest. In female mice, the same exposure did not significantly worsen plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found microplastics did not make the mice obese or raise their cholesterol. The mice remained lean, and their blood lipid levels did not change, meaning the increased artery damage was not due to traditional risk factors like weight gain or high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found microplastics altered key cells that line the arteries. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, a technology that helps identify which genes are expressed in each cell and at what level, the team found that microplastics disrupted the activity and proportions of several types of cells involved in atherosclerosis, especially endothelial cells — the cells that line blood vessels and regulate inflammation and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found endothelial cells were the most affected by microplastic exposure,” Zhou said. “Since endothelial cells are the first to encounter circulating microplastics, their dysfunction can initiate inflammation and plaque formation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the team’s experiments, fluorescent microplastics were found to enter plaques and localize within the endothelial layer — findings consistent with recent human studies showing microplastics in arterial lesions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding the researchers report from their experiments is that microplastics triggered harmful gene activity in both mouse and human endothelial cells. Exposure to microplastics was found to activate pro-atherogenic (plaque-promoting) genes in endothelial cells from mice and humans, suggesting a shared biological response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides some of the strongest evidence so far that microplastics may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, not just correlate with it,” Zhou said. “The surprising sex-specific effect — harming males but not females — could help researchers uncover protective factors or mechanisms that differ between men and women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou and his team acknowledge that more research is needed to understand why males are more vulnerable. The researchers plan to perform studies to determine if similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would like to investigate how different types or sizes of microplastics affect vascular cells,” Zhou said. “We will also look into the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial dysfunction and explore how microplastics affect male and female arteries differently. As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou was joined in the study by colleagues at UCR, Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was partially supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

Many people clear the virus within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It can take decades, however, for the infection to actually cause &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the back of the throat, known as throat cancer, or oropharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Michael Douglas was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-hpv-453877-20250807"&gt;diagnosed with throat cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, and although the actor said publicly that the stage four disease was possibly &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-causes-678858-20250807"&gt;linked to oral sex&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; star acknowledged other risk factors like being a smoker and a drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men who have sex with other men 'have higher risk than straight men' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are men more likely to be diagnosed with HPV cancer than women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Around two in three new HPV-related head and neck cancer cases in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; are in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Karis Betts, a cancer epidemiologist from Cancer Research UK, told LADbible that 'it can take decades' for HPV to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;On why men often face higher rates of HPV cancers, the expert further explained: “There are studies that look at risk for different people. Straight women who have sex with men have a higher risk than women who have sex exclusively with women. And men who have sex with men have higher risk than straight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The HPV vaccine is also available up to age 40 for men who have sex with men because the risk is slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Nearly one in 96 UK females and one in 43 UK males will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer in their lifetime (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers than women. This kind of historically links to other risk factors as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“If you look a few decades ago, there were really high rates of smoking in men, high rates of alcohol, and they’ve consistently been higher than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers, particularly in the mouth and throat, and these cancers are also caused by other things that are more prevalent in men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She stressed that 'smoking and alcohol are going to be much bigger drivers of head and neck cancers than HPV'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men are diagnosed with HPV cancer more than women (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid HPV-related throat cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex, touching, and sharing sex toys. While condoms can help, 'they’re not 100 percent effective'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The big kind of preventable measures against HPV in the population are vaccination and cervical screening,” Betts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Vaccines kind of work best, and that's why they work best at that school age, because it's before people have had any exposure to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“If people are worried about their cancer risk, the best things that they can do, especially for head and neck cancer, is to not smoke, or stop smoking, and reduce their alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Things like that will have a much bigger benefit on your cancer risk than kind of worrying about an HPV infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She stressed that 'the advice isn’t going to be stop having sex', adding: "People should live and enjoy their lives, and sex is part of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Head and neck cancer accounts for three percent of all new cancer cases in the UK (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of throat cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12180-oropharyngeal-cancer"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the Cleveland Clinic, symptoms and causes of throat cancer include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list_list__njBdr"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or difficulty swallowing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble opening your mouth or moving your tongue fully&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constant or unexplained ear pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump in the back of the throat or inside the mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump or swelling in the neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white patch on the tongue or inside the mouth that doesn’t disappear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve been affected by any of these issues and want to speak to someone in confidence, contact Macmillan’s Cancer Support Line on 0808 808 00 00, 8am–8pm seven days a week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:17:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNX1dBY1poVW5mMnZmZGJjX2tVZGtsT0RTbEVNNEcxMzZ1d2Uyd0UtNzFoOUZlTGdMWlhhN2dNYU51VUNMenJwRXhWNFJZOVY0UEhiSUo1S3dacGl3NlQyTkRTb2dVeDFSdm1yOTNUWDN0X2FQRnNRM0NpSzdMRnM1SWlzeFRDQnZCTmNIQ1FPTF9SMzMzQ3hSMjF2dzFPS3Zy</guid></item><item><title>锻炼肌肉需要多长时间？这是事实- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-muscle-2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long does it take to build muscle&lt;/em&gt; is not, of course, a question with a simple answer, despite what the TikToks or Reels promising to unlock the one thing you need to get big might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they tend to raise many more questions: Like, should you be fasting? Or should you be cutting out cardio, relying solely on supersets, smashing calisthenics, attending military bootcamps, doing everything on the bosu ball, using only kettlebells, taking protein immediately after your workout, nailing creatine, eating lots and lots of beef, training at a specific heart rate, squatting with your partner on your shoulders, performing every workout without your top on, or adding a resistance band to absolutely everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of suggestions goes on. There’s a gym obsession for everyone, but none of it will get you in shape the way that focusing on the (somewhat less sexy) essentials will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's go back to basics. This is the only information you really need to tackle the perennial question: how long does it take to build muscle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we actually build muscle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of building muscle is known as &lt;em&gt;hypertrophy&lt;/em&gt;. We enter hypertrophy when we apply tension to our muscles during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This tension stimulates a cascade of biological signals in the body which leads to an increase in muscle protein synthesis, a process during which new proteins are produced and integrated into the muscle fibers, leading to larger and stronger muscles,” explains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Harry Cox&lt;/a&gt;, founder of London’s high-end &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.clubqhealth.com/"}' href="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Club Q Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we actually do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resistance training&lt;/em&gt; is a great way to build muscle in the gym. Essentially, this means moving your body with weights to make those movements harder. A bicep curl with a dumbbell is harder than it would be with no weight, for instance. This is resistance training. The heavier the weight—or greater the resistance—the more our muscles are forced to adapt, making them grow stronger over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do it right and you can build muscle by weight training as little as two to three times a week, according to fitness expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should always make sure to increase your weights to push yourself and ensure you are creating as much resistance, and therefore muscle trauma, as possible,” she says, referring to a method called &lt;em&gt;progressive overload&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To progressively overload your muscles, you’ll want to go heavier on at least two out of your four sets per exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:05:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE4wUFZpbGY2d3o2QVFkYWRjVVJlRDg3WTJFZjUxOHYzVFEyVk5mZUJBZldaY3dGZzEzMUJ5LVY1d0FCM3NfcGFNQlBqdU1OU3hfckxWb1RIcENJSjQxYTd3Y3FsaHc4czdMWFdMdGhObDF3Zw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现二甲双胍可能阻碍关键的运动益处- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251117095648.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A widely used medication for diabetes prevention may unexpectedly interfere with one of the most reliable ways to lower disease risk: regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rutgers-led team reported in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that metformin appeared to weaken several important benefits normally gained from exercise. These include improvements in blood vessel function, overall fitness and the body's ability to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, medical guidance has encouraged people with elevated blood sugar to combine metformin with consistent exercise. The expectation was that two well-established treatments would reinforce one another. According to the Rutgers researchers, the evidence suggests a different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most health care providers assume one plus one equals two," said Steven Malin, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health in the School of Arts and Sciences and the lead author of the study. "The problem is that most evidence shows metformin blunts exercise benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Tested Metformin's Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this issue, Malin and his colleagues enrolled 72 adults considered at risk for metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of conditions known to raise the likelihood of both diabetes and heart disease. Participants were separated into four groups: high-intensity exercise with placebo, high-intensity exercise with metformin, low-intensity exercise with placebo and low-intensity exercise with metformin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a 16-week training period, the research team measured how well participants' blood vessels responded to insulin. This response helps vessels widen and deliver oxygen, hormones and nutrients after eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that exercise alone strengthened vascular insulin sensitivity. Blood vessels became more responsive to insulin, allowing greater blood flow to the muscles. This is important because insulin-assisted dilation helps move glucose from the bloodstream into body tissues, lowering blood sugar after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metformin Significantly Reduced Expected Gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When metformin was added, these improvements became noticeably smaller. The medication also appeared to limit gains in aerobic capacity and lessen positive changes in inflammation and fasting blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessel function improved with exercise training, regardless of intensity," Malin said. "Metformin blunted that observation, suggesting one type of exercise intensity is not better either with the drug for blood vessel health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are concerning because exercise is intended to support healthy blood sugar levels and improve physical capability. If metformin reduces these effects, patients relying on both may not receive the degree of protection they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you exercise and take metformin and your blood glucose does not go down, that's a problem," Malin said. "People taking metformin also didn't gain fitness. That means their physical function isn't getting better and that could have long-term health risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Life Consequences for Daily Function and Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin noted that exercise-driven fitness improvements influence everyday activities such as climbing stairs, playing with children or maintaining an active social life. If these gains are diminished, overall quality of life can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the findings should not prompt anyone to stop taking metformin or abandon exercise. Instead, the study highlights the need for physicians to closely consider how these interventions interact and to monitor patient progress. Malin hopes that future studies will help identify approaches that preserve the positive effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Metformin May Interfere With Exercise Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason metformin dampens exercise benefits is still being investigated. Malin explained that metformin partly works by inhibiting specific mitochondrial processes. This action reduces oxidative stress and helps regulate blood sugar. However, the same interference may block the cellular changes typically triggered by exercise, including better mitochondrial efficiency and improved aerobic performance. In essence, the mechanism that makes metformin effective may also hinder the body's ability to fully respond to physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have suggested a similar pattern, but this trial is one of the first to look closely at vascular insulin sensitivity, a key factor in both glucose control and cardiovascular health. By demonstrating that metformin can limit changes in both major arteries and small capillaries across different exercise intensities, the researchers highlight how complex these combined treatments can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Diabetes Prevention and Clinical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin pointed out that nearly 35 million people in the United States live with type 2 diabetes, and prevention strategies often depend on a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. If these approaches do not work together as expected, long-term risks may increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to figure out how to best recommend exercise with metformin," Malin said. "We also need to consider how other medications interact with exercise to develop better guidelines for doctors to help people lower chronic disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that we may be able to develop treatment or prevention strategies that are helpful for young people with a range of common disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dIewYy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569078"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that girls and boys are more alike than previously thought, as both experienced similar changes in brain structure with the same mental health disorders. This was surprising given that previous, albeit much smaller, studies had suggested that girls and boys with the same disorder might show different changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is despite considerable evidence showing ADHD and conduct disorder is more common in boys, and depression and anxiety is more common in adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephane De Brito from the University of Birmingham, who also contributed to the study, said: “At this point in time, while we can say that the brain is involved in all four of the disorders that we studied, it seems unlikely that these changes in brain structure can explain why there are important sex differences in the prevalence of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means we might have to look at other factors such as the child's early environment or experiences, which might interact with changes in the structure or function of the brain to increase risk for developing disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together 68 international research groups across five continents from the global alliance group of scientists at the ENIGMA Consortium, which specialises in understanding brain structure and genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ftgoqS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569079"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (University of Bath)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalised anxiety disorder is defined as feelings of stress or worry that affect your daily life and are difficult to control. The NHS says symptoms include difficulty sleeping, feeling restless, irritable or finding it difficult to concentrate and getting tired easily, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is defined as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sadness, hopelessness and losing interest in things you used to enjoy. The NHS says symptoms include continuous sadness, feeling hopeless and low self-esteem. These symptoms may persist for weeks or months and become bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is defined as a person’s ability to pay attention to things, having high energy levels (being hyperactive) and their ability to control their impulses. Symptoms of ADHD, according to the NHS, usually start before the age of 12 and include being easily distracted, finding it hard to listen or follow instructions and forgetting everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct disorder is defined as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which societal norms, rules or laws are violated. Symptoms can include aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness and theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOX3I3OHY3WkdmYVNwOGtYTkJUWHRVWkpQdUlUOHdFZEZVdTRObWN6eThrQzAwT0FUbHNqY0Fhb0VpRDJVQzRCWENpak52ekVqSFBoZEZUWU5YUUdrRHdYWDdQZnEzY3J3MS1RWFA1V1FHLVJFbUF3MmxyUVo1Vjg5NmpuWTJ1ZV9rWnVtY3VMUjlPRTNXV2ZIYw</guid></item><item><title>排毒肝脏的5种天然家庭疗法-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/5-natural-home-remedies-to-detoxify-the-liver/photostory/125413965.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ayurveda, digestion and metabolism are carried out by two different fires.

The number of affected individuals increased from 378 million in 1990 to 788 million in 2023. As populations have expanded and grown older, the condition has reached a point where it is now listed among the top 10 causes of death across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from NYU Langone Health, the University of Glasgow, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington led the investigation. Their work focused on chronic kidney disease, a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose the ability to clear waste and extra fluid from the bloodstream. Early stages often produce no noticeable symptoms, while advanced disease may require dialysis, kidney replacement therapy, or a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Burden and Mortality Trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study estimates that roughly 14% of adults worldwide live with chronic kidney disease. In addition, approximately 1.5 million people died from the condition in 2023. When changes in population age structures are taken into account, this represents more than a 6% increase in deaths since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that chronic kidney disease is common, deadly, and getting worse as a major public health issue," said study co-senior author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. "These findings support efforts to recognize the condition alongside cancer, heart disease, and mental health concerns as a major priority for policymakers around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Health Priority for Global Agencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the World Health Organization added chronic kidney disease to its list of health priorities aimed at reducing early deaths from noncontagious diseases by one-third before 2030. Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that identifying current patterns in the disease is essential for developing effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report was published online Nov. 7 in The Lancet and, according to the authors, represents the most detailed assessment of chronic kidney disease in nearly ten years. It is also being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, considered the most wide-ranging effort to track health-related loss in countries over long periods of time. Findings from this initiative frequently inform public health policy and guide future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate the new estimates, the team examined 2,230 scientific papers and national health datasets from 133 countries. Their work centered not only on diagnoses and deaths, but also on the level of disability associated with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to Heart Disease and Leading Risk Factors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key conclusion was that impaired kidney function is a major contributor to heart disease. The study reports that it accounted for about 12% of global cardiovascular deaths. In 2023, chronic kidney disease ranked as the 12th leading cause of disability-related reductions in quality of life. High blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high body mass index (a measure of obesity) were identified as the most significant risk factors for developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most individuals in the study were in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. Coresh emphasizes that this is a crucial window for intervention, as timely treatment and lifestyle changes can prevent the need for dialysis or transplantation later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Treatment Remains Uneven Worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh also points out that in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other lower-income regions, many people do not receive dialysis or transplants. These therapies are less accessible and often too expensive for widespread use in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated," said study co-lead author Morgan Grams, MD, PhD. "Our report underscores the need for more urine testing to catch it early and the need to ensure that patients can afford and access therapy once they are diagnosed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapies but Slow Global Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that several new medications introduced over the past five years can slow disease progression and reduce the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Even so, she explains that it will take time before the benefits of these treatments are reflected worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also warns that because chronic kidney disease is often not tested for, its true global prevalence may be even higher than the study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Support and Research Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was funded by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446, the Gates Foundation, and the National Kidney Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh serves as a scientific adviser and equity holder in Healthy.io, a health technology company that provides remote clinical testing and related services. He also works as a consultant for SomaLogic. These roles are disclosed and managed according to NYU Langone Health policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Coresh and Grams, Patrick Mark, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Lauryn Stafford, MS, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle, were co-lead authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional co-senior authors included Jennifer Lees, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Theo Vos, PhD, and Liane Ong, PhD, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Aging sneaks up on everyone, but nothing prepares you for the moment you realize your parents are getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not something that happens slowly in your mind. It hits you all at once, like an emotional punch you didn’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, they’re lecturing you about “real music” or fixing the kitchen sink like it’s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next, you’re helping them figure out how to refill a prescription or turn on closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are eight moments that make you stop in your tracks and realize your parents aren’t invincible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) They start repeating the same stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard the one about their first apartment more times than you can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rent was cheap, the neighbors were weird, and they had to walk uphill both ways to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that they don’t remember telling you before. It’s that those memories have become more alive than the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past feels comfortable to them, like a well-worn sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to interrupt my dad when he started his story about his first guitar gig. Now, I just listen. Because one day, I’ll wish I could hear it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start realizing that their memories matter more than their plans, and that’s a hard truth to sit with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Their physical pace slows down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it’s barely noticeable. Maybe your mom walks a little slower at the park, or your dad takes his time getting out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, you realize they’re always a few steps behind. They rest more often, sit longer, and move with a kind of caution you never saw before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this with my mom last year when she visited California. She used to insist on walking everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, she suggested we drive to the café two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a quiet, heartbreaking shift. The same people who once carried you up the stairs now take them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Technology starts to leave them behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when they laughed at you for being glued to your phone? Now they struggle to find the camera app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve explained what “the cloud” is more times than you can count. And every time, it feels like starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about time. They grew up in a world that didn’t constantly update itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between Facebook and streaming services, they reached their limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s tough to watch isn’t the confusion itself, but the &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-9-habits-people-fall-into-as-they-age-that-quietly-destroy-their-confidence/"&gt;loss of confidence&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it. The people who once taught you everything now turn to you for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Their health becomes a constant conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, dinner talk sounds like a medical briefing. They mention cholesterol, blood pressure, or that “funny pain” that won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start recognizing the names of their medications and the days of their doctor appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time my dad called just to tell me about a new supplement he was taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not about music, not about his day, just &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize you’ve entered a new stage of life, where “How are you doing?” really means “How’s your health holding up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) They start saying “I’m tired” more often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just at the end of a long day. Sometimes, it’s in the middle of a sentence, or after a story, or while looking out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m just tired.” Those three words mean more than they let on. It’s not only &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-eeling-exhausted-psychology-says-these-7-common-habits-are-secretly-draining-your-energy/"&gt;physical exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s life fatigue, the kind that comes from decades of being responsible for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boomers are the generation that pushed through everything. Work, bills, parenting, social change. They didn’t rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when they finally say they’re tired, it’s like a quiet confession that they can’t keep pushing forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a moment that softens you. You start seeing their strength as something that came at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) They lose touch with what’s current&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mention a new artist, and they ask, “Who?” You show them a viral video, and they blink like you’re &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-9-refined-hobbies-that-secretly-reveal-a-high-value-personality/"&gt;speaking another language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not trying to be out of touch. They just stopped keeping up. The noise of trends, names, and updates no longer matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom once told me she didn’t recognize anyone performing at the Grammys. Not one name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the same woman who raised me on Fleetwood Mac and Joni Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization stings. The people who gave you your love of culture now live outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about music or memes. It’s about time pulling you in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) They start talking about the past like it’s all that matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their stories start with “Back in my day” or “When you were little” more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not nostalgia in the lighthearted sense. It’s comfort. The past feels safer than a world they no longer recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but nostalgia isn’t just reminiscing. It’s a kind of psychological anchor. It helps people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-live-peacefully-despite-chaos-around-them-usually-display-these-9-traits/"&gt;feel grounded&lt;/a&gt; when everything around them moves too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts a little when you realize they’re living more in memory than in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re trying to make new memories with them, and they’re holding onto the old ones like lifelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) They start needing you in ways they never did before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is the hardest to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mom asks you to help her with her online banking. Your dad wants you to drive him to the doctor, “just in case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start filling out forms for them, &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-10-practical-skills-boomers-have-that-younger-people-pay-hundreds-of-dollars-to-outsource/"&gt;fixing appliances&lt;/a&gt;, and organizing paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the one who remembers things, who plans, who takes charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift happens quietly, and suddenly you’re the adult in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt it the day my dad asked me to organize his medications. This was the same man who once built my first bike from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him confused over pill bottles broke something inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize the roles have reversed. The people who once held your world together now lean on you to keep theirs steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The quiet ache of realizing they’re human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these moments are loud or dramatic. They’re small changes you notice in passing. But together, they paint a picture that’s impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your boomer parents aren’t superheroes anymore. They’re human. Vulnerable. Slowing down in a world that refuses to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that realization hurts, because it reflects your own timeline too. You see where you came from, and you catch a glimpse of where you’re heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to slow down with them. To listen to those old stories again. To take the drive to the café, even if it’s only two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because one day, you’ll wish for just one more story, one more walk, one more reminder that they were here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr.
Lois Anne Cook (née Simmons), age 76, passed away on November 3,
2025, in Eureka, California. Born on October 22, 1949, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lois lived a life defined by service,
compassion, and an unwavering dedication to healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
pursued her medical education at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA and completed her residency in pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. Her commitment to public health led her to serve as a
Fellow in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control from 1985 to 1987, where she focused on the
epidemiology of birth defects and developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her
career was marked by a deep devotion to children and families. From
June 1988 to June 1999, she served as a developmental pediatrician
and multidisciplinary team leader for the United States Department of
Defense’s Exceptional Family Member Program. In this role, she worked
tirelessly to ensure that military families with special needs
children received the support and care they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
June 2001, Lois founded Comprehensive Pediatric Care, P.C., where she
served as owner and pediatrician until May 2013. Her practice was not
just a place of medicine but a sanctuary of hope for countless
families. She later continued her work as a developmental
pediatrician at Open Door Clinic from June 2013 to July 2014 and then
as a pediatric hospitalist at Mad River Community Hospital beginning
in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
also gave generously of her time as a mentor with the Meritius
Foundation, helping guide and inspire future generations of
caregivers and leaders. Her professional life was a testament to her
belief that every child deserved not only medical care but also
affirmation, encouragement, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Outside
of her professional accomplishments, Lois lived with profound
spiritual depth. Her spirituality transcended any single tradition —
it was an ever-present force in how she moved through life, treated
others, and found meaning in both the ordinary and extraordinary.
Whether hiking with her beloved dogs Lulu and Muzzy or listening to
meditation books through her earbuds, she found peace and purpose in
nature and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every
day, rain or shine, she walked Lulu and Muzzy at the dog park near
her home in McKinleyville. During blackberry season, she would return
from those walks with bags full of berries she had picked along the
way — simple joys that reflected her deep connection to the world
around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
was an avid reader with an extensive library that reflected both her
intellectual curiosity and spiritual journey. She inspired countless
people to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams. Through her
example, she showed that anything is possible when guided by love,
faith, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
leaves behind her daughter Jennifer Paris; her sister Jeanne; and
brothers Leon, John, Mark, and Joe. She was preceded in death by her
daughter Marian Jessica Cook and brother Danny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois’s
legacy lives on in the lives of those she touched — patients who
felt truly seen and heard under her care; colleagues who were
uplifted by her wisdom; family members who were nourished by her
love; and friends who were transformed by her presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
was truly an instrument of God — relentless in her pursuit of
healing, committed wholly to service, and gifted with one of the most
compassionate hearts imaginable. She gave selflessly — never
hesitating to offer help or comfort — and never stopped searching
for answers when it came to those under her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May
her memory bring comfort to all who knew her and continue to inspire
those who follow in her footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Dr. Lois Cook’s loved ones.

&lt;p&gt;Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans’ views on childhood vaccines, vaccine research and vaccine policy. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,111 adults from Oct. 20 to 26, 2025. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, presidential vote (among voters) and other factors. &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/the-american-trends-panel/"&gt;Read more about the ATP’s methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_questionnaire.pdf"&gt;questions used for this report&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_topline.pdf"&gt;topline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/childhood-vaccines-methodology/"&gt;survey methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A majority of Americans (63%) are highly confident that childhood vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness. And majorities say these vaccines protect both vaccinated children (69%) and the wider community (65%), though larger shares of Democrats than Republicans hold these views.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;By comparison, smaller shares of U.S. adults – and Republicans in particular – are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines have gotten enough safety testing (53%) or that the vaccine schedule is safe (51%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (92%) and Republicans (78%) say the benefits of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine outweigh the risks. Still, among Republicans, this share is down from 91% in 2016.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Republican support for MMR vaccine school requirements also continues to slip, from 79% in 2019 to 52% today.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say medical scientists should have a major role in childhood vaccine policy decisions. In turn, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say parents of young children should have a major role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a year that has seen &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv"&gt;evolving federal vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000"&gt;historic measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, 63% of Americans have high confidence in the effectiveness of childhood vaccines. But trust dips somewhat when it comes to their safety testing (53%) and schedule (51%). This drop-off is especially pronounced among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Pew Research Center survey asked Americans about their views on childhood vaccines, vaccine research and related policy. This study builds on the Center’s broader work tracking Americans’ attitudes about &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/science/science-issues/medicine-health/vaccines/"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/science/trust-in-science/"&gt;trust in science&lt;/a&gt;. This analysis covers findings on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/11/18/have-changes-to-cdc-guidelines-influenced-americans-covid-19-vaccine-decisions/"&gt;How have changes to CDC recommendations influenced Americans’ COVID-19 vaccine decisions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A majority of Americans (63%) are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;with Democrats and Democrat-leaners much more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaners to express a high level of confidence (80% vs. 48%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, there’s somewhat less certainty, and more &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;, about these vaccines’ safety testing and schedule &lt;/strong&gt;– that is, the timing and number of vaccines children get. About half of Americans are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines have been tested enough for safety (53%) or that the schedule is safe (51%). On the flip side, about one-in-five are not too or not at all confident in either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This doubt is heavily driven by Republicans, who are divided between high and low confidence in childhood vaccine safety.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, 32% of Republicans have high confidence in the vaccine schedule’s safety, and 31% have low confidence. Democrats are much more aligned: 71% have high confidence and 7% have low confidence in the schedule’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="views-by-demographic-group"&gt;Views by demographic group&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Across all three vaccine dimensions we asked about, &lt;strong&gt;older adults are somewhat more likely than younger ones to trust childhood vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, 63% of people ages 65 and older express high confidence in vaccine safety testing, compared with about half of adults under 50 (49%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race and ethnicity:&lt;/strong&gt; Asian (70%) and White (66%) adults are more likely to be highly confident childhood vaccines are effective against serious illness, compared with Black (54%) and Hispanic (58%) adults. When it comes to trust in their safety testing and schedule, Asian adults are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to be extremely or very confident.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with more education are more likely than those with less education to express trust in the effectiveness, safety and schedule of childhood vaccines. For example, two-thirds of adults with a postgraduate degree say they are highly confident in the vaccine schedule, compared with less than half of those who have a high school education or less (44%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But low confidence in vaccine safety testing and the schedule is not limited to adults with a high school degree or less.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, similar shares of Americans with a four-year college degree (19%), some college (21%) or high school degree or less (19%) are not too or not at all confident in the vaccine schedule’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents of children under age 18, &lt;/strong&gt;who are in the thick of childhood vaccine decisions, are slightly more likely than adults without minor children to have low confidence in the effectiveness, safety testing and schedule of these vaccines. For example, 24% of parents have low confidence in the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule, compared with 17% of adults who don’t have minor children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more on parents’ views on childhood vaccines, refer to this additional analysis: &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/parents-confidence-in-childhood-vaccine-effectiveness-safety-testing-and-schedule/"&gt;Parents’ confidence in childhood vaccine effectiveness, safety testing and schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. measles cases in 2025 reached their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;highest level in more than two decades&lt;/a&gt;, with the vast majority of reported cases occurring among unvaccinated people. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has been part of routine child immunization in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/measles"&gt;since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline"&gt;share of children receiving it&lt;/a&gt; has dipped in recent years, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;strong&gt;Americans’ positive views on the MMR vaccine have largely held since we first started asking about this in 2016.&lt;/strong&gt; A solid majority (84%) says its benefits outweigh its risks. And seven-in-ten say the vaccine’s preventative health benefits are high or very high, while just 15% say the same about the risk of side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (92%) and Republicans (78%) say that the MMR vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks. Yet Republicans are more likely than Democrats to rate the risk of side effects as high (20% vs. 9%) and less likely to say the preventative health benefits are high (62% vs. 80%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Republicans have grown less positive about the MMR vaccine over time. In 2016, 75% of Republicans rated its preventive health benefits of highly, compared with 62% today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/childhood-vaccines-appendix/"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt; for views of the MMR vaccine by demographic group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="8c4f90b810311e0057221944ad1ff0aa" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;School MMR requirements&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine is currently required for children to enter public school &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-indicator/state-vaccine-requirements-for-children/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"&gt;in every state&lt;/a&gt;, but school vaccine policies have been a flashpoint of debate as Florida plans to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/florida-plans-end-all-state-vaccine-mandates-including-schools-2025-09-03/"&gt;eliminate school vaccine requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, a vast majority of U.S. adults have said healthy children should be required to get the vaccine to attend public school because of the potential risks for others when children are not vaccinated. &lt;strong&gt;But support for school MMR requirements dropped from 82% in 2019 to 69% in 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This decline is largely because of a steep slide in support among Republicans. &lt;/strong&gt;In 2019, before the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, 79% of Republicans said healthy children should be required to get the MMR vaccine to attend school. This share sunk to 57% in 2023, then to 52% in 2025. In contrast, Democrats’ views on school MMR requirements have remained stable, with solid majority support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond trust in childhood vaccines, this survey also looks at Americans’ impressions of the scientists who study them. Previous Center research has found that U.S. adults &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/trust-in-science-2024-appendix/ps_2024-11-14_trust-in-science_a-02/"&gt;largely trust medical scientists&lt;/a&gt; to act in the public’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to research on childhood vaccine risks and benefits, a vast majority (87%) say medical scientists’ findings are &lt;strong&gt;influenced by the best available scientific evidence&lt;/strong&gt; either most of the time (49%) or some of the time (38%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 85% say their research is &lt;strong&gt;influenced by concern for the best interests of children’s health &lt;/strong&gt;at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Majorities also see the interests of &lt;strong&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/strong&gt; (77%) and scientists’ own &lt;strong&gt;political leanings&lt;/strong&gt; (64%) as influential at least some of the time. Smaller shares say these factors influence childhood vaccine research &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time, compared with the role of scientific evidence and concern for children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partisans disagree about how often these factors influence medical scientists’ research:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say scientists are influenced most of the time by the best available scientific evidence (66% vs. 35%) and by the best interests of children’s health (62% vs. 34%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;But Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say scientists are influenced most of the time by the interests of pharmaceutical companies (45% vs. 22%) or by their own political leanings (29% vs. 14%).The shares of Republicans saying medical scientists are influenced this much by concern for children and the best scientific evidence have dropped since 2016 (-18 and -13 percentage points, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many groups – from scientists to parents to government and heads of industry – have a stake in childhood vaccine policy. How much influence do Americans think they should have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americans largely say medical scientists should play a major role in childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Roughly three-quarters say scientists should have a major role in these decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A smaller majority (59%) see a major role for &lt;strong&gt;parents of young children &lt;/strong&gt;in vaccine policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around four-in-ten or fewer say the general public (37%), federal officials (27%), state officials (26%), pharmaceutical leaders (25%) or health insurance providers (17%) should play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About half of Americans say &lt;strong&gt;health insurance company leaders should&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; role&lt;/strong&gt; in making decisions on childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="e751683aa4fbfc8d870d626de8251b29" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Views by party&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous Center work has found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support scientists playing an active role in &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/ps_2024-11-14_trust-in-science_00-08/"&gt;policy debates about scientific issues&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, a much larger share of Democrats (85%) than Republicans (62%) say medical scientists should have a major role in decisions about childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Views are reversed when it comes to the role of parents with young children. &lt;strong&gt;Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say parents of young children should have a major role &lt;/strong&gt;in policy decisions about childhood vaccines (71% vs. 46%). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are smaller partisan differences for the other groups we asked about. For example, 44% of Republicans say the general public should play a major role, compared with 30% of Democrats. And small shares in both parties say health insurance company leaders should have a major role (14% Republicans and 18% Democrats).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="9105dc163aa30405598727b45ce38203" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Views by education&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults with more education are more likely to say medical scientists should have a major role in childhood vaccine policy decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; Americans with a postgraduate degree (86%) overwhelmingly hold this view, compared with a smaller majority among those who have a high school education or less (65%). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults with a high school education or less are more likely than those with at least a four-year college degree to support a major role for parents with young children (68% vs. 49%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 data-is-section="true" data-wp-context='{"id":"to-what-extent-do-childhood-vaccines-protect-children-and-communities"}' data-wp-interactive='{"namespace":"prc-block\/table-of-contents"}' class="wp-block-heading" id="to-what-extent-do-childhood-vaccines-protect-children-and-communities"&gt;To what extent do childhood vaccines protect children and communities?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines can protect a vaccinated child from serious illness, but broad vaccine coverage also protects the wider community – a concept often called “&lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/what-do-vaccines-do/how-herd-immunity-works"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mirroring their overall confidence in childhood vaccine effectiveness, majorities of U.S. adults see both of these preventive qualities. About seven-in-ten say childhood vaccines help prevent serious illness among vaccinated children a great deal or quite a bit. A similar share (65%) say the same about vaccines protecting everybody in the local community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both parties share these attitudes at least somewhat, though they are more common among Democrats than Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democrats overwhelmingly think childhood vaccines do a lot to prevent illness among children (82%) and across the local community (80%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Republicans’ views are more tepid: 57% say these vaccines do a lot to protect vaccinated children, while 52% say they do a lot to protect the community. Roughly one-in-ten say childhood vaccines &lt;em&gt;do not help much or at all&lt;/em&gt; on these fronts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older adults and those with more education are more likely than younger and those with less education to say childhood vaccines protect both vaccinated children and the broader community, though majorities across age and education groups still say this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina residents are dying younger—and not by chance. In a country already struggling with declining longevity, the Palmetto State has fallen further behind. In 2022, its average life expectancy stood at &lt;strong&gt;73.5 years&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;four full years&lt;/strong&gt; below the U.S. average of &lt;strong&gt;77.5&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Center for Health Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That gap reflects a complex interplay of preventable risk factors: air pollution, chronic disease, limited healthcare access, and mental illness. Unlike in many high-performing states, public infrastructure in South Carolina fails to consistently support healthy behaviors or provide timely, continuous care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report from Earth.com&lt;/a&gt; highlights South Carolina’s lagging performance across multiple health indices, including access to parks, smoking prevalence, and food environment quality. Together, these indicators point to a population exposed to cumulative risk—and a state system that struggles to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, life expectancy in the United States rebounded slightly in 2022 following a COVID-induced drop, but improvements are uneven. South Carolina’s figures remain well below the national mean, a red flag for both state and federal health planners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Air Pollution and Its Long Tail on Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more insidious but well-documented drivers of early mortality is &lt;strong&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/strong&gt;, especially &lt;strong&gt;PM2.5&lt;/strong&gt;—particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. As detailed by the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, these pollutants can enter the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/air-quality-alert-issued-across-the-u-s-heres-the-full-list-of-affected-states-and-counties/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97425" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lungs and bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, exacerbating &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/caffeine-intake-dangerous-heart-risks/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7529" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While South Carolina doesn’t consistently exceed EPA thresholds for PM2.5, &lt;strong&gt;regional exposure hotspots&lt;/strong&gt; remain, particularly in urban centers and along industrial corridors. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthy States Index&lt;/a&gt; notes that South Carolina has a low density of public green spaces and a disproportionately high number of unhealthy food outlets—both of which discourage physical activity and limit access to healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These factors aren’t incidental. The EPA warns that even low to moderate exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk of &lt;strong&gt;premature death&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly among older adults and individuals with preexisting heart or lung disease. South Carolina’s uneven air quality and built environment reflect national trends in health disparity—rural, low-income, and nonwhite communities tend to bear the heaviest burden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mental Illness Cuts Deeper Than Suicide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pivotal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analyzed over 200 studies and found that individuals with mental disorders face more than double the risk of early death compared to the general population. On average, mental illness shortens life by &lt;strong&gt;10 years&lt;/strong&gt;—often not through suicide, but through &lt;strong&gt;natural causes&lt;/strong&gt; like cardiovascular disease, infection, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review found that &lt;strong&gt;67.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of deaths in people with mental disorders were due to physical illness, not external causes. Despite this, many states—including South Carolina—lack adequate psychiatric infrastructure. Rural areas in particular remain designated as &lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas&lt;/strong&gt;, according to data from the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the issue, mental illness is tightly linked to &lt;strong&gt;higher rates of tobacco use&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;poor diet&lt;/strong&gt;—each of which magnifies risk for premature death. The state’s &lt;strong&gt;elevated smoking prevalence&lt;/strong&gt;, cited in the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; report, remains above national averages despite public health campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Broken Links in Care and Follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another structural issue driving South Carolina’s longevity gap is &lt;strong&gt;continuity of care&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; analysis, the state shows elevated &lt;strong&gt;hospital readmission rates&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting significant deficiencies in post-discharge support and care coordination. For patients with chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, access to medications, and transportation to clinics are often lacking—especially in rural or low-income zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readmission rates serve as a proxy for overall system performance. High figures often point to underinvestment in &lt;strong&gt;preventive care&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;primary medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;social support services&lt;/strong&gt;. In a region with high rates of &lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;, these gaps can compound quickly into excess mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; further reinforce the link between chronic disease and early death. In 2022, heart disease and cancer remained the two leading causes of mortality nationwide. Both are heavily influenced by behavior, environment, and system-level access to early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Geography of Health Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s four-year life expectancy gap is not an anomaly—it is an early warning. The disparity reflects a widening health divide between high-income, infrastructure-rich regions and those where systems are under-resourced or absent altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications are economic as well as epidemiological. Poorer health outcomes increase state healthcare costs, reduce workforce productivity, and impose a heavier burden on safety-net services. Public health is infrastructure, and its erosion has measurable downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State averages can also obscure deep &lt;strong&gt;intra-state variation&lt;/strong&gt;. Some counties in South Carolina outperform the national average, while others lag by nearly a decade. These pockets of high risk, shaped by poverty, pollution, and limited access to services, reinforce the urgent need for targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But if you are trying to maximize the boost you get from your cup of Joe, is there a best time to drink coffee to reap the most health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you’re after coffee’s big energy boost (which comes primarily from caffeine, a natural stimulant), timing matters. “Caffeine works by blocking adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired,” explains &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N." data-node-id="3.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian based in New Orleans. “As a result, caffeine can provide a boost in energy and focus. It also slightly increases dopamine and adrenaline, which contribute to that elevated feeling many experience after drinking coffee.” Caffeine is so effective for boosting energy that oral caffeine is actually an FDA-approved treatment for restoring mental alertness or wakefulness in people experiencing fatigue or drowsiness, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Library of Medicine" data-node-id="3.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-19jy3s emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N." data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian based in New Orleans; Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D., C.D.C.E.S., C.D.N., a preventive cardiology dietitian at &lt;a href="http://entirelynourished.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://entirelynourished.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="EntirelyNourished.com" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;EntirelyNourished.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Another reason caffeine is so effective for increasing energy is that it has nearly 100% bioavailability, per the NLM, which means your body absorbs every milligram in your cup of coffee. Plus, it is quickly broken down and distributed to the brain, reaching peak concentration between 30 minutes and two hours after consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now, knowing all that, when is the best time to drink coffee?

The remaining samples were from age- and sex-matched healthy and neurotypical children, providing a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;The People in Your Life Are Sharing Their Gut Microbes With You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of two dominant groups of microbes in the human gut, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroidota"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillota"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was higher across all three disorder groups than was typically seen in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This increase in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;, especially in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ASD&lt;/a&gt;, and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, particularly in ADHD and AN, corresponds with findings in inflammatory diseases, where altered ratios have been linked to glucose metabolism, inflammation, and satiety regulation," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ADHD and autism groups, the richness of microbiome species was lower than usual. The researchers measured higher levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, microbes that typically hang out in our body without causing damage, yet cause serious infections when elevated in numbers or migrate out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desulfovibrio"&gt;Desulfovibrio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bacteria were more abundant in children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa. These bacteria are known for living in low-nutrient, waterlogged environments, where they reduce sulfate as a source of energy. They also commonly reside in the human gut, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11071772"&gt;at low levels,&lt;/a&gt; potentially causing disease when they grow out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa both harbored fewer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faecalibacterium"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than their peers. This bacterium is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.06.003"&gt;usually quite abundant&lt;/a&gt; in healthy human microbiomes, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuad039"&gt;lower levels have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with inflammatory conditions like irritable bowel disease, colorectal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Notably, certain resemblances were observed in the microbiotic taxa abundances across all patient cohorts, underscoring the conceivable influence of gut microbiota composition on the behavioral manifestations of mental disorders," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/halloween-candy-can-overload-your-gut-microbiome-expert-warns"&gt;diet has a direct impact&lt;/a&gt; on the diversity and species that make up our gut microbiomes: less variety on the menu typically means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;less variety&lt;/a&gt; in our gut flora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picky, slow, and restrictive or excessive eating are common &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361321995631"&gt;among children with autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251314223"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; due to sensory issues, and deliberate food restriction is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/disordered-eating-vs-eating-disorders-whats-the-difference"&gt;defining feature of anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;. Similarities in the gut microbiomes of these children may arise from their limited diets. Changes to the gut microbiome can also exacerbate mental health problems, and these, in turn, may impact the gut, further contributing to a positive-feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note their plans for this research were disrupted by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, significantly limiting data collection and resulting in the small sample size here. They also note that some children were not keen on cooperating with their parents in collecting stool samples, further limiting the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given these limitations, our findings should be interpreted with caution," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;they write&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear, for instance, whether these gut profiles contribute to the children's conditions, are a result of them, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hope future studies can replicate their methods with a much larger sample size to gather more reliable profiles of gut microbiomes in children with these disorders, which &lt;span&gt;could one day &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-identifies-gut-microbe-imbalances-that-predict-autism-and-adhd"&gt;help with diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"We want residents to be aware, watch for symptoms, and make sure they're protected with the MMR vaccine. Community awareness and quick action to limit exposures are key to preventing additional cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge anyone who thinks they were exposed to a measles carrier to watch for symptoms linked to the virus for 21 days after a possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that starts on the head or face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Utah Health Department says anyone who suspects they've been infected with measles should stay home and call their health care provider before seeking care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials remind the public that the best way to prevent the illness is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two doses of MMR prevent more than 97% of infections. The vaccine is widely available through health care providers, pharmacies, and (Central Utah Health Department) clinics," the department said in its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The treatment increased Proffitt’s chances of survival by 87 percent over the next five years, and by 57 percent over the next 10 years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three rounds of the treatment were approved in late September, but the full course of 14 rounds was initially denied, according to Proffitt and records reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They don't care that I'm an employee,” said Proffitt, who works as a data program manager in the team that supports Aetna’s Medicaid customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They don't care that I'm a cancer patient.

We collaborated closely with her healthcare provider, and after additional medical information was submitted, the claims were approved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We recognize how complex healthcare decisions can be,” the spokesperson continued. “And we remain firmly committed to ensuring that every member - including our own employees - receives a fair, transparent, and clinically appropriate review of their care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I was not prepared to fight with insurance’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like Proffitt, mom-of-four Amy Logan, of Muncie, Indiana, found herself exasperated after back-and-forths with her insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, over critical treatments ordered by her oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Is your plan for me to die?” she said she asked a&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-steps-down-stock-131750616.html" data-ylk="slk:UnitedHealthcare;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt; rep on the phone at one particularly low point. “Is that the solution?

But the crucial treatment was initially denied after UnitedHealth questioned the number of sessions her doctors said she needed, at first deeming it not “medically necessary,” Logan said, showing &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; paperwork to back up her claim&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You hear all the time, ‘You have to fight for your life,’” Logan said of battling cancer. “And I expected to fight not feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I expected to fight just having to get up and function and eat food when I didn't want to — and fight to go to the doctor because I was exhausted,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I wasn't expecting to fight with insurance. That's something you just aren't prepared for, and a system that doesn't feel designed to help you in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After appealing the decision, Logan was informed the radiation therapy was approved on Nov. 3 and she is now receiving the course recommended by specialists at the world-renowned University of Texas&lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/inflammatory-breast-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MD Anderson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; MD Anderson&lt;/a&gt; Cancer Center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while she is relieved with the outcome, Logan desperately wanted to be home this Thanksgiving with her husband, Joshua, and their four children, ages 4, 9, 17 and 20, but the delays to her treatment mean she will be 1,000 miles away in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaying “is not really an option for me,” said Logan, who explained that even with all the treatments, there is still an approximate 35 percent chance the cancer will return within the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Logan wants this Thanksgiving is to be at home in Muncie, Indiana, with her husband Joshua and their four children, aged 4, 9, 17 and 20, but delays mean she will be 1,000 miles away in the hospital (Amy Logan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She teared up thinking about how much time the cancer has already robbed from her as a mother to her four kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I've missed a year of birthdays,” she said. “Chemo itself is exhausting, the travel is exhausting — I don't think I was able to experience my kids very well this year. I couldn't go play, I couldn't get out of bed. I’m just so ready to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Asked about Logan’s experience, a UnitedHealthcare spokesperson said the company “empathized” with anyone going through cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We empathize with anyone facing a cancer diagnosis and are committed to communicating coverage decisions clearly and promptly,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;“Ms. Logan’s radiation treatment was approved under our policy, which is based on medical society guidelines including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society for Radiation Oncology and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Her provider was offered a peer-to-peer review with one of our radiation oncologists to discuss her treatment plan in more detail,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both women ended up receiving the full course of treatment prescribed by their specialist medical teams, but said they had to jump through hoops to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, Logan and Proffitt both claimed they were saddled with additional bills in error, running into the thousands, which exacerbated their stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Proffitt said she is still in dispute with Aetna over a $4,000 bill for a white blood cell injection she required after chemotherapy, which she claimed was initially approved before her insurer pulled it from her coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In response, Aetna said it was “reviewing any outstanding claims to ensure they are processed appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Logan, meanwhile, had to contest a $53,000 bill she received — in a filing error. It was not clear whether UnitedHealthcare or the healthcare provider was at fault, but ultimately the error was corrected and she didn’t have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Doctors also frustrated: ‘It’s just a delay tactic’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s not just patients who are fed up with the insurance red tape — doctors find themselves spending a significant amount of time doing battle with health insurers over prior authorization on behalf of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delays have consequences, especially when treating aggressive cancers, Dr Amar Rewari, chief of radiation oncology at Luminis Health, told &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Amar Rewari, chief of radiation oncology at Luminis Health and an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins, spoke of the frustrations he has dealt with prior authorization (Lauren Barkume Photography/Amar Rewari)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is critical that cancer patients get their treatment in a timely manner,” said Rewari, who is also an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins and on the board of directors for the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). “Because the thing is, any delays can cause negative outcomes in terms of less likelihood for cure, as well as the treatment not working.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Shruti Patel, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford University and a gastrointestinal medical oncologist, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The range of consequences goes from patients being anxious about getting started on treatment to progression of disease, where their cancer can go from curable to incurable,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patel said there is no “blanket” rule for how quickly cancer patients must receive treatment, but the vast majority of tumors are fast-growing and time is of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Getting started on treatment is imperative,” she said. “And when things are essentially delayed, you are potentially changing [a patient’s] outcome and making their cancer care journey worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rewari said that his Maryland clinic has had to hire additional staff to handle the mountain of administration that comes with prior authorization, which he has to submit for everything from initial PET and MRI scans to a course of radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Shruti Patel, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford University and a gastrointestinal medical oncologist, said she spends a lot of her time fighting for patients on the phone with insurance companies (Shruti Patel)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If I try to order a PET scan or an MRI, insurance companies will often fight me on it and say, ‘Oh, does this patient really need these expensive scans?’ And so they'll sometimes deny it, which obviously causes a lot of stress for the patient,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of it is just purely delays, because they know that doctors are busy, and so they're not going to have time to fight it,” said Rewari, who discusses insurance barriers to care and more on his healthcare podcast &lt;em&gt;Value Health Voices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patel shared a story of a cancer patient whose care was particularly complex because she was also pregnant. Because of radiation risks to the fetus, the patient could not have a CT scan but required a PET scan and an MRI, which are more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We really needed to get this done. I kind of thought, no matter what I would order that it would get approved, because this is such a rare case,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They got denied,” Patel said, adding that she then spent hours on the phone trying to jump through numerous hoops with the insurer, who she did not identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 8 in 10 doctors said that the prior authorization burden is growing worse, reporting that it increased greatly (60 percent) or somewhat (25 percent) in the past three years, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.astro.org/ASTRO/media/ASTRO/News%20and%20Publications/PDFs/PriorAuthSurvey_2024ExecutiveSummary.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 ASTRO study.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; 2024 ASTRO study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rewari attributes rising costs as one of the drivers behind the trend and said that, as a result, companies are relying on a process called utilization management — mechanisms insurance companies implement to control costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They're really investing heavily in that, which is, in other words, a way of reducing the expenses,” he said. “It’s just a delay tactic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;‘Current system is complex and incredibly inefficient’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Alexandra Zaleta, vice president of research and insights at the nonprofit CancerCare, oversaw a&lt;a href="https://media.cancercare.org/documents/407/original/CancerCare_RedTape_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:major study published this year a;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; major study published this year a&lt;/a&gt;bout how cancer patients “get lost in the health insurance maze” while trying to cope with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The report found that 87 percent of patients on employer plans typically experienced prior authorizations more than those on Medicare Advantage (72 percent) and traditional Medicare plans (57 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Zaleta said the current American health insurance system was incredibly complex and “inefficient” when it comes to cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the one in 10 patients who received a denial, 88 percent appealed the decision.

Of these, 55 percent appealed once, 29 percent appealed twice, and 13 percent appealed three or more times. Nearly three out of four appeals eventually resulted in a decision reversal (72 percent), and 73 percent said the insurer fast-tracked the appeal due to the life-threatening nature of their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Still, many respondents faced long waits for treatment because of the prior authorization process,” the report found. “Among those who appealed, one in three (33 percent) reported the entire approval process, including appeals, took one month or more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Advocacy groups are calling for urgent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There's been an awareness of this problem for at least the last decade,” Zaleta said. “But whatever solutions or approaches are being implemented are not moving the needle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individual states have taken action on prior authorization this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/news-initiatives/policy-news-analysis/states-lead-prior-authorization-reform" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Society of Clinical Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology &lt;/a&gt;tracked over 110 bills on the subject in 40 states during the 2025 legislative session, with many including calls to improve insurer response times and require companies to be more transparent about approvals, but federal reform has not yet been enacted into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For cancer patients, change can’t come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I try to stay optimistic but it is really hard,” said Logan . “How many delays can I go through?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9ud1VZMnhsZkFOcVNRakoxTkxtb1M5c2pVbGFzWVlkZzNiTnVNQ0RDcTRqNjd6UGdmclNXM3ZfRmNiQmdQUlBSbTNTLWJhOERkeWVnaHpvSVY5cUpjNm5POVF1R0tYYjFJSS1UaXYtUk0xbUYzNm40dmVGMjRsc0k</guid></item><item><title>8种可能帮助您长寿的地中海饮食食品- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-foods-to-help-you-live-longer-11849104</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more legumes, like beans, chickpeas and soybeans, is a powerful way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898812/how-food-can-help-you-look-and-feel-more-youthful-heres-what-the-science-says/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;promote longevity&lt;/a&gt;. But don’t overlook lentils. “Lentils are rich in plant-based protein, fiber and polyphenols, which together help reduce inflammation, support stable blood sugar levels and promote a healthy gut microbiome—key factors linked to longer, healthier lives,” says &lt;a href="https://fueledbyleo.clientsecure.me/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leonila Campos, M.B.A., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “Their folate, magnesium and potassium content also supports cardiovascular health, one of the strongest predictors of longevity.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Legumes, like lentils, are budget-friendly and shelf-stable, says &lt;a href="https://www.mynutritionandme.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karolin Saweres, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “[They are also] one of the simplest ways to shift toward a more plant-forward, heart-healthy eating pattern that supports long-term health and longevity,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Need cooking inspo? “Stir lentils into soups or pasta sauces, use them in grain bowls or make a warm lentil stew for a hearty plant-based meal,” recommends Saweres.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts are the ultimate snack. They’re full of healthy fats, plant protein and fiber,” says Berger. Some research shows that eating about 1.5 ounces of nuts per day as part of a heart-healthy diet can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating nuts daily is also linked with healthier aging among older folks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because what’s good for your heart tends to also be good for your brain, nuts may additionally protect cognitive function as you age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you can always snack on a handful. But why stop there? “Toss them into salads, yogurt or just grab a handful when life gets nutty,” says Berger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of the Mediterranean diet, olive oil is probably one of the first foods that comes to mind. Indeed, this healthful oil is linked with a plethora of benefits that may lead to a longer, more vital life. “Extra-virgin olive oil is like liquid gold for your body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nourishwithdrkari.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kari Hamrick, Ph.D., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “It is rich in antioxidants and healthy fats that protect your heart, fight inflammation and nourish every cell,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While olive oil’s heart-healthy fats get most of the attention, this oil is also rich in beneficial compounds called polyphenols. “The polyphenols found in olive oil are believed to promote longevity by helping to protect against inflammation and cognitive decline, while also supporting healthy metabolic function,” says &lt;a href="https://elizabethharrisnutrition.com/meet-elizabeth" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elizabeth Harris, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one fruit that’s practically synonymous with the Mediterranean diet, it’s pomegranates. These ruby-red fruits are full of antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and minerals. No wonder they’ve been shown to help protect against cancer and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They may also be beneficial for long-term blood sugar management, says Leatherwood. “If you’re looking for a new fruit to try, pomegranates stand out for their well-documented mechanism of enhancing insulin sensitivity,” she explains. That makes them one of the more diabetes-friendly fruits out there, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is one of the best sources of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;long-chain omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, unique polyunsaturated fats linked to heart and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The omega-3s in salmon may also help extend your lifespan. For instance, one study found that consuming 1,000 milligrams of omega-3s per day may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-slow-aging-11793621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow biological aging&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Considering that just 3 ounces of cooked salmon contains between 1,500 and 1,800 mg of omega-3s, salmon is a slam dunk for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-pantry-staples-for-healthy-aging-11730036" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following a Mediterranean diet can help you age with grace, and it may even help you live longer. This healthy eating pattern is rich in fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, whole grains, seeds, fatty fish and olive oil. But if you’re looking for the best Mediterranean diet foods that may help you live longer, think broccoli, leafy greens, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, nuts, lentils, pomegranates, salmon and, of course, olive oil. They’ve been shown to protect against a long list of age-related illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cognitive decline. So, stock up today to extend your lifespan for years to come!&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why strength training is best for your knees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows aerobic exercise, such as swimming, cycling or walking, is important for those with osteoarthritis to help &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/natural-ways-to-relieve-arthritis-pain/"&gt;reduce pain&lt;/a&gt; and improve quality of life, a strength training routine is crucial if you want to boost your knee health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to have to do something weight-bearing to help the knees,” she explains. This is because compressive forces – which put downward pressure on the knee – stimulate the growth of cartilage cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key is to try and maximise the amount of compressive force you’re getting through the joints, while minimising gliding forces [forward and backward motion].” Working the knee in this way is key to preventing and easing any pain that occurs in or around the joint, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/matt-roberts-best-exercises-strengthen-knees/"&gt;strengthening the main muscle groups of the knees&lt;/a&gt; – your quads, hamstring, calves and glutes – give you better control of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can strengthen those muscle groups, you’re going to keep your knees healthier. That’s whether you’ve got no damage at all, wear and tear or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/foods-help-arthritis-symptoms/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the best three exercises you can do for your knees, according to Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most useful exercise is squats,” Macdonald says. “They can sound intimidating but, fundamentally, it’s just standing up and sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really simple movement pattern but you get serious bang for your buck with it. You’ve got your weight going through both legs; it’s a really safe thing to do; you’ve got compression of the cartilage; the concentration of the quad muscles in your upper thigh; glute activity; and, more broadly, you’re getting a cardiovascular workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to do squats if you have no knee pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with your feet pointing straight forward, keeping your chest and core engaged. Next, bend your knees, going down into a sitting position, until your thighs are nearly parallel with the ground. Allow the knees to move forward, over the centre of your feet.&lt;/p&gt;

            The United States may be heading into its second severe flu season in a row, driven by a mutated strain called subclade K that’s behind early surges in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00022e6ft0anr0jv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last winter’s season was extreme, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The US had &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2839724" target="_blank"&gt;its highest rates&lt;/a&gt; of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;280 children died of influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00032e6fxahxk6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00042e6fie4bakk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest FluView report&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00062e6ftpq3qx8l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00072e6f4we6ksc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00082e6fr1hft3se@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00092e6fopkchlv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000a2e6fy0u4w9u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000b2e6fbfs6nfnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ynbrk00033b6qw9uhjq2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi4h9ull00002e6f4valxrnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000c2e6f900nm9hy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000d2e6fqm51il2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000e2e6f4k9arot4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000f2e6f0nmeyxyj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/gp-news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/october-2025/australia-posts-record-breaking-flu-numbers-as-vac" target="_blank"&gt;have also fallen&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with &lt;a href="https://nindss.health.gov.au/pbi-dashboard/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 443,000 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000g2e6flj4i5bbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000h2e6fhbfmji3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000i2e6fdv3vb6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the severity is also worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ya77p00002e6fhvg21jlp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000j2e6ftdxcoq3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ysxp500053b6q4ybr387l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company anonymously compiles its test results into a &lt;a href="https://syndromictrends.com/" target="_blank"&gt;syndromic surveillance tool&lt;/a&gt;, which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000k2e6f1zfy2bzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000l2e6fq8zw1ye8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signals &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjcQACABSABaC0luZmx1ZW56YSBBcgoyMDI1LTEwLTA2cgoyMDI1LTExLTE3igEGYTc3NzdjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=a7777c" target="_blank"&gt;are also rising&lt;/a&gt; in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000m2e6fzwjx3fo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000n2e6fnifoulpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000o2e6fv0wsin8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000p2e6fjkwaldxn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Those polyps may be removed if they’re detected early. But if they’re not, they may grow and turn into cancer, the researchers point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/providers/tiago-biachi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a medical oncologist in the Gastrointestinal Oncology Department at Moffitt Cancer Center; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/tracey-childs-1114999489" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracey Childs, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tracey Childs, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., colon and rectal surgeon, chief of surgery at Providence Saint John’s Health Center and adjunct associate professor of surgery at Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Results of this study suggest that reducing ultra-processed food intake may be an effective dietary strategy to prevent early-onset colorectal tumorigenesis,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The results don’t definitively conclude that ultra-processed foods are fueling the risk of colorectal cancer cases in young people, but they do raise some questions.

This scale breaks them into these main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods are in their natural state or barely altered. They include things like bananas, carrots, and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: These include ingredients created through minimal processing—pressing, refining, grinding, or milling.

Most packaged foods are considered ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might ultra-processed foods raise the risk of colon cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers didn’t dive into why ultra-processed foods may raise the risk of polyps (and, eventually, colon cancer). However, there are a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s possible that ultra-processed foods change the intestinal microbiome, explains &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/tracey-childs-1114999489" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracey Childs, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tracey Childs, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., colon and rectal surgeon, chief of surgery at Providence Saint John’s Health Center, and adjunct associate professor of surgery at Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA. That may lead to unhealthy changes that could allow cancerous cells to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These foods may also encourage inflammation in the gut, which may raise the risk of pre-cancerous changes—that can then lead to early-onset colon cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/providers/tiago-biachi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a medical oncologist in the Gastrointestinal Oncology Department at Moffitt Cancer Center, agrees, noting that “gut microbiome disruption and chronic inflammation” are likely behind this. “The findings highlight ultra-processed foods as a modifiable risk factor in the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer among younger women,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Childs points out that the study isn’t perfect—it relies on people recalling what they ate, which isn’t always accurate. It’s also a little general about its definition of ultra-processed foods and doesn’t dive into which types may be more linked to colon cancer risk than others, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Dr. Childs says that the findings aren’t shocking. “We know that processed foods aren’t good for you, and this just may be another way they’re not good for you,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Biachi points out that 20% of colorectal cancers are based on genetic risk factors—but that 80% appear to be sparked by environmental, lifestyle, microbial, and early-life exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How to help prevent colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Biachi recommends people focus on eating a whole food diet, doing their best to limit ultra-processed foods to three or fewer servings a day. “Exercise, protect your microbiome with fermented and prebiotic foods, and use minimal antibiotics,” he says. Dr. Biachi also suggests doing your best to limit alcohol, get seven-plus hours of sleep a night, and try to practice good oral hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, Dr. Biachi stresses the importance of staying on top of your gut health. “Start screening [for colorectal cancer] at age 45 or earlier with family history or multiple risk factors,” he says. “Never ignore red-flag symptoms—rectal bleeding, persistent pain, anemia, bowel changes, and weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you develop any of these symptoms or just have overall concerns about your gut health, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUDZHS2xacG5VZF8xZVgweWM2blFhZmk0SGdXRFdBMElIMnhYeXg4Ym1QeFVtZzJ6OFo1eUlfQnNhYm1ZTkREU0lNVDI0aGJFWVd0eloteVhrN3BxdWhmbDNuYzFhb3ZzcmQ1cXczMk9EbC05aTZ6MWpoU0FUVkNJLU9fSGVZSHZaSm1fZGE1UQ</guid></item><item><title>Amla to til laddoos ：医生分享今年冬天避免感染的最佳食物-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/amla-to-til-laddoos-doctor-shares-best-foods-to-eat-to-avoid-cold-cough-flu-infections-this-winter/articleshow/125404139.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter sets in, the body works harder to maintain its core temperature. This added metabolic demand can temporarily strain the immune system, making us more vulnerable to common infections like cold, cough and seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we eat plays a crucial role in keeping our energy stable and building our natural defences.

But guess what? A humble kitchen spice might offer similar slimming benefits, sans the needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial led by Osaka Metropolitan University researchers found that black cumin seeds, a common kitchen spice, may offer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.70888" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;anti-obesity benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

Now, a clinical study by Osaka Metropolitan University suggests that it also has anti-obesity benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Inside Ozempic: Does the drug really help in weight loss and what are its possible side effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the anti-obesity effects of black cumin seeds, the researchers conducted cellular experiments and human clinical trials. The team was led by Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa of the Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were given 5 g of black cumin seed powder daily, roughly a tablespoon, for 8 weeks during the human clinical trial. The researchers found that cumin seeds led to a significant reduction in blood triglycerides, LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noticed HDL (‘good’) cholesterol levels increasing. Improvements in these blood lipid profiles are linked to a lower risk of heart problems and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How black cumin works against fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research did not stop there. They conducted cellular experiments to understand the mechanism behind the spice’s anti-obesity effects. They found that black cumin seed extract inhibited adipogenesis, the formation and maturation of fat cells, by blocking both fat droplet accumulation and the differentiation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study strongly suggests that black cumin seeds are useful as a functional food for preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases. It was so gratifying to see black cumin comprehensively demonstrate actual, demonstrable blood lipid-lowering effects in a human trial,” Professor Kojima-Yuasa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to perform longer-term and larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the effects of black cumin on metabolism. We are particularly interested in investigating its effects on insulin resistance in diabetes and inflammatory markers,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These promising results could pave the way for new, science-backed approaches to managing weight using everyday dietary ingredients. In the near future, your doctor might recommend keeping a jar of black cumin seeds alongside your vitamins. You might have to go on a grocery run instead of waiting in line at the pharmacy!
