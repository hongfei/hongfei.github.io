Hormone therapy promises relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many women wonder about taking it. That’s because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, has long been shrouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today’s hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,” said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment’s pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions — prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women — and it’s important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what’s best.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;How hormone therapy works &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Because it’s applied into the vagina, very little circulates in the blood and the risks are far lower. Doctors say it’s a good option for women whose biggest complaint is vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-body therapy includes pills, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms like hot flashes. Such systemic hormones include estrogens and progestogens.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zwink, a nurse in Castle Rock, Colorado, began using an estrogen patch more than a year ago and also has an IUD, which gives her progesterone. The treatment has relieved her hot flashes, improved her sleep and eased her joint pain and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like a 100% magic wand,” she said. “But it definitely has made a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Menopause Society says hormone therapy can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease if started within 10 years of reaching menopause. It may also reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and maintain bone density for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might have a drop in their bone density at age 60" instead of at age 50, said Dr. MargEva Morris Cole, an OB-GYN with Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Hormone therapy carries some risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Leverenz was first prescribed hormone therapy last year, she kept worrying about the risks she’d heard about — then finally decided: “I can’t live like this anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a combination of three medications, her anxiety lifted, her sleep improved, her joint pain and hot flashes went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like myself again,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say many patients hesitate to try hormones, and they try to reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women can use estrogen therapy for seven years – and estrogen-progestogen therapy for three to five years – before breast cancer risk goes up, according to the Menopause Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group says both estrogen therapy and estrogen-progestogen therapy increase the risk of stroke, which goes away soon after stopping hormones. The risk of blood clots rises if you take hormones by mouth, but may be lower if you use a patch, gel or spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these risks are small,” said Dr. Nanette Santoro, an OB-GYN at the University of Colorado. “And they have to be weighed against the benefit of symptom relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, medical history and how long women stay on the hormones are also considerations. Many women take them for around five years, and those who’ve had a stroke or certain other conditions may be advised against using them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Debate on changing warnings on hormone medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are divided over whether there should be changes in “black box” health warnings on some hormone treatments. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the physicians at the recent expert panel meeting convened by the FDA prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label. A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that “removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk,” and asked the agency to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, doctors urge people to be wary of misinformation, like false claims on social media posts that hormones will prevent dementia and ensure a healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t say that you are going to live a longer, healthier life because you took hormones,” Duke’s Cole said. “I don’t want the pendulum to go so far that people feel that it is promising health for the next 30 to 40 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to hormone therapy for menopause &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro pointed to a new non-hormonal medication called fezolinetant, marketed as Veozah, for hot flashes and night sweats. The anti-epileptic medication gabapentin, in low doses, can also be used for hot flashes and a moisturizer can improve vaginal dryness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also say regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro urged against the “wild proliferation” of supplements claiming to be menopause cure-alls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody is in on the menopause gold rush,” she said. “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering," Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore," Fello said. "We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A "first-of-its-kind technology"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/stroke-treatment-vivistim/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vivistim System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf21/P210007B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They regulate the body's involuntary functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in "greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors," Nossek said in emailed remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use," Nossek said. "This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 108-person trial &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00475-X/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published in The Lancet in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have "moderate to severe deficits" qualify for the device, the company &lt;a href="https://microtransponder.showpad.com/share/D0VkrCHvDXiqoQf11CiVP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implant aids in recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with "less than 1% chance of any complications." Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't "something he could have done before." Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The sky's the limit"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/robotic-coach-offer-new-hope-for-stroke-patients-on-the-road-to-recovery/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;other new technologies&lt;/a&gt; may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back," Bain said. "In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;shared a map&lt;/a&gt; that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back," Covey said. "This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down." &lt;/p&gt;

Since my husband’s mother found out, she has made it her personal mission to put a halt to the event.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmen5dsn9001r3b79sdr98tgt@published"&gt;She claims that we are “inviting disaster” by holding it and accepting gifts for our baby before he arrives. I have told her that if she is not comfortable attending, that’s fine, but she doesn’t get to decide for me. Her response has been to tell me to go ahead, but “don’t be surprised when the baby is stillborn.” I’ve had enough. She is really starting to cast a pall over what should be a happy occasion. My husband tells me she’s always been superstitious and to just ignore her. Easy for him to say—he’s not the one who’s pregnant! How can I convince him that he needs to get his mother to keep her opinions to herself?&lt;/p&gt;

Or, at any rate, I wouldn’t bother, because even if you convinced &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, he’d still have to convince her. (And if his response to you is that you ought to ignore her—presumably that’s what he does—I am pretty sure he knows he won’t be able to convince her. Not to mention that he doesn’t want to be bothered trying.)&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve already told her where you stand; she’s blown right by that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; escalated things. Someone who tells you your baby is going to be stillborn is not someone you need to hear from. So stop speaking to her altogether until after the baby is born. I wouldn’t even make a production of it: I’d just say, “Oh, sorry, can’t talk now” whenever she calls—or not pick up the phone when you see it’s her. If she stops in for a visit, you’ll be just on your way out.&lt;/p&gt;

If she complains about your freeze-out to her son—and she will—that’s his chance to say something to her, which is what you wanted in the first place. If nothing else, he can explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re icing her out. That conversation will be good for both of them. Will it change her? Doubtful. But the most important outcome of this is that you won’t have to listen to the dreadful things she has to say anymore. And you can keep this strategy in your back pocket for after the baby is born, if she tries to get under your skin then too. You are under no obligation to put up with her (or anyone’s) bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

My very good friend, let’s call her Stacy, was married years ago, to a man whose niece had a daughter at 16. My friend and her husband stepped up and took care of the baby most days for 18 months, until the birth mother came to them and announced that she just couldn’t do it anymore. They ended up adopting the baby. A couple years later, the birth mom came to them with the fact that she was pregnant again. Stacy and her husband adopted this baby at birth. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/03/adoption-disclosure-teenagers-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;They raised both girls for the next two years before divorcing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potassium absorption isn't significantly affected by when you eat a banana.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The body naturally balances potassium levels based on intake and current needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A varied, nutrient-rich diet is more important than banana timing for potassium benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas are a go-to snack for good reason: they’re convenient, tasty and packed with nutrients. There’s no denying that bananas are an excellent source of potassium. A medium-sized banana is loaded with around 420 mg of potassium, which is about 12 to 16 percent of your daily needs (2,600 mg for females and 3,400 mg for males).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is a mineral and electrolyte that plays some very important roles in supporting overall health. It helps keep your body hydrated, supports cell and nerve functioning and maintains healthy muscle and heart function, yet most Americans don’t get enough of it each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re aiming to get the biggest potassium benefit from your banana, does the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when you eat it actually matter? We asked registered dietitians to weigh in—and the answer might surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-banana-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Banana Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth be told, there is no single “best time” or “worst time” to eat a banana for maximum potassium intake. This is because timing doesn’t have much of an impact on potassium absorption, as opposed to other nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our body absorbs potassium passively, like a sponge,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Once it has absorbed enough or reached an optimal level, absorption becomes limited.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, your body’s pretty good at figuring out what it needs, regardless of when you eat potassium-rich foods. When you eat a banana, your body will figure out what to do that’s best in the moment to maintain a nutritional equilibrium so you don’t experience any negative symptoms, like low blood pressure, dizziness or muscle aches,” says &lt;a href="https://tracynutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-influences-potassium-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Influences Potassium Absorption? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is absorbed in the small intestine, and your body generally does a good job of using what you consume. But certain factors can affect potassium levels—like high sodium intake, some medications, vomiting or diarrhea and underlying health conditions that impact how your body retains or excretes potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of potassium levels like a see-saw, Beckerman says. “If you are eating foods that are putting too much potassium into your body, excretion will be high, so levels remain stable,” she says. “If intake is too low, excretion will be low, so it is conserved in the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The kidneys do much of this balancing act. If your potassium stores are low, your body will hold on to the necessary amount of potassium when you eat potassium-rich foods. But if your potassium levels are appropriate, your body will excrete the excess through the urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other nutrients you eat with bananas don't have much of an impact on potassium absorption. “Potassium acts alone as an electrolyte that does its own thing, regardless if it’s ingested with other macronutrients like proteins, fat and carbohydrates,” Beckerman says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-the-most-potassium-from-your-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get the Most Potassium from Your Bananas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of stressing over banana timing, focus on building a nutrient-rich eating pattern. “Eating a variety of whole plant foods supports a balanced diet that promotes heart and overall health, while also helping regulate healthy potassium levels in conjunction with other nutrients,” Han says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, bananas aren’t the only potassium heroes. Other potassium-rich foods to include are potatoes, Swiss chard and spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another tip: keep your sodium in check. Potassium and sodium work together in the body, so maintaining a healthy sodium level can help your body maintain the right balance between sodium and potassium in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re aiming to get the best potassium benefit from eating bananas, the time you choose to eat one does not really matter. Potassium absorption tends to be efficient regardless of timing. Bananas can help support your body’s potassium needs, whether you eat them morning, evening, or mid-day. Rather than stressing over the perfect time to eat a banana for maximum potassium benefits, focus on getting enough potassium-rich foods in your diet.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;What if you could fix your damaged eye without having to shoot a laser at it? Scientists have potentially discovered a novel method of repairing the cornea, similar to LASIK, that wouldn’t require a laser or other invasive surgical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Occidental College and the University of California, Irvine, created the technique, which aims to temporarily make the cornea malleable. In experiments with rabbit eyeballs, their method appeared to work while also leaving corneal cells alive. More research is needed to vet the procedure, but if all goes well, it could become a preferred alternative to LASIK, the researchers claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a long road between what we’ve done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,” said lead researcher Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, in a &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/august/an-alternative-to-lasik-without-the-lasers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Chemical Society.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why some people avoid LASIK&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used to treat conditions like myopia, farsightedness, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea—the transparent, outer layer of the eye that captures and focuses light onto the retina—using a precise cutting laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though generally safe and effective, the surgery does permanently weaken the structural integrity of the cornea. People will also commonly experience side effects like dry eye and visual disturbances like halos; a small few will even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319231/"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; serious, if rare, complications like chronic nerve pain. Ideally, the team’s method would avoid these risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potentially safer method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is called electromechanical reshaping. Some of the authors had previously used it to manipulate other parts of the body that contain collagen and water, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5008912/"&gt;ears&lt;/a&gt;. It works by altering the pH of the tissue via short bursts of electricity, briefly allowing it to be molded as desired. Once the proper pH is restored, the tissue returns to its original rigid state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers used the technique on rabbit eyeballs in the lab, some of which were intended to represent myopia in humans. Special contact lenses made from platinum were placed over the extracted eyes. These lenses served as an electrode, providing a base for how the cornea should be correctly reshaped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the researchers lightly zapped the eye, the cornea became flexible and contoured to the shape of the lens. Not only did the cornea fill out as the researchers wanted, but the procedure didn’t seem to kill any corneal cells or otherwise affect the cornea’s stability. A YouTube video describing the team’s approach, from the American Chemical Society, can be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbJWbUt0m0"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers admit that it will take more research in animals before they can even think about testing their method in humans. Their next planned step is to try out the procedure on living rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the potential for the team’s work is certainly there, and it may extend beyond treating myopia. The researchers are also hoping to explore whether electromechanical reshaping can help repair farsightedness, astigmatism, and possibly even some forms of cloudy vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as has been the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/odds-winning-nih-grants-plummet-new-funding-policy-and-spending-delays-bite"&gt;case for many scientists&lt;/a&gt; during the second Trump administration, the researchers say their work has been delayed over concerns in securing additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="19a955fe-676b-4680-ae59-0ca1ec76fecc"&gt;Missing your morning coffee is a headache — literally. Though caffeine is often used to kick-start a day or deliver an energy boost, a sudden drop in consumption can cause painful headaches. And for those trying to kick a coffee habit entirely, the pain can be particularly agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caffeine withdrawal headaches can be surprisingly intense," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/nolan-pearson-5036486.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/nolan-pearson-5036486.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Nolan Pearson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and headache specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, told Live Science. "It can trigger a migraine-type headache, so it can be pulsing, pounding, throbbing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="19a955fe-676b-4680-ae59-0ca1ec76fecc-2"&gt;But why is caffeine withdrawal so excruciating? Neurologists still aren't entirely sure, but they have a few theories and some tips on how to treat these nasty headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8e1f1892-402e-4817-b8d8-98d85bc05a5f"&gt;Caffeine withdrawal headaches occur after a person consumes more than 200 milligrams of caffeine — the amount in about two cups of coffee — per day for more than two weeks and then abruptly stops, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ichd-3.org/8-headache-attributed-to-a-substance-or-its-withdrawal/8-3-headache-attributed-to-substance-withdrawal/8-3-1-caffeine-withdrawal-headache/" target="_blank" data-url="https://ichd-3.org/8-headache-attributed-to-a-substance-or-its-withdrawal/8-3-headache-attributed-to-substance-withdrawal/8-3-1-caffeine-withdrawal-headache/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Classification of Headache Disorders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ICHD-3). The headaches usually appear within 24 hours without caffeine, and typically go away within one week or when caffeine is consumed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why withdrawal headaches are so painful remains somewhat unclear. Because caffeine affects many parts of the body, experts haven't been able to pin down a single overarching cause. But the pain likely comes, in part, from dilated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f2e9421c-28e6-4477-9f0f-ea482efeb276"&gt;Caffeine constricts blood vessels — which is part of the reason why the drug can also, paradoxically, be used to relieve some types of headaches, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When caffeine use stops, those blood vessels swell, causing more blood flow and, therefore, pain. But &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Brian McGeeney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and headache specialist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said that's just one contributing cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's involved, but it's not the whole story," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does caffeine help or cause headaches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation for caffeine withdrawal headaches has to do with adenosine receptors. The drug blocks adenosine, a building block of RNA, from attaching to receptors scattered across the central nervous system. This causes neurons to fire more quickly and blood vessels to constrict, which, in turn, makes people feel more alert and awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone stops consuming caffeine, the sudden buildup of adenosine in the body can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contribute to withdrawal headaches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is also why caffeine is commonly used to treat headaches: By blocking adenosine receptors, it prevents blood vessel dilation from the outset. In fact, caffeine can make painkillers like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work more efficiently, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as Pearson noted, much of caffeine withdrawal is yet to be explained. "We certainly don't know, but these are all reasons why it might be causing headaches," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine withdrawal often &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;happens in hospital settings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when patients have to quit their coffee habit to undergo a medical procedure. Some studies also show caffeine withdrawal symptoms in people who fast, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as Muslims observing Ramadan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When life is interrupted unpredictably, like you end up in the emergency room or get admitted to hospital, you see a lot of caffeine withdrawal," McGeeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="14e124de-9b23-4a64-bee2-5ef125afdd98"&gt;Caffeine is usually &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;safe in moderation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But when someone is looking to reduce or eliminate their caffeine intake, experts agree that the best strategy is to cut down gradually. Drink a little less each day, or substitute lower-caffeine alternatives, like tea, to make the transition easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody's using caffeine chronically and they want to cut back, I would do it quite gradually," Pearson said. "So no faster than about 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine reduced per day — that's a quarter to half a cup of coffee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a headache lasts longer than a week, Pearson recommended seeking medical care, as that time frame suggests the headache may be triggered by something other than caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The systematic review looked at self-reported data from more than 30 million people and found that those who exercised an average of 2.5 hours a week had a lower risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than their sedentary peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who exercised up to 2.5 hours longer than the average gained even more health benefits. But even working out for an hour and 15 minutes — half the recommended time of 2.5 hours — lowered the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, compared with no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8" data-toc-id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong doesn't believe in taking stacks of buzzy supplements, but said they can be useful for people with certain deficiencies or health conditions.

            &lt;p&gt;To keep his mind sharp, for an hour or two each day, Hong makes sure he does something that challenges his brain. "Your brain's like a muscle — if you don't use it, you lose it" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, work will be enough stimulation for him, but on the weekends, for example, he might play a game of chess or checkers with his kids, or read. Screentime doesn't count, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental stimulation can't prevent the brain from aging, but evidence suggests it can help build resilience against &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's disease symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as forgetfulness. This resilience is known as cognitive reserve, and studies have found that people with larger reserves, which are built through cognitive activity, developed Alzheimer's disease later in life and had fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important thing I tell all my patients is age is really a number," Hong said. "Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old. And it can also be the other way around."&lt;/p&gt;

Some studies have previously suggested anthocyanins can help combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study from researchers at the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-kent"&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;, has said the most effective way to use cherries to boost anthocyanins is not to juice them, but instead to turn them into a powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cherries that otherwise would have been discarded, researchers analysed cherry juice, pulp and pomace’s retention of anthocyanin. They found “greater biological activity” in developing the powder, which they suggested may bring more health benefits than extracts or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gofEvQ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18800"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/people/2081/ezcurra-marina"&gt;Dr Marina Ezcurra&lt;/a&gt;, the project’s lead researcher based in Kent’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/school-of-natural-sciences"&gt;School of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, said: ‘Working with local growers has been key to this success.

Flavonoids are understood to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that can boost your chances against dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONzcyWk5BX0hXS2xrT3RiRDE0aFlDNURSZGRmQVhXT05seHVraC11WTF6TjJ0STJhUWNVZldZQmlzMGFFZDdEbG9KRXVsTjBsM0hjYmY3bU1FUlN2aFdVb0pvVXpRanVpQ24wVHFLQjNlUUVXY3BJYmcxN2NJSlg2d2xCd3pPazllNlZqSnl1OFNXY2ZmckJ5dFFlQjVTQ0RtWjhPR2RJUlFvdlZzd1V1ZA</guid></item><item><title>父亲希望能治愈影响其他300人的儿子罕见病--英国广播公司</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5URHQxcXZxdHlZTG9waWhxeUhxV091Zy1RT2plYWxNQm1xb3BnNm1VWXFOa1hoaXBUTGhta1B6Sm1zLXpYcUZRaXk5cjAyRFV5X0RFVkJ3ZHlCQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBmYXVjQzctN0N3cjVlaXRJWXYyNENJVXhoZ2NLci1MWDVnZW85RjREX3lrc3p1dTA0NlNKTnlHeTcydmdhNlktclBjSWFhZ0c0Sm9EWUtIWUpxZjR6bnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Dad's hope to find cure for son's rare condition&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 bwIYVa"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;James McCarthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, West of England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Clara Bullock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Somerset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Supplied by family Tom is holding is son Jenson in his arms, their faces are touching and they are both smiling at the camera." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Supplied by family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Tom hopes a cure or life-changing therapies can be found for his son Jenson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A father whose son has been diagnosed with a condition only 300 people have in the world has launched a mission to find a "cure or life-changing therapy". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Within days of Jenson's birth he collapsed and was not expected to live.

In 2017, around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7310804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;462 million people&lt;/a&gt;, or 6.28% of the world’s population lived with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2024, the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="World Health Organization" rationale="Highly respected international organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-11-2024-urgent-action-needed-as-global-diabetes-cases-increase-four-fold-over-past-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; reported that the number of people living with diabetes worldwide had risen to more than 800 million, of whom 95% had type 2 diabetes. And the condition can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, vision problems and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and overweight are common in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and losing weight can help manage symptoms, or even &lt;a href="https://bmjgroup.com/losing-weight-can-reverse-type-2-diabetes-but-is-rarely-achieved-or-recorded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reverse the condition&lt;/a&gt; in some. Now, a study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#faq" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;turmeric or curcumin&lt;/a&gt; supplements might help people with these conditions on their weight-loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review of 20 randomized controlled trials, published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-025-00386-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, found that turmeric or curcumin — the active component of turmeric — had a beneficial effect on some indicators of obesity, and might therefore help with weight management in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M.

From a scientific standpoint, these changes, about 2 kg (5 lbs) of weight loss and [approximately] 2–3 cm (about an inch) off the waist, may seem small, but in population health even minor improvements in central obesity can reduce metabolic and cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric has long been used to add flavor and color to foods, and can also be taken as a supplement. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it may have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and that it is generally &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#adverse-effects" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;safe and well tolerated&lt;/a&gt; at the dosages found in food, although may have some side effects at higher dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest review investigated the effects of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on measures of body size, including body weight, &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and hip circumference, in 20 different studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All were randomized controlled trials comparing supplementation with placebo, carried out in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the studies were given dosages ranging from 80 milligrams per day (mg/day) to 2,100 mg/day, for 8– 36 weeks. The researchers noted that adverse events, such as stomachache, itching, vertigo, constipation, hot flashes, and nausea, were reported in only 3 of the 20 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to improvements in body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and hip circumference, but not BMI or waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those with prediabetes, supplements significantly reduced body weight and waist circumference, but again had no effect on BMI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found significant associations between dosage and waist circumference, and between duration of supplementation and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the study authors, &lt;a href="https://cv.tums.ac.ir/en/cv/Leila_Azadbakht" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Leila Azadbakht&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor of nutritional Sciences, and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammadreza-Baniasadi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mohammadreza Moradi Baniasadi&lt;/a&gt;, MSc in the Department of Community Nutrition at the School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, both at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, commented on their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that “the most useful finding is the dose-response relationship: Supplementation for [more than] 22 weeks significantly reduced body weight —[weighted mean difference of] -2.5 kg — and doses [of more than] 15,00 mg/day lowered waist circumference — [weighted mean difference of] -1.8 cm — in [type 2 diabetes] patients.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides practical guidance for clinicians on optimal dosing and duration to achieve meaningful effects, highlighting the potential of turmeric/curcumin as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions for weight control in diabetes management,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pure.atu.ie/en/persons/eamon-laird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eamon Laird&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, assistant lecturer in Human Nutrition at Atlantic Technological University Sligo, and adjunct assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, not involved in the study explained for &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turmeric/curcumin could influence metabolism, reducing inflammation, and potentially impacting (reducing) appetite. Some studies suggest curcumin can enhance thermogenesis (calorie burning for heat production), which could contribute to weight loss over time. Additionally, curcumin’s anti-inflammatory properties may help counteract some of the inflammation (cytokines) associated with obesity and diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-turmeric-help-you-lose-weight#research" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that turmeric may help with weight loss, but there is little clear evidence as to how it has its effects, as Azadbakht and Baniasadi told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While the precise mechanism remains somewhat enigmatic, we believe the activation of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;AMPK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; and the anti-inflammatory properties are the most likely primary modes, as they directly link to improved insulin sensitivity, reduced chronic inflammation — common in [type 2 diabetes] and prediabetes‚ and enhanced fat metabolism,” the study authors explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laird welcomed the study as interesting but highlighted “significant limitations to consider before getting too excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firstly,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT,&lt;/em&gt; “out of the 20 studies in the analysis 13 are from the same country (Iran). This limits the potential effects/applicability to the general public as there could be just something unique about that population whether it be genetics or just other dietary or other components not controlled for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there was a wide range of doses and forms of the product used, wide variations in the study duration whilst the majority of the studies were in mostly older female adults,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azadbakht and Baniasadi outlined how they hope to address these issues, noting: “We are considering further research to address limitations in the current evidence base. This includes larger, longer-term [&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280574" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt;] focusing on high-absorption formulations and combinations with lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to explore effects in diverse populations (e.g. varying ethnicities or comorbidities) and investigate mechanistic pathways more deeply […] to better predict responders and optimize safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is encouraging, but we need to be cautious. The overall effect sizes are small, and the certainty of evidence is low to moderate, meaning stronger, larger trials are still needed. […] For patients, the takeaway is that turmeric can be a helpful addition to a healthy lifestyle, but it’s not a shortcut to weight loss. Clinicians should frame it as a ‘supportive therapy’ alongside established treatments, like lifestyle and medications, for diabetes and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M.

			&lt;p&gt;From warming winter teas to zesty stir-fries, ginger (&lt;em&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/em&gt;) has long been a kitchen staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond its culinary charm, this spicy root has a rich history in traditional medicine – and modern science is catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies now show that ginger may offer a wide range of health benefits, from easing nausea and relieving colds to reducing inflammation and supporting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-common-spices-could-be-interfering-with-your-medication"&gt;These 3 Common Spices Could Be Interfering With Your Medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Nausea relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;Multiple clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown consistent evidence that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, particularly when compared to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/feeling-sick-nausea/"&gt;NHS even recommends&lt;/a&gt; ginger-containing foods or teas for easing nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger seems especially effective for nausea during pregnancy. In small doses, it's considered a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131535/"&gt;safe and effective option&lt;/a&gt; for people who don't respond well to standard anti-nausea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also promising evidence that ginger can help with chemotherapy-induced nausea, though &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;results are mixed&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to motion sickness and post-surgery nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger's anti-nausea effects may work by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;blocking serotonin receptors&lt;/a&gt; and acting on both the gut and brain. It may also help by reducing gas and bloating in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is rich in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, such as gingerol and shogaol, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests ginger supplements may help regulate inflammation, especially in autoimmune conditions. &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/172011"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that ginger reduced the activity of neutrophils – white blood cells that often become overactive in diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6874304/"&gt;extracellular traps&lt;/a&gt; (NETs), which are web-like structures used to trap and kill pathogens. But when NETs form excessively, they can fuel autoimmune diseases. In the study, taking ginger daily for one week significantly reduced NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study used ginger supplements, it's unclear whether fresh ginger or tea has the same effect. Still, the findings suggest ginger may be a helpful, natural option for people with certain autoimmune conditions – though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger also has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2019.1573829#:%7E:text=Results%20indicate%20that%20ginger%20contains,interesting%20alternative%20to%20synthetic%20antimicrobials."&gt;antimicrobial properties&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can help combat bacteria,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other harmful microbes. Combined with its anti-inflammatory effects, this makes ginger a popular remedy for easing cold and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; symptoms like sore throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Pain management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pain, the research on ginger is encouraging – though not conclusive. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3665023/#ref10"&gt;Some studies show&lt;/a&gt; that ginger extract can reduce knee pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis, especially during the early stages of treatment. However, results vary, and not everyone experiences the same level of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For muscle pain, &lt;a href="https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(09)00915-8/fulltext"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that taking two grams of ginger daily for 11 days reduced soreness after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger may also ease menstrual pain. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455918302304"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its effectiveness rivals that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger works by &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;activating pathways&lt;/a&gt; in the nervous system that dampen pain signals. It may also inhibit inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Heart health and diabetes support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, high blood sugar and elevated "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL cholesterol) are all risk factors for heart disease. Ginger may help with all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165525/"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; of 26  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ginger supplementation can significantly improve cholesterol levels — lowering triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, while raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. It may also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972845/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, ginger could offer additional benefits. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5692962"&gt;review of ten studies&lt;/a&gt; found that taking one to three grams of ginger daily for four to 12 weeks helped improve both cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits appear to come from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519348/#:%7E:text=Abstract,also%20discussed%20in%20this%20update."&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, including improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake in cells, and reduced oxidative stress. Ginger's anti-inflammatory actions may also contribute to its heart-protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809190/"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-sex"&gt;benefits for sexual health&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence in humans is still limited. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316093/"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ginger can boost testosterone levels, improve blood flow, and enhance sexual behaviour. In traditional medicine systems, it has long been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377061/"&gt;used as an aphrodisiac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's not yet strong clinical evidence to confirm a direct impact on libido, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12007927/"&gt;ginger's anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, circulatory and hormonal effects could play a supportive role, particularly for people managing conditions like diabetes or oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Brain health and cancer research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8971783/"&gt;neuroprotective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt; benefits. Lab-based studies show that ginger compounds can help protect brain cells from oxidative damage – a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other in-vitro research has found that ginger can slow the growth of some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells. However, these findings are still in early stages and more research is needed to confirm their relevance in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is generally safe when consumed in food or tea. But like any supplement, it should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170653" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg" alt="ginger tea" class="wp-image-170653 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ginger is safe to drink in moderation as a tea. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEmDGoaNQg/"&gt;Bigc Studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doses above &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;four grams a day&lt;/a&gt; may cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as heartburn, bloating, diarrhoea or mouth irritation. These are usually mild and temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;Certain groups&lt;/a&gt; should use caution with high doses. Ginger may increase bleeding risk in people on blood thinners (like warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel), and it can enhance the effects of diabetes or blood pressure medications, potentially leading to low blood sugar or blood pressure. Pregnant women should also consult a doctor before using high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ginger isn't just a fragrant kitchen spice – it's a natural remedy with growing scientific support. For most people, enjoying ginger in food or tea is a safe and effective way to tap into its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering taking supplements, it's always best to speak with your doctor or pharmacist first, especially if you're managing a medical condition or taking medication.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261506/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors soon discovered they were infected with the rare soil bacterium, which causes a disease called melioidosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous infection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose and tricky to treat, as it is naturally resistant to some antibiotics. It can infect people if they breathe it in or get it into open cuts. Sometimes the infection can stay localized, like a lung infection or a skin ulcer. But it can also get into the blood and become a systemic infection, spreading to various organs, including the brain. Fatality rates can be as high as 90 percent in people who are not treated but fall to less than 40 percent in people who receive prompt, proper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men in 2024 were quickly hospitalized and diagnosed with sepsis. Both were treated with heavy antibiotic regimens and recovered, though patient 2 relapsed in November, requiring another hospital stay. He ultimately recovered again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, about a dozen melioidosis cases are identified each year in the US on average, but most occur in people who have traveled to areas known to harbor the bacterium. Neither of the men infected last year had recently traveled to any such places. So the researchers turned to genetic sequencing, which revealed the link to two cases in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases, both men died from the infection. The man dubbed Patient 3 died in October of 1989. He was a veteran who fought in Vietnam—where the bacterium is endemic—two decades prior to his infection. The researchers note that such a long latency period for a &lt;em&gt;B. pseudomallei&lt;/em&gt; infection is not entirely out of the question, but it would be rare to have such a large gap between an exposure and an infection. More suspiciously, the researchers note that in the month prior to Patient 3's death, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Georgia as a Category 4 storm, dumping three to five inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

Her grandmother died of complications from RA, and in the last few months of her life, it was Smith who served as her caregiver, administering doses of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:methotrexate;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt; to treat her pain and inflammation. The drug, a form of chemotherapy also used to treat cancer, is so potent that Smith had to wear gloves to safely give it to her grandmother. So, when Smith’s doctor told her she too would probably have to take methotrexate long-term, her heart sank. “That was so scary for me,” she tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith’s RA and weight — 311 pounds — were “double negatives” against her health, her doctor said. She &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to lose the weight. And so Smith started following the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5 or 6 pounds in the process. But that wasn’t nearly enough to alleviate the excessive inflammation and pain in her joints during flare-ups, which could last as long as four months. Smith was in constant pain. Some days, she couldn’t go to work. Other times, she was physically incapable of playing with her 4-year-old daughter. “It was stress on top of stress, and those are some of the main triggers of a flare,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GLP-1 weight loss medications haven’t been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. But they’ve &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4823510/#:~:text=It%20was%20reported%20that%20GLP,on%20its%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20actions." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While Smith’s insurance wouldn’t cover the medication (deeming it for “cosmetic weight loss”), she got a prescription for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/millions-of-people-are-taking-compounded-weight-loss-drugs-now-theyre-about-to-disappear-202621562.html" data-ylk="slk:compounded semaglutide;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;compounded semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; from a local provider and, later, compounded tirzepatide from an online provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven months later, Smith, 30, hasn’t had a single arthritis flare-up. “I’ve been able to come off my rheumatoid arthritis medicines — and these are medications that people &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;come off of,” she says. It’s the biggest way that Smith’s life has changed since starting a GLP-1, but far from the only shift. For this installment of the Yahoo series &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tagged/on-my-weigh/" data-ylk="slk:On My Weigh;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On My Weigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Smith explains in her own words how the medication has helped her teach her daughter healthy eating habits and given her the clarity she needed to leave the teaching job that had burned her out. “Since being on a GLP-1, I put myself and my mental and physical health first,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Smith has lost nearly 70 pounds since starting tirzepatide.

My inflammation levels are down, I’m happier and I haven’t had a single arthritis flare-up since I’ve been on tirzepatide. I’m full of energy, I’m back to loving going out and dressing up — I just see myself. I’ve lost 69 pounds in seven months, and the other day I was able to put a towel all the way around me to cover up. I don’t think I’d been able to do that since high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food noise volume: &lt;/strong&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, my food noise was an 8 out of 10. Until recently, I was a full-time schoolteacher, plus I’m a full-time mom and girlfriend to a full-time musician. Staying busy kept my food noise at bay. But when I did want to eat, I wanted to eat the wrong way. Now that I’m on a GLP-1, I can’t say my food noise is completely gone. But it’s at about a 3, and when I do have cravings, it’s for taco salad, or soup or broccoli. It’s very weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="day-in-the-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="rise-and-shine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and shine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to my GLP-1 journey, I woke up in pain every morning. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could physically get up and move out of bed. I was so angry at my body. I felt like I was too young to be waking up in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I just jump up. I wake up at 5:15 a.m., go to the bathroom and jump on the scale. Then I tell my social media followers, “Good morning, this is going to be a good day.” I get my daughter up at about 6:30 a.m. I’m happy, and I go into her room refreshed because I’ve gotten a good night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="first-bites"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I used to have a bacon, egg and cheese croissant, hash browns and a large iced coffee from Burger King or McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I might get similar things when I eat breakfast out, but I no longer get full combo meals. I don’t drink coffee or sodas. I just have hydration packets in my water that I bring from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, I make eggs with some kind of meat or protein. Sometimes I’ll still have a croissant, but I purchase them from Sam’s Club now. They have fewer calories and 16 grams of protein. Even though I’m not always cooking, what I’m eating is better-quality food. And I make sure I’m always getting protein with breakfast. I’m setting myself up for success with that first bite, rather than eating those potatoes and iced coffee that are going to have me crashing by 12 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="get-ready-with-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before, everything I wore was very dark. We all know that black covers up everything. I would just throw on some sweatpants or joggers and just go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I actually care what I look like. I wake up earlier, because I want to have time to choose colors that I feel good and comfortable in. I like to wear a lot of different patterns. Prior to my major weight gain, I used to be a girl who loved heels. I’m slowly getting back into heels and jewelry, because I feel beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="make-a-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For about four years, before I started my GLP-1 journey, I had a gym membership that I never used. Now I know that gym life just isn’t for me. I’ll go every now and again, but it’s not a long-term solution because it’s not something that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But now I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in a season where I want to do things that I enjoy &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are good for me. Since starting my GLP-1, I’ve canceled my gym membership. Instead, I’ve been trying to incorporate things that I can maintain into my day-to-day routine — things like taking daily walks with my daughter and going to the park and playing with her. I have weights, a squat machine, a sit-up machine and a foldable elliptical all at home. When I feel like it, I go downstairs and work out. But I don’t want to put myself back in a position where I’m doing things just because people say I should. I want to be the captain of my own boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dose-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m actually on a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peptide-stacking-latest-viral-wellness-162349352.html" data-ylk="slk:whole peptide stack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;whole peptide stack&lt;/a&gt;, which is a set of several injections my doctor prescribed to help optimize my health.

Wednesday, I take the NAD+, Friday, I take NAD+ and Lipo-C. I feel like I have a really good stack, and it is prescribed by a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor. I think it helps me to feel like the best version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I consider Sunday nights my cheat night. I’ll eat something more fatty than usual, like a taco salad (but I’ll actually eat the shell), or I’ll have Olive Garden cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. I try to give my body something to eat the night before I take my medications. My cravings are stronger right before my shot days. But I’ve been able to train myself to be disciplined while having grace for myself and understand that it’s OK to eat things that you enjoy. Plus, now I crave things that I love &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is more active — and wearing bright colors — since starting a GLP-1. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty, courtesy of Cassandra Smith)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-do-lunch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s do lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My pre-GLP-1 lunch was a burger, some fried chicken nuggets, hot wings — anything fried, that was quick to grab-and-go or pick up from the drive-through. Cooking was just never my concern back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I actually take the time to cook instead, because I’ve realized that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A typical lunch these days is whatever I didn’t eat the night before for dinner. We all know that those of us on GLP-1s don’t eat as much and we always have leftovers. So, I’ve learned to love them. I never used to eat them, because I was going to fast food restaurants a lot — and who wants to eat McDonald’s the next day? Every now and then I’ll splurge and get some sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="happy-hour"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, I didn’t really feel like I had free time. I spent a lot of it sleeping. I felt mentally drained from dealing with kids all day (much as I love them) and crashing from what I ate. I would get home and just sleep. I called it hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I feel like I have more time — and did even before I quit my job. I enjoy going to Ulta and looking at new skin care, or going window-shopping at TJ Maxx. I know I’m still transitioning sizes, so I restrain myself from buying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any time spent with my child is quality time for me. But now it’s actually quality time for &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn’t have to just sit in bed and watch TV because that’s all I physically can do. We’re going to the park, we go on nature walks, we go to my parents’ house in the middle of the week because I have the energy to drive there, instead of being too drained because I ate potatoes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quantity of time with her hasn’t changed, but the quality of it has changed drastically. It’s more intentional, and she gains more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dinner-bell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I never had enough time in the day to really focus on what to eat before my GLP-1 journey. It was just, &lt;em&gt;Throw it in the microwave, throw it in the oven. &lt;/em&gt;When I went out for dinner,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I used to love to get steak. But when I found out that I had rheumatoid arthritis, steak would cause me to flare. So I stopped eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, my go-to protein is salmon, with a veggie, and they’re both cooked in my house. As soon as I began taking tirzepatide, I started to make sure protein was in every single thing I was eating. That first month or so, I tracked everything. But I learned how much protein and how many calories were in the things I was eating — as people on GLP-1s, we eat the same things over and over — and it just became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My doctor taught me to stay on the outside aisles of the store when I go to the grocery store. As long as you stay on those walls, you’re eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats and fresh eggs. If you’re buying food from the center of the store, the more sodium and calories you’re getting in those processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a 4-year-old daughter, it’s so exciting for me to be able to raise her in a way that I wish I had been raised. Cooking is a whole activity for us, and for her, cooking healthy food will be normal. I get to create that generational knowledge with my daughter and save her from having to be on a GLP-1 later, because she has had the opportunity to learn to eat the right things from the beginning. She asks if we’re having salmon and broccoli for dinner. Today, my sister picked my daughter and my nephew up and they went to McDonald’s. My daughter didn’t want anything. She understands, at 4 years old, that we don’t eat that. My mom makes treats for major events, and sometimes she’ll eat some of the extras. My daughter will be like, “Grandma, you shouldn’t eat that!” My mom says, “Get this little girl, she’s doing too much!” But I love it. I know that, even when I’m not present, the things I taught her still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-get-the-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get the bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before I started taking tirzepatide, I was spending a lot of money eating out every day with my daughter. At Chick-fil-A, we were spending $25 on one meal. It added up to about $800 a month. And on top of that was the junk I was buying at the grocery store to stock up the house. It probably totaled about $1,200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, Shed, my provider, has really good prices for GLP-1s. I spend about $300 a month on my medications. Ultimately, I’m saving money. My budget is better, and I’m able to invest more and help the people around me more because I’m not going out every day spending money on food. The bill is amazing. I love the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:27:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQM0dDWnh2MFM0aEdxVG1ua3dNa1JfWldLd2lkcWh1SEVQeUdQNVY3cjBjS1YwLWwtT3EtQ2UyNERrZFczcVZ5TTlRQ1dibWhtQjZfcjNoQ3NiVG5nazZqMVk1U1FqVTRpczBUaHVhUVhiSkswTUh1LWVqZHJQS2gxQUxvTjJ6ekVtNk9MTkpVbVhmMmJPUFpqNnNvOTE5TklMSGFqdC1mNndLNzVuSzNFNWVYb1pyTVNxT0dwbTVOVWRjRFlvc3M4ZmdpMnh3UQ</guid></item><item><title>如何在不用药物的情况下降低血压- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQemc0REZ5R0dSRFdzMktHRFd2NzdCa29zMlRNZEV3UU9RQnl2ZE9LZnZEQnJRbXpkcmZOOHROd21Rcm5SYTdBdUtHVE04ZjdNYzdkUzBhY0o1WGNVcms3YklNWS1SczI0UUpuZ25sbVZTLXY2b0VfVHVieC1odk1DVmN2QmYteldJVDhLRzFsd0dJV1RfTFdN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="video-resource__details--leaf"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/117060" target="_blank"&gt;recent pediatric COVID-19 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which differ from those of the CDC, have raised concerns from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who responded with an oblique warning to any physicians who might follow the AAP's advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AAP should ... be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC's official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act," Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1957914911415153107" target="_blank"&gt;posted this week on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1hkbqsd*_ga*OTExMTY4NzUwLjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjU1NDAzOTU5LjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;The AAP recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, released on Tuesday, included a strong endorsement of COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to under 2 years. The group also recommended COVID shots for older children if the parents want to do that. Those recommendations differ from &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/115822" target="_blank"&gt;guidance issued by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, which has said the vaccines are not specifically recommended for children although they can still get them if parents and providers agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Kennedy correct about the liability issue? "As has become common for Secretary Kennedy, this is misleading," Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dorit.reiss/posts/pfbid02WqwdHBfNN82WeFwBSFHrYKgGu8JVLH8wcpTzBnCkVGFiSUSs56ptqgHoVTAeismTl?rdid=GFdlkNAZtmmkImnu" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. "Whether a vaccine falls under VICP [the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the part of the Vaccine Injury Act that deals with liability issues] has nothing to do with whether AAP recommends it, and the liability protections are not removed by this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a vaccine is covered by VICP, liability protections apply to manufacturers and administrators: anyone claiming a vaccine harm from a childhood vaccine that is under VICP has to go through the program first," she said. "ACIP has not actually changed the current recommendations in ways that affect VICP." Furthermore, "COVID-19 vaccines for children are not under VICP, but that's not because of anything AAP did or the secretary, even, did  --  it's because Congress has not yet legislated to create an excise tax for COVID-19 vaccines, and until Congress does that, they're not within VICP."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Kirkland, PhD, JD, professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, agreed with Reiss that the COVID vaccine doesn't fall within the VICP and so is not affected by the CDC's new recommendation. However, "it could hint at future changes if Kennedy plans to withdraw recommendations from other childhood vaccines that are currently covered under the Vaccine Injury Act, which would mean that they no longer meet the statutory definition for coverage in the compensation program," she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This development should not change doctors' willingness to recommend pediatric vaccines, which still have all the safety and compensation protections that they had prior to Kennedy taking office," she added. "There do seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/washington-watch/116707" target="_blank"&gt;changes in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; on the way, though it's hard to know from Kennedy's remarks exactly what he has planned. Removing childhood vaccines from the compensation program could upend vaccine markets and leave the small number of people who suffer an adverse reaction without a plausible path to compensation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her Facebook post, Reiss reminded readers that "in spite of [his] implied threat, Secretary Kennedy would not be bringing any cases" to court related to vaccine injuries. Instead, "parents who think their children were harmed by COVID-19 vaccines are the relevant ones here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Kennedy did want to remove another vaccine from the VICP, she noted, "ACIP would have to completely not recommend it for children and pregnant women" instead of just saying it had to be administered after shared decision making between parents and providers. "And then," she added, "the secretary would have to open a rulemaking process  --  publish the change in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;, solicit comments, and publish a final decision. And a company making that vaccine, or someone denied a vaccine because of removal of liability protections, could sue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his tweet, Kennedy also called the AAP recommendations "corporate-friendly" and said that "The Trump administration believes in free speech and AAP has a right to make its case to the American people. But AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest, including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal  --  &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;  --  so that Americans may ask whether the AAP's recommendations reflect public health interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP's Big Pharma benefactors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP fired back. "This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts," AAP President Susan Kressly, MD, said in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;.​ "Our immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation's leading health experts. We are transparent about our funders​, follow rigorous conflict-of-interest disclosures, and maintain safeguards to ensure the integrity and independence of our guidance. We welcome an opportunity to sit down with the secretary to review our recommendations and restore our seat at the table."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last sentence in AAP's statement referred to some changes that Kennedy has made to vaccine policymaking at the CDC. In June, he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/115987" target="_blank"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  --  which advises the CDC on its immunization recommendations  --  and &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116026" target="_blank"&gt;replaced them with eight people&lt;/a&gt;, including known vaccine skeptics; some of the new members reportedly have their own conflicts of interest related to serving as expert witnesses in legal proceedings targeted at vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the AAP, the American Medical Association, and other healthcare groups &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116802" target="_blank"&gt;were told at the end of July&lt;/a&gt; that they could no longer participate in ACIP work groups, which convene in between ACIP meetings to develop recommendation options for ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;

However, now that he’s gone, Colleen has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight, and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was the youngest of five children,” Colleen said. “He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother’s shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren’t sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. Scott’s mother fought for her son’s right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School’s very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments according to Colleen. Scott helped write Idaho’s Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight,” said Colleen. “He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;

Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads but something that gave him much pleasure in life. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. “There are so many others who do a much better job,” he would say. “These are just silly little stories anyone could write.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, “Nobody would believe I really did those things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, Scott reluctantly “retired.” That’s when he began writing the “little stories” about his life that grew into two volumes of “Tales from the High Lonesome.” They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;

Author and Island Park News columnist Scott Hancock at a book signing in Island Park with his friend and fellow author EC Stilson of Pocatello. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Colleen has since published Volume 3, now available on Amazon, fulfilling the promise she made to her husband to publish it. She plans to combine Scott’s remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott’s books are available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/tales-high-lonesome-scott-hancock/dp/b08gdkghl2"&gt;Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler’s Market in Blackfoot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/06/keslers-gives-local-authors-a-place-to-sell-books/"&gt;RELATED: Kesler’s gives local authors a place to sell books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Colleen emphasizes that writing was just a small part of Scott’s accomplishments and who he was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people,” said Colleen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Colleen, sharing Scott’s legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you,” Colleen concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg" alt="Scott Hancock 1982 article" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-772270" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-860x575.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-748x500.jpg 748w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-600x401.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said Friday that an adult living in central Maryland has tested positive for West Nile virus, which is the first confirmed human case in the state so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is currently recovering from the infection. The health department did not confirm which county the person is residing, citing patient confidentiality issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is transmitted to humans through infected mosquitoes that have contracted the disease through birds. In rare cases, the virus can also be spread from person to person through organ donation, blood transfusion or from a pregnant woman to a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge people to be vigilant and take steps to avoid infection, such as eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes can breed,” Deputy Secretary for Public Health Services Dr. Meg Sullivan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 18 Maryland residents tested positive for West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80% of those infected with the disease do not develop symptoms, but some may experience mild symptoms, such as fever, headache and body aches, as well as skin rashes or swollen lymph lands. Symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus, which mainly affects the nervous system, is often more severe for those over 50 or those with previous health conditions once infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D.C. health officials also recently came across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/08/dc-health-urges-residents-to-take-precautions-after-several-birds-test-positive-for-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four dead American crows that tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus in Wards 2, 3, 5 and 7. D.C. Health recommended residents to take precautions by wearing long-sleeved clothing and wear EPA-approved mosquito repellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland health department urges people who are concerned about mosquito bites to cover up exposed skin and monitor their yards and gardens for high mosquito activity, especially areas with standing water that can attract the insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department launched a campaign in May to prevent mosquito bites, including a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yb0rvqfc0ue6fuidlwsg8/AOFoms-9xmKJ4S0GcqBgQ7g?rlkey=v2cvfm5v8oktn1jjxjpekxlkk&amp;amp;st=bghygnnw&amp;amp;dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social media tool kit&lt;/a&gt; to educate Marylanders on protecting themselves and their homes from mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although birds are not routinely tested for West Nile virus in Maryland, sick or injured birds can be reported to an appropriate local wildlife rehabilitator. Residents can call 877-463-6497 for a list of licensed rehabilitators or visit the &lt;a href="https://dnr.maryland.gov/Wildlife/Pages/plants_wildlife/wildlifeproblems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00023b6nbr204xax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen7glcz00073b6oiaq1zcwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000a3b6n5tc2dr48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000b3b6nutie338n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000c3b6n531u43t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00023b6nbr204xax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00053b6nug8ai2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00073b6nbd5esv9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00093b6nqlqmylw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen7glcz00073b6oiaq1zcwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000a3b6n5tc2dr48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000b3b6nutie338n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000c3b6n531u43t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKERSBURG, W.Va&lt;/strong&gt;. — Land owners across several counties of West Virginia’s Mid-Ohio Valley started to make grim discoveries in the past couple of weeks. Largely in the Parkersburg area people were finding large numbers of dead deer in small groups on their property. The carnage was also reported on the other side of the Ohio River to the Ohio Division of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia Division of Natural Resources wildlife disease specialist Ethan Barton confirmed the culprit was Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease or EHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thus far the disease is confirmed in deer in Ritchie County along with Wood, Jackson, and Pleasants County. We do have a few samples pending in a few other areas too. Across the river, the Ohio Division of Natural Resources has also confirmed cases just on the other side of the river in Washington, Athens, and Meigs County,” said Barton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is not uncommon and is spread by an infected midge. The tiny insect, often called a “noseeum” can quickly infect an entire herd of deer. However, the virus isn’t necessarily a death sentence for the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re very, very small biting flies and essentially it’s a bug virus which causes problems for ruminants of which the whitetail deer is the most susceptible to mortality,” explained Barton. “But some deer will survive infection. It’s a vector borne disease and a deer has to be bitten to contract it and there needs to be sufficient virus in the bite. There are a lot of variables and those who survive are going to be immune to future infection with that same virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of an outbreak can be disturbing. Multiple deer can be dead only yards apart making the damage look quite dramatic. Parkersburg Mayor Tom Joyce noted the city’s crews have removed nine dead deer from yards in the city this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reports started around the beginning of August when the regular rain the state had been experiencing in the spring and through much of the summer gave way to dry conditions. According to Barton, that’s the typical pattern which can lead to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typical conditions you would expect an HD outbreak would be a very wet spring and summer followed by an August that dries out,” said Barton. “If you’ve got a lot of midges then the stage is kind of set,.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the outbreak will be certain when the first frost arrives and kills all of the infected midges which had been spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in January and initially had links to the West Texas outbreak. The state confirmed 87 illnesses linked to the outbreak, 80% of them in children and 90% in people who were not vaccinated. Eight patients were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials thanked public health, medical, and lab workers who they said worked tirelessly through the outbreak, and they urged the public to keep their guard up against the measles, given multiple ongoing outbreaks in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wisconsin outbreak grows, Pennsylvania warns of exposures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Oconto County Public Health have &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/082225.htm"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; five more measles infections linked to nine earlier cases reported from Oconto County in early August, bringing the total to 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the ongoing investigation indicates that measles is spreading locally. Oconto County is located in northeastern Wisconsin and is part of the Green Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other measles developments, the Pennsylvania Department of Health yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/newsroom/doh-announces-confirmed-measles-case-in-out-of-state-individual"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an alert about potential measles exposures in four counties after an out-of-state traveler visited the state while contagious. The exposures occurred in Adams, Clearfield, Lancaster, and York counties. Locations included two Mennonite facilities, along with a travel center, a restaurant, and an entertainment venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that tolcapone increased activity in brain regions involved in inhibitory control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These changes were associated with improved performance on a self-control task and fewer drinks consumed during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder involves both strong motivation to consume alcohol and a reduced ability to inhibit that motivation. Brain circuits that support self-control are thought to be impaired in people with this condition. Specifically, lower dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex has been observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder, and this may contribute to the loss of behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to treat alcohol use disorder with dopamine-related medications have had mixed results, possibly because these drugs influence dopamine levels across broad brain regions. In contrast, tolcapone offers a more targeted approach. It inhibits an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase, which breaks down dopamine primarily in the prefrontal cortex. By increasing dopamine availability specifically in this region, tolcapone may help restore some of the self-regulatory functions that are disrupted in alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol use disorder is a prevalent and devastating disease for which only three medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said study author &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/trail-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Joseph P. Schacht&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These existing medications are believed to work by reducing craving for alcohol and/or changing its acute effects (increasing negative effects or reducing euphoric effects). A core symptom of alcohol use disorder is loss of control over drinking, and we wanted to explore whether a different kind of medication, which might increase behavioral control, might be effective for people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tolcapone, an FDA-approved medication for Parkinson’s disease. Tolcapone inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. This means that it can transiently increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine. We often think of dopamine as being related to reward and euphoria, but in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine is critical for many cognitive processes that involve behavioral control. We thought that, by increasing prefrontal dopamine, tolcapone might increase behavioral control among people with alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina. Participants were adults aged 21 to 40 who met diagnostic criteria for moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. They were required to drink at least 20 standard drinks per week and were not seeking treatment for their alcohol use. A total of 64 individuals with usable brain imaging data were included in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tolcapone or a placebo for eight days. Tolcapone dosage was gradually increased to a maximum of 200 mg three times per day. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after the medication period. The primary task used to measure self-control was the stop-signal task, which requires individuals to inhibit a dominant motor response when signaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tracked participants’ alcohol consumption using a daily self-report tool. To ensure the accuracy of the brain imaging results, several quality control measures were implemented, including controlling for motion during scanning and using different MRI scanner settings as covariates in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants who received tolcapone showed improvements in inhibitory control. This was measured by shorter stop-signal reaction times, indicating that they were better able to withhold a response when prompted. They also showed more behavioral adjustment after making errors, another indicator of improved self-regulation. These improvements were not seen in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to changes in behavior, tolcapone also increased activity in brain areas involved in self-control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These increases were only observed in the tolcapone group. Notably, individuals who showed greater increases in activation in these areas also tended to report less alcohol consumption during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We suspected that greater tolcapone-induced prefrontal cortex activation might be related to better performance on the task, but were pleasantly surprised to find that it was also related to less alcohol consumption,” Schacht told PsyPost. “This suggests that tolcapone’s effect on behavioral control in the brain scanner translated to changes in real-world behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found changes in how brain regions communicated with each other. Tolcapone increased connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and two other brain regions—the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex—that are also involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control. These enhanced connections were linked to better task performance and fewer drinks consumed, but again, only in participants who received tolcapone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that boosting dopamine levels specifically in the prefrontal cortex may help restore self-control in people with alcohol use disorder. This has been a longstanding goal in addiction research, but previous approaches have struggled to achieve this without unintended effects in other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that tolcapone can influence both brain activity and real-world drinking behavior, the findings suggest that targeted dopamine modulation could be a promising therapeutic approach. The inferior frontal gyrus, in particular, emerged as a central hub in the network supporting self-regulation, with its activity and connectivity predicting both task performance and drinking outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure activity in the prefrontal cortex while people engaged in a simple behavioral control task,” Schacht summarized. “We found that tolcapone, relative to placebo, increased activation of a brain region called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and that increased activation of this region was associated with better behavioral control (better performance on the task) and less alcohol consumption during the time people were taking the medication. This suggests that medications like tolcapone that affect prefrontal dopamine might be a novel strategy for treating alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the mechanism appears to be related to dopamine, the researchers caution that other neurotransmitter systems—such as norepinephrine and glutamate—could also be involved. Additional studies will be needed to disentangle these contributions and to examine whether the effects of tolcapone extend beyond self-control to other aspects of alcohol use disorder, such as craving or mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, some limitations should be noted. The sample size, while sufficient for the planned analyses, was relatively small. Larger trials will be needed to confirm these results and assess how long the benefits of tolcapone might last. The study also excluded people with psychiatric comorbidities or other substance use disorders, so the generalizability of the findings to more diverse clinical populations remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers were not able to test genetic differences in how participants responded to the drug. The study was designed to examine whether genetic variation in a dopamine-related gene (COMT rs4680) affected the drug’s impact, but the number of participants in each genetic subgroup was too small to draw firm conclusions. Prior studies suggest that people with certain genetic variants may respond more strongly to tolcapone, and this will be an important area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although it is approved for Parkinson’s disease, tolcapone has the potential for liver toxicity, which can be dangerous among people who may have alcohol-associated liver disease,” Schacht noted. “In this study, we used tolcapone under very controlled conditions (people had to have normal liver function to participate, and they took the medication for only 8 days). There are several approved COMT inhibitors that are not toxic to the liver, but they do not cross the blood-brain barrier like tolcapone does. We hope that COMT inhibitors that are brain-penetrant but not hepatotoxic will be developed in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to better understand whether the effects of tolcapone are specific to improving inhibition of alcohol-related impulses or whether they reflect a broader enhancement of executive function. Future studies could compare how the drug affects brain responses to alcohol cues versus non-alcohol-related tasks, or examine whether it changes patterns of decision-making or emotional regulation in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03904498" target="_blank"&gt;completing a large study&lt;/a&gt; in which we are testing tolcapone among people with alcohol use disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,” Schacht said. “This is a population for which improvements in behavioral control might be especially impactful. We hope to publish our findings within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More efficacious medications for alcohol use disorder are badly needed. This study was one small step towards a larger goal within the alcohol research community of identifying novel medications to help improve the treatment of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Effects of COMT suppression in a randomized trial on the neural correlates of inhibitory processing among people with Alcohol Use Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Drew E.

&lt;p&gt;MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland has struggled in recent years to keep bats from getting into the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit, prompting a complaint last year to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials said on Thursday they are currently addressing the “occasional incursions from bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite efforts to control bats at the Coulombe Family Tower, where the NICU and the critical care nursery are located, hospital officials confirmed there have been seven bat sightings this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees filed an OSHA complaint about the bats in June 2024 and since then the hospital has launched numerous measures to keep them from getting into the hospital. This includes replacing the facade at the Coulombe Family Tower, John Porter, MaineHealth spokesperson, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="exco-adslot" class="opscoad-exco-adslot" data-unit="/6119/pressherald.com/life/health"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSHA complaint has since been resolved, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OSHA accepted MaineHealth Maine Medical Center’s corrective action plan. No fine was issued, and required notices were posted,” Porter said in the statement. An OSHA official on Friday confirmed that the hospital addressed the complaint and the case is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Porter said “there have been no known bites of patients or staff” and that “every bat caught has been tested for rabies and they all have been negative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No patients or workers were tested for rabies, Porter said, because “there have been no instances where testing a person for rabies was advisable or necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last known human case of &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/news/maine-cdc-shares-tips-prevent-getting-rabies-bats-thu-07312025-1200"&gt;rabies in Maine was reported in 1937&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Ten captured bats tested positive statewide for rabies in 2024, according to the latest statistics available from the Maine CDC. Tests of the bats captured at Maine Med were conducted by Maine CDC labs, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A Maine Med nurse with direct knowledge of the situation told the Press Herald that workers have complained about bats in the Coulombe Family Tower for years, but that hospital officials were slow to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee asked to remain anonymous over concerns she would be retaliated against by hospital management for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think they are working on resolving it now, after the OSHA complaint, but they were slow in starting to do anything about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, dated about a week after the complaint was filed, noted problems with bats going back to 2023. Bat incursions into the hospital accelerated in 2024 — with six sightings — and was likely related to bats getting in at the site of where building repairs were being done at the tower, according to the letter, obtained by the Press Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Press Herald shared a copy of the letter on Thursday with Porter, who said in the statement that “in addition to on-going pest-mitigation work by contractors, MaineHealth Maine Medical Center is currently undergoing a façade renovation project in the Coulombe Family Tower, which should also address bat incursions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee said MaineHealth should have notified the public about the bat problem, “especially since we are talking about newborn babies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_42839617" class="caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-intermediate wp-image-42839617" src="https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt data-full-size="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/print/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg" data-should-sell="no" data-lazy-src="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg?w=750"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-intermediate wp-image-42839617" src="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg?w=750" alt="" data-full-size="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/print/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg" data-should-sell="no"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scaffolding surrounds Maine Medical Center while repair work between the older, lower part of The Coulombe Family Tower and the newer two upper floors continues. The tower has been infiltrated by bats. (Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer) &lt;span class="credit"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter, explaining why the public wasn’t notified last year, said that MaineHealth “relies upon regulatory agencies,” including OSHA, to “determine what disclosures are required for its care team, patients and the public when an incident of this nature occurs. MaineHealth has complied fully with those requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, the hospital protected patients by temporarily closing a portion of the critical care nursery, which is a unit where babies need specialized care but are in a condition that is not as severe as babies in the neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other steps included sealing various areas to prevent bats from entering and pest control measures, including disinfecting and monitoring areas where bats could get in, such as heating and air conditioning ductwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter said the hospital responded in 2024 “by moving staff and patients and working with contractors to minimize intrusions by bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures to control bats are ongoing, Porter said, as the hospital “continues to take all necessary steps to mitigate the problem and protect patients and care team members in cooperation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat populations in the Northeast have rebounded in recent years, after bats learned to better avoid places where a fungus grew that was reducing their populations in the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

And while noting that she did not wish to call out those responsible, there is a lot that can be learned from the experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s so that we can learn.

&lt;li&gt;If your wraps are a little stiff, warm them for 15 to 20 seconds in the microwave to make them a bit more flexible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-got-a-mandoline-here-are-the-recipes-you-should-make-first-8715610" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;slice the cucumbers thin&lt;/a&gt; enough for easy rolling.

Choose a lower-sodium turkey to reduce the amount of excess sodium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7935678/is-cucumber-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cucumbers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/9-best-foods-to-help-you-stay-hydrated-11764621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;high water content&lt;/a&gt;, so they’re great for staying hydrated. Being well-hydrated is important for your entire body, from regulating body temperature to helping you stay focused. Cucumbers contain silica, a mineral that keeps your skin smooth and firm. &lt;/li&gt;

Calcium is a key nutrient for overall bone health, including bone development and maintaining healthy bones. Choose a reduced-fat cream cheese to lower the amount of saturated fat in the dish—too much saturated fat can lead to heart disease over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kyushu University have demonstrated that yogurt intake increases the diversity of gut microbiota and alters its composition. Furthermore, bathing in chloride hot springs after yogurt intake was found to improve defecation status more than yogurt alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that combining two &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lifestyle+interventions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lifestyle interventions&lt;/a&gt;—yogurt intake and hot spring bathing—may contribute to better health, highlighting their potential application for preventive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1609102" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy gut environment is vital for overall health, as it plays a key role in regulating digestion, immune responses, and even neurological function. Yogurt, which contains prebiotic microorganisms such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lactic+acid+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lactic acid bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and bifidobacteria, has been known to modulate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; and provide a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, researchers at Kyushu University focused on Japanese &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hot+springs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hot springs&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Onsen. "We have previously reported the beneficial effects of onsen bathing on the gut microbiota. However, little has been known about how the combination of diet and onsen bathing influences health," says Professor Shunsuke Managi of Kyushu University's Urban Institute, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, we collaborated with Beppu City here in Kyushu, a region well known for its onsen, to investigate the effects of onsen bathing after yogurt intake."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This study enrolled 47 healthy adult men and women who had not bathed in onsens within 14 days prior to the start of the trial. The participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;, a yogurt group, and a yogurt plus onsen group.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group received no intervention, while the yogurt group consumed 180 g of low-sugar yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus after dinner daily. In addition to this, the yogurt plus onsen group bathed in Beppu's chloride spring for more than 15 minutes at least once every two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the four-week intervention period, gut microbiota surveys were conducted using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stool+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stool samples&lt;/a&gt;, and a questionnaire on defecation status containing 14 items which included evaluating stool frequency, stool consistency, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the use of laxatives was administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant increase in gut microbiota diversity in the yogurt group, accompanied by changes in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, these microbial changes were not observed in either the control group or the yogurt plus onsen group. However, both the yogurt group and the yogurt plus onsen group demonstrated significant improvements in defecation status scores, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that yogurt intake may enhance gut microbial diversity, and that its combination with onsen bathing may exert an additive or synergistic effect to improve defecation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the sample size is small, our findings suggest that combining two accessible lifestyle interventions—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/yogurt/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; intake and onsen &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bathing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bathing&lt;/a&gt;—may offer enhanced health benefits, particularly by promoting gut microbiota diversity and improving defecation status in healthy adults," explains Managi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are especially relevant given the growing interest in non-pharmaceutical, lifestyle-based strategies for preventive health and wellness. Furthermore, this research may support the development of evidence-based wellness tourism, particularly in regions known for their onsen, by providing scientific validation for health-oriented travel and services."&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-3e5e8820-7f71-11f0-bca3-b723b3cc772e"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that year, there were 279 congenital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12722117/Rates-syphilis-babies-risen-decade-record-high-CDC-report.html"&gt;syphilis-related stillbirths&lt;/a&gt; and infant deaths. Of those, 252 were stillbirths, an increase of 6.3 percent since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the national congenital syphilis (CS) rate of 105.8 cases per 100,000 live births in 2023 represents a three percent increase from 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing, as well as not following up with treatment after testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13029481/America-std-crisis-syphilis-rates-highest-level.html"&gt;sexually transmitted disease&lt;/a&gt; (STD) screening or treatment also contribute to the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, New York recorded three deaths from CS, but it isn’t the only state with increasing rates of both syphilis and congenital syphilis. The nation’s top five syphilis hot spots include South Dakota, New Mexico, Mississippi, Arizona, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These also have the highest rates of CS per 100,000 live births, according to the most recent CDC data. New York was ranked 40th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third infant death marked the 21st case reported in New York counties this year, excluding New York City. There were 35 cases in New York City in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, New York state officials are calling for mandatory blood test screenings for pregnant mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr James McDonald said in a statement last week: ‘No baby should die from syphilis in New York State or anywhere in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Detecting syphilis early in pregnancy with a simple blood test is important to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment, so you have a healthy baby.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD that causes skin rashes and sores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis is passed from the pregnant mother to the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. There are an estimated 1.5million cases of congenital syphilis each year, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and CS are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. When left untreated, CS can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and afterbirth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a visualization through 2022 of CS cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharon Nachman, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York, told DailyMail.com: ‘The problem is the pregnant patients receiving prenatal care that don’t follow up or show for their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don’t know if you were tested and perhaps tested positive for syphilis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who aren’t screened is another concern.

And it's currently facing a worldwide shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman explained that benzathine penicillin is an older generic drug that is produced less: ‘No new companies want to make benzathine penicillin.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The production of the antibiotic generates unwanted secondary products, such as bacterial residue, which are classified as hazardous waste.

Infectious disease specialist Dr Carla Garcia Carreno of Children’s Health of Dallas, Texas, told DailyMail.com: ‘Over the years we have seen that the African American population is the most affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There may be some decreased access to contraceptive methods for that particular population.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are in American Indians, Alaska Natives, Black and Hispanic populations, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barriers like limited healthcare access, lack of preventative resources, limited insurance, and trouble reaching testing sites fuel the increase in cases among these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman stressed that pregnant moms aren't the only ones who should be STD screened. Their partners risk syphilis reinfection, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Remember testing pregnant women is only part of the battle.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There may be some decreased access to contraceptive methods for that particular population.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are in American Indians, Alaska Natives, Black and Hispanic populations, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barriers like limited healthcare access, lack of preventative resources, limited insurance, and trouble reaching testing sites fuel the increase in cases among these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman stressed that pregnant moms aren't the only ones who should be STD screened.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/em&gt;—Today, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released updated clinical guidance regarding vaccination during pregnancy against COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. The three guidance documents, all of which recommend maternal immunization, lay out the full body of current scientific evidence that underscores the safety and benefits of choosing to be vaccinated against these respiratory conditions during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is well documented that respiratory conditions can cause poor outcomes during pregnancy, with pregnant women facing both severe illness and threats to the health of their pregnancy. Thanks to vaccines, severe outcomes from respiratory infections are largely preventable,” said Steven J. Fleischman, MD, MBA, FACOG, president of ACOG. “ACOG’s updated respiratory guidance documents repeat what we have long known: that vaccines continue to be the best tool available for pregnant patients to protect themselves and their infants from these viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated recommendations in support of vaccination are consistent with ACOG’s previous recommendations and also reflect a large and growing body of research and data regarding the safety and benefits of maternal immunization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Practice Advisory &lt;a href="/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care"&gt;COVID-19 Vaccination Considerations for Obstetric–Gynecologic Care&lt;/a&gt; recommends that patients receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or “booster” at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period, or when lactating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance notes that data show that the COVID-19 vaccines are particularly effective at reducing morbidity from COVID-19 complications in pregnant patients and their infants as measured by emergency department or urgent care encounters. Data also support the benefit of vaccination in reducing pregnancy complications, such as severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and stillbirth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, vaccination during pregnancy provides passive immunity to the infant after birth, protecting them from COVID-19 in the first few months of life before they can be vaccinated. Maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy also results in significantly greater antibody persistence in infants when compared to infants whose mother experienced infection during pregnancy without vaccination. Infants continue to be hospitalized for COVID-19 at higher rates than all age groups except adults 75 years and older, but vaccination during pregnancy can help protect infants against requiring hospitalization: during the 2023–24 respiratory virus season, less than 5% of mothers whose infants were hospitalized for COVID-19 were vaccinated during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are generally localized and minor, and the rates of side effects are not higher in pregnant individuals. Data strongly show that COVID-19 vaccination is not associated with a negative effect on pregnancy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Looking closely at the full body of data clearly shows that the COVID-19 vaccines are not only completely safe for use during pregnancy but also protective both during pregnancy and after the infant is born,” said Mark Turrentine, MD, FACOG, one of the named authors of the practice advisory. “I know that my patients do all that they can to make decisions that will help them have a healthy baby, and choosing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is one decision that I encourage them all to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influenza&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new practice advisory &lt;a href="/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2025/08/influenza-in-pregnancy-prevention-and-treatment"&gt;Influenza in Pregnancy: Prevention and Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, ACOG continues to strongly recommend that all individuals who are or will be pregnant during influenza season receive an inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine as soon as it is available, during any trimester of pregnancy. This recommendation reflects the increased risks associated with influenza infection for both pregnant patients and their newborns. Specifically, ACOG recommends influenza vaccination before the start of the influenza season but encourages vaccination at any time during the influenza season to ensure protection as long as the virus is circulating in the community. The new guidance notes that the new live-attenuated, intranasally administered influenza vaccine, which has recently been approved for home self-administration after having been exclusively prescribed and administered in a medical setting or a pharmacy, is not approved for use in pregnant individuals, but that it could be used for postpartum patients, including those who are lactating, who are averse to needle-based vaccines, or who prefer intranasal vaccine administration. The guidance also includes recommendations related to treatment of influenza during pregnancy, including with antiviral medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Decades of data have informed ACOG’s long-standing recommendation in support of vaccination against the seasonal flu during pregnancy. Unfortunately, data show that in recent years, less than half of pregnant patients have chosen to receive the flu vaccine,” said Neil S. Silverman, MD, FACOG, one of the named authors of the practice advisory. “All patients should know that the increased risks of influenza to pregnant women and their newborns are real, and that getting vaccinated before delivery can help them and their babies be protected against influenza and stay healthier during and after their pregnancies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the updated practice advisory on &lt;a href="/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2023/09/maternal-respiratory-syncytial-virus-vaccination"&gt;RSV, Maternal Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, ACOG recommends that during RSV season patients receive the bivalent RSV PreF vaccine in order to protect their infants after birth. Specifically, patients should receive the vaccine when they are between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation; if they do not have a planned delivery within two weeks; if they did not receive the maternal RSV vaccine during a previous pregnancy; and if they are not planning to have their infant receive a monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab or clesrovimab. Patients should also understand that if they decline the maternal RSV vaccination, their infant needs a monoclonal antibody at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The RSV vaccine provides our pregnant patients with the ability to protect their infants against severe respiratory illness before they are even born,” said Brenna Hughes, MD, FACOG, one of the named authors of the RSV guidance. “The RSV vaccine is a powerful tool that allows us to keep infants healthier and prevent hospitalizations and even has the potential to save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the guidance documents note that all three maternal vaccines for respiratory conditions—COVID-19, influenza, and RSV—can be administered at the same time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“In the face of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, a strong, evidence-based recommendation in support of vaccination from a trusted clinician can go a long way toward encouraging our patients to protect themselves and their pregnancies,” said Sandra E. Brooks, MD, MBA, FACOG, chief executive officer of ACOG. “As respiratory illness season begins, it is crucial that my fellow health care professionals actively support and recommend COVID-19, flu, and RSV vaccines for pregnant patients.”&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj3e001i3b6j8iiulabp@published"&gt;I am married and I have a close friend that is single. The other night, my husband, my friend, and I were drinking at my house. I had enough to drink and I told my friend I was sleepy. She told me to go to sleep. She did not have to tell me twice, I got up and went to bed and left her with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;

I could hear noises, like moaning and heavy breathing on the other side of the wall. I just listened and did not move. I realized I was turned on by this. It stopped, and my husband walked into our room to check on me. He goes out again and I can hear the noises again. Before this, my sexual drive for my husband was out. But now every time we get together I’m aroused again. What he and my friend did was wrong and I am not sure how many times they have done this with me knocked out in the other room. But it has also made a difference in our sex life. I have not confronted him or my friend, who by the way I work with. I have thought about just calling him out and not saying anything to my friend because this would impact our relationship at work.&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds like you’d like to indulge more in the &lt;a href="https://www.victoriamilan.com/landers/cuckquaen-guide/"&gt;cuckquean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, which involves deriving sexual pleasure by watching (or hearing) your partner have sex with others. It can be a form of voyeurism and it’s a pretty common sexual fantasy. This practice can include encouraging your partner to pursue it actively, or it can be just one that you participate in alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj42001r3b6jyackk8bd@published"&gt;You can pursue &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-voyeurism#when-it-becomes-a-problem"&gt;voyeurism responsibly&lt;/a&gt; by watching porn and role-playing, but it crosses the line when someone has not consented to be involved. While it’s sexy to hear your husband doing someone else, how would the other woman feel if she didn’t know someone was listening in for their own sexual enjoyment?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj5400273b6jooi9cp8l@published"&gt;Before confronting your husband, think about what you’d like to address. Is it the fact that he cheated and slept with your friend? Do you want an explanation? Or is it that you know and would like him to continue this behavior (with consent from all parties) but with more structure and rules, for example, a rule stating he can’t sleep with your co-workers? Know what resolution you’re looking for—setting some boundaries will make it less likely he’ll run to your friend, which can prevent the very awkwardness you’re trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4t00203b6jehguuges@published"&gt;Last year, we moved into a new house with excellent water pressure. Like almost pressure washer pressure. And using the handheld showerhead, I’ve found that extremely hot, extremally focused water jets spraying on my testicles is one of the most intense pleasurable experiences of my life. It’s not orgasmic, per se, but it feels really, really good - the point I kind of zone out and lose track of time. I know this is bad for my water bill, but my question is more basic: How do I recreate this sensation in the bedroom? My wife and I are approaching 20 years of marriage, and while we have a good sex life, it’s not particularly adventuresome. Shower sex is likely not in the scenario. Any advice? Toys? I feel like finding a solution for this problem will be helping me not only have a more pleasurable experience, but will also be good for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

Or consider the &lt;a href="https://www.womanizer.com/us/womanizer-wave"&gt;Womanizer Wave showerhead&lt;/a&gt; which claims to reduce water use by 60 percent, though that won’t help you out in the actual bedroom but might get at some of that guilt about wasting water. Friend of the column Sonja Vitow suggests a Waterpik with the tonsil stone attachment. But I’d add a waterproof sheet or mattress protector if you decide to bring it into the bedroom. Or start experimenting with other sensations that your testes might find tantalizing that might not involve water but could include just about any other form of touch you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a problem. Sometimes, when I have an intense orgasm, I have what I can only describe as a brain disconnect after. There have been a couple times when I cannot talk. I will try, but all that comes out is gibberish. I have also had panic attacks. It doesn’t happen every time I have an intense orgasm, but when it does it’s pretty scary. Is this a normal reaction to intense orgasms, or is it something I should be worrying about?&lt;/p&gt;

If it were, it’d have been captured, commodified, and turned into a subgenre of porn already (the closest example to a reference in popular culture that comes to mind is when Missy Elliott said, “Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah” in “Work It”).&lt;/p&gt;

Reinert is a gynecologist in Los Angeles who I reached out to after reading a paper she co-wrote, “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454896?dopt=Abstract"&gt;‘Did You Climax or Are You Just Laughing at Me?’ Rare Phenomena Associated With Orgasm&lt;/a&gt;,” which ran in the Sexual Medicine Reviews journal in 2017 and documents instances of rare peri-orgasmic phenomena reported in medical literature and via colleagues. (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-reminds-us-that-reproduction-still-evades-our-control.html?via=recirc_recent"&gt;Reinert has also contributed to Slate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

Sex also raises a person’s heart rate and blood pressure, and can be a trigger for dangerous health events, so it’s important to make sure that weird symptoms are ‘just’ due to orgasm, and are not a sign of a stroke, heart attack, or brain aneurysm, for instance.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4p001y3b6jv7ulezh1@published"&gt;Regarding your panic attacks, which Reinert’s aforementioned paper documents, she said: “Among individuals with a history of panic disorder, it has been reported that many experience panic attacks after orgasm; as with this individual, they do not typically occur with every orgasm, only a small percentage of them. If symptoms are sufficiently bothersome, an affected individual could talk with their doctor about medication to decrease the frequency of panic attacks (but medication side effects might cause more trouble for one’s sex life than did the panic attacks).”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4w00223b6jqizcoa6p@published"&gt;The speech symptoms are more concerning. “They sound like what is called Broca’s aphasia, which can be a sign of a stroke in the part of the brain responsible for production of language,” Reinert wrote. “Since this individual’s symptoms occur only immediately after orgasm and then spontaneously resolve, it’s not likely a stroke, but could be due to a seizure or transient ischemic attack in this brain area. It has been reported that some people experience seizures precipitated by orgasm. I would recommend that this person discuss these symptoms with their doctor and maybe a neurologist, in order to rule out a potentially dangerous underlying medical condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirpbzn00323b6j3sim48qa@published"&gt;I have an ethical question I would be interested in your opinion on (though I have a hunch what your answer will be). The question is, with all the discourse concerning consent and power around sexuality and age taking place right now, is it OK to fantasize about underage people if those fantasies are memories in which you were &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/09/fantasy-age-difference-advice.html"&gt;also underage and an active and enthusiastic participant?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
