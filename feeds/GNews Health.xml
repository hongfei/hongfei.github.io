Ever since the mRNA Covid vaccines were approved in 2020, experts have looked at flu as one of the next logical applications for the technology. No country has approved an mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6964ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said Pfizer’s mRNA flu vaccine could be “a game-changer,” potentially providing a closer match to the strains in any given flu season. One big reason flu shots aren’t as effective as they can be is because they aren’t a good match for the circulating virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0637c4" class="body-graf"&gt;Because it takes months to manufacture a traditional flu shot, Creech said, scientists must choose the strains to include in the vaccine about six to eight months before flu season begins. Developing an mRNA shot is typically faster, which could allow those decisions to be made later in the year — and give scientists more flexibility to pivot if the circulating strain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc03ef" class="body-graf"&gt;“There remains a significant need for improved approaches to prevent influenza,” Creech said. The trial results, he said, provide “proof” that the mRNA shot has an advantage over traditional flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f551e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer, however, may face an uphill battle to get the new vaccine approved, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99fbbc" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085"&gt;downplayed the benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and has singled out vaccines made with mRNA as particularly dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312"&gt;calling the mRNA Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” Several states have introduced legislation to ban mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60c9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;In August, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding into mRNA vaccine research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df072e" class="body-graf"&gt;In May, Moderna, which also makes an mRNA Covid vaccine, withdrew its application seeking approval for its combination flu and Covid mRNA shot after the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;asked for more data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-188133" class="body-graf"&gt;“Despite all the advantages of mRNA, I’m concerned that our current DHHS has no or little interest in the science,” Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c806e" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1461e9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kelly Lindert, Pfizer’s vice president of clinical research and development, said in an email that the company is “in discussion with health authorities on the path to licensure of mRNA influenza vaccines.” She declined to comment on the timeline for submission or approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f57c82" class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial, funded by Pfizer, compared the company’s mRNA shot to Fluzone, one of the most widely used seasonal flu vaccines in the U.S. More than 18,000 adults, most of them in the U.S., were randomly assigned to get either shot during the 2022-2023 flu season. Other trial sites included South Africa and the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ace139" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial found Pfizer’s shot cut flu-like illnesses by 34.5% compared to Fluzone — 57 cases in the mRNA group versus 87 cases in the Fluzone group. Nearly all infections were caused by two common influenza A strains: H3N2 and H1N1. The Pfizer vaccine also protected against two influenza B strains, the Victoria strain and the Yamagata strain. The Yamagata strain fell out of circulation during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48917d" class="body-graf"&gt;Both flu shots caused side effects, including arm pain and fatigue, though they were more common in people who got the mRNA flu shot compared to the traditional vaccine. A small percentage — 5.6% — of people who got the mRNA vaccine reported fevers, compared to 1.7% in the traditional flu shot group. Most side effects were mild to moderate and went away within 1 to 2 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef7bb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said it’s not surprising that the mRNA vaccine caused more side effects, given that it generated a stronger immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-951429" class="body-graf"&gt;“In some ways, this is like training for a race,” Creech said. “We may have a little bit of muscle soreness or fatigue after a training run, but by having a little bit of discomfort then, we can avoid overwhelming fatigue or soreness during the race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f041f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Lindert said it’s plausible people are reporting more side effects due to “the cascade of events from the activation of the immune response.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccee36" class="body-graf"&gt;“The relationship between side effects and immune responses is the source of ongoing discussion in the scientific community,” Lindert said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb9a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Moderna is also still working on a stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1f0ca" class="body-graf"&gt;In June, the company reported results from a late-stage trial in older adults, finding its mRNA flu shot was about 27% more effective than an approved flu shot made by GSK. The company said people who got its shot had side effects that were similar to those seen with other flu vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed2dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said “not all mRNA vaccines are created the same,” adding that it’s not surprising Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots could have different efficacy levels and side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-577d84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Moderna said the company plans to file for approval for its stand-alone flu vaccine by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:02:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOelQ2N2tfX3ZkY1Y0RVdrWUx5WnZTQkRIRFdabkhuRjVLUHd5ZDI4TDd1RDYtSFFxTkFpZUlyTmYxMnJ2ZW0xOHhDaG1lV2xyb0FvTnRSd1NVN0k0THRZb3RPUWdQYzE4ZVVZUy15QUhzWTl3Ri0zX0xiNE1VWWVrZVZYZU9PeDJybGMxMG1HRzlrbXd6RVd6Z1puVXNMREZMZ25zQ0VCUWhUOWNJUjFmZm54UjRtbzZFajA4T1ZBbGdWQdIBVkFVX3lxTE1DeDFad1A1ZDBva1pEQXptZGVDZl9lZDVMZV9hV296ZE5TdV9nejhDMFJXakl1dF9sNDFPeU81VFZqajVuNUZFdk5lb2pMSFFreGYxZk53</guid></item><item><title>女性似乎比男性收回的论文更少—但为什么？ -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03796-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Woman taking notes in lab with lab equipment in the foreground and background." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Are women more careful about their research than men?

A new study finds that women’s names filled just 23% of author slots in a sample of nearly 900 retracted articles published in medical journals between 2008 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really interesting, creative and robust study,” says Curt Rice, who promotes publishing literacy at the Publishing Unlocked project in Oslo, Norway. “The article invites us to dig into issues like negotiations about authorship and the likelihood of scrutiny.” The findings were reported on 19 November in &lt;i&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00509-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_50653532.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;Study author Paul Sebo, an internal medicine specialist and researcher at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, used an artificial intelligence tool that infers whether authors are male or female based on their first names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found women’s names in 16.5% of first-author slots and 12.7% of last-author slots for the retracted papers. By contrast, an earlier study that used a similar tool for predicting author gender found that women accounted for 41–45% of first authors and 26–33% of last authors in all articles from the same selection of journals across the same time frame&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk and reward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the results is fraught. The gender-prediction tools used are imperfect. They do not capture non-binary identities, for example, and can be less accurate with non-Western names than Western ones. But in a manual check of 200 names, Sebo found no mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the findings themselves don’t come with a clear explanation. In an e-mail to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, Sebo wrote that his suspicion is that the disparity stems from how “women are still underrepresented in senior academic roles, lead fewer projects, and therefore may be less exposed to the kinds of responsibilities (and risks) that are more commonly associated with retractions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The case for removing fluoride from the drinking water supply just got weaker. Research out today shows no link between water fluoridation and declining cognition in children or adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the education and medical records of a large, nationally representative group of Americans. They found no evidence that water fluoridation was associated with lower test scores in high school or lower cognition scores later in life. The findings seem to undermine one of the most common arguments made against adding fluoride to people’s drinking water, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If fluoride lowers your IQ, then we should see lower test scores in places where they fluoridate the water. And we didn’t, at all,” lead author John Warren, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Minnesota’s Minnesota Population Center, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The fluoride bogeyman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among some groups, water fluoridation has long been blamed for a range of health problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longtime antiscience crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science/index.html"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that fluoride is causing widespread IQ loss and increased bone cancer, for instance. And since taking over as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the second Trump administration, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-will-tell-cdc-to-stop-recommending-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that he will tell the CDC to no longer recommend water fluoridation on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the most boisterous claims made about fluoride are unsubstantiated by the current data, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html"&gt;supposed cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there has been a more &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-does-the-evidence-say-about-fluoride-lowering-iq-2000548298"&gt;substantial scientific debate&lt;/a&gt; over whether water fluoridation can affect children’s IQ. A review published earlier this January and conducted by scientists at the National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a possible link between lower IQ levels in children and greater fluoride exposure, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Study researcher John Warren notes, as others &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828430"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;, that this review largely focused on studies looking at much higher and potentially toxic levels of fluoride exposure than typically seen in the U.S., however. And in general, there’s only been limited research examining this possible link among American children.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It really struck me that there was a problem with that meta-analysis,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lack of harm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren and his colleagues believed they had access to data that could provide a clearer picture of the relationship between fluoride and cognition: the &lt;a href="https://edshareproject.org/data/hsb/about"&gt;High School and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; study. This project, initiated in the 1980s, collected reading, math, and vocabulary test scores from over 26,000 high school students across the country; a subset of surviving participants were also contacted as adults and asked to undergo medical evaluations, including tests of their cognition, up through age 60.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many people grow up in the towns and neighborhoods where they went to high school, especially in the 1980s. So the researchers cross-referenced other federal data on water fluoridation levels in the areas where the children went to school. This data was then used as a proxy for people’s exposure to fluoride as they were growing up. Though many parts of the U.S. had started regularly fluoridating their water by the early 1980s, plenty hadn’t or had adopted their own local standards, allowing the researchers to compare varying levels of fluoride exposure among neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, Warren’s team failed to find a negative association between relatively higher levels of fluoride in a town’s drinking water and high school children’s test scores; if anything, kids in the U.S. exposed to fluoridated water actually seemed to have slightly higher scores on average. This slight advantage faded by age 60, but the researchers still found no link between lower cognition in adults and fluoridated water exposure in childhood. They also found that few neighborhoods exceeded recommended fluoride levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If [fluoride] lowers your IQ, which is supposed to be a permanent change, then you would expect lower cognition at age 60. But we didn’t find that,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The future of fluoridation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren notes this study only looked at the relationship between cognition and fluoride, so it alone can’t tell us whether water fluoridation is a net positive. But he points out that other research has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm"&gt;affirmed&lt;/a&gt; its benefits in improving dental health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are also aware that children’s test scores are an imperfect indicator of IQ. But they’re now conducting a similar study of children in Wisconsin, where they do have access to IQ test scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is, these findings obviously undercut the rationale to remove fluoride from people’s drinking water. And while the researchers are planning to further study the topic, they argue it will take much stronger evidence than currently amassed to reasonably justify such a removal based on hypothetical concerns about IQ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we’re showing is that this IQ story—it doesn’t hold up in the United States in a representative sample at levels of fluoride that are actually relevant for policy discussion,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, reason is in short supply these days. Aside from RFK Jr.’s federal campaign, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-2nd-state-ban-fluoride-public-drinking-water/story?id=121852274#:~:text=MORE:%20Utah%20becomes%201st%20state,last%20month%20to%20ban%20fluoride.&amp;amp;text=Commissioner%20Roberto%20Gonzalez%2C%20who%20sponsored,Control%20and%20Prevention%20(CDC)."&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJUYFjnnNk"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; have already passed legislation this year to ban water fluoridation, and still more &lt;a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2025/04/22/ga-docs-defend-fluoride-water-critics-seek-removal/"&gt;states and towns&lt;/a&gt; may soon follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fluoride might not be lowering anyone’s IQ. But the fear of it sure seems to be doing a number on some people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 19:00:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPM0VNZm9JRUdvMEpORElKcDBHbERSY1lObW5WR0VqX0s0Tnl5NnYzMmxxRWowS1p0ZVZuMkVWNjkybXZMQU9fUU5yM2NYVzlnLUloNGtJbjNrSUpiYWxzT1l3VlN3eGRjb1NrUWpBOUtObUNXdzNHbzNWeFpxcFdUd1F3MmUzYTkxVkMyMXFwUkx2WUxnUU5PaVcyeU5LUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，饮用水中的氟化物不会对认知能力产生负面影响—实际上可能带来益处- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/fluoride-drinking-water-cognition-positive-link</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The longstanding public health practice of adding fluoride to community drinking water is facing heavy scrutiny in the United States over questions about whether the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/health/fluoride-drinking-water-tooth-decay-risk-benefit"&gt;benefits outweigh the potential risks&lt;/a&gt;. But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00043b6n3ku5s58k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The heightened federal debate was spurred by a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/children-higher-fluoride-levels-lower-iqs-government-study"&gt;recent government study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “&lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride" target="_blank"&gt;insufficient data&lt;/a&gt;” to determine the effects of lower levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00053b6nyo18qz6c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the&lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757" target="_blank"&gt; study published in the journal Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923" target="_blank"&gt;pledges&lt;/a&gt; to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/health/utah-fluoride-water-health"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; have become the first two states to ban the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000a3b6nx4z11dz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000b3b6n382fj10a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000c3b6ndjfrjd54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000d3b6nj330uxia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000e3b6nsoksqobb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000f3b6nf6ai9wmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6am3vi00003b6rapalhitu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000g3b6noot334sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6ami4r00013b6royh0ivam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the US Food and Drug Administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/fluoride-supplement-restrictions-fda"&gt;took action&lt;/a&gt; to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000h3b6ndmzr6c78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000i3b6niaguwh3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000j3b6nmt4unwfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in a &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aed4503" target="_blank"&gt;formal response&lt;/a&gt; to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000k3b6ndkl9lppx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000l3b6nhr53fqlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Hundreds of videos on social media celebrate the benefits of dietary fiber and share recipes to help viewers get more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s even a term for trying to meet or exceed the recommended daily fiber intake: fibermaxxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fiber’s benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html"&gt;muscle-building protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, fiber isn’t sexy. It’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-markers-biomarkers-3d19f93573cf36698c7b946fee6e8d18"&gt;a carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in plants that your body can’t break down. It helps feed gut bacteria and move food through the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Folks don’t want to talk about it at a dinner party,” said Debbie Petitpain, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material that feeds gut bacteria. It’s found in foods like oats, peas, beans, apples and carrots. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water and moves food through the digestive system. It’s found in whole wheat flour, popcorn, wheat bran, nuts, green beans and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that fiber lowers cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugar and promotes weight loss, since high-fiber foods tend to make eaters feel more full. It may also protect against heart disease, diabetes, diverticulitis and colon cancer, according to the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said rising use of GLP-1 weight loss drugs could be one reason for the renewed focus on fiber, since GLP-1s naturally slow digestion and fiber can prevent constipation. She said fiber has seen similar spikes in interest when people wanted to alleviate symptoms from high-fat diets like Atkins or keto.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How much fiber do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people in Western countries could use more fiber because their diets are low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, said Sander Kersten, director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s guidelines, adults should aim for 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they consume. That’s about 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. Petitpain said Americans generally only get about two-thirds of that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For reference, 1 cup of raspberries contains 8 grams of fiber, while a banana contains 3.2 grams, according to the USDA. One-half cup of avocado contains 5 grams of fiber and 1 cup of lima beans contains 13.2 grams. Fiber One, a bran cereal, packs 18 grams of fiber into a 2/3-cup serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/bsp-figure&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are good ways to increase fiber?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kersten said long-term studies about the benefits of fiber have looked at the consumption of whole foods and not &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;packaged products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with added fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way it is consumed as an additive and part of a diet that doesn’t contain a lot of fiber may be different than a naturally fiber-rich diet,” Kersten said. “You can eat a very processed, Western diet and consume foods that are enriched, but we don’t know if it confers the same benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods also help the body in other ways, Petitpain said. An apple contains 4.8 grams of fiber as well as water, vitamins and minerals, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some recommendations from the Mayo Clinic for adding fiber to your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose a breakfast cereal with 5 grams or more of fiber a serving. Top it with a sliced banana or berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose breads with at least 2 grams of fiber per serving and try other grains like brown rice, whole-wheat pasta and quinoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— When baking, substitute whole-grain flour for white flour. Add wheat bran to muffins and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Try to eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily. If you eat canned fruit, make sure it’s canned in fruit juice and not syrup, and make sure canned vegetables are low in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Think twice about fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no defined upper limit for fiber intake, Kersten said. But increasing fiber can cause painful gas and bloating, especially if it’s done quicky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said people should increase their fiber intake gradually and drink plenty of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re feeding gut bacteria a food, and you can’t break it down. You rely on them, and if you give them second, third and fourth servings, there’s not enough of them to handle the extra load,” Petitpain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations should also be extra careful about their fiber intake, Petitpain said. People who are sensitive to gluten or allergic to foods like soy, shellfish or psyllium husk should read labels carefully since some foods with added fiber contain those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Kersten questions the trend of focusing on one nutrient, whether it’s protein or fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need nutrients, we need foods. Ultimately, what you want to be striving for is a healthy diet, and you should choose foods that are considered to be an important part of a healthy diet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzmy00183b79jxunhd9p@published"&gt;I’m a 59-year-old gay man who had a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostatectomy/about/pac-20385198"&gt;prostatectomy&lt;/a&gt; last year. I often receive aggressive, in-person flirtation from nice guys who obviously want to hook up casually. I owe them a warning, though.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69usp6002p3b794seao9jb@published"&gt;I desperately want to say yes (with precautions), but when do I tell them that I won’t get hard? I’m a passionate guy who enjoys a lot of things, and can still have wild, dry orgasms. Rejecting a blowjob comes off as rejecting the person. Mentioning my prostate cancer is a mood killer for a casual flirtation, but guys take it personally if we make out and I don’t get hard (even though I’m totally into it). I have a BiMix prescription, but even then, it’s not very portable, and I have to excuse myself awkwardly. What explanation do I owe them, and when? If it’s a dealbreaker, I’m wasting their time. Nobody seems to understand the sad side effects of this surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzu1001a3b79p9v07hqw@published"&gt;—From Top to Bottom But Still Alive&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzz4001c3b79d1cvklos@published"&gt;I feel for you and agree—the effects of a prostatectomy are not discussed very often in mainstream forums. Especially lacking is how they impact gay sex. It sounds like you’re handling yours well, though. I don’t know for sure if your sign-off is a true reflection of how you’ve modified your sexual practices to your current abilities/interests, but if so: Bravo. You’re finding your way despite unfair limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o02j001d3b79au1uvheh@published"&gt;If you are identifying as a bottom, it is completely reasonable to say upfront to potential partners that your dick is off limits, especially in casual encounters. Plenty of bottoms don’t get hard and/or put no focus on their penises during sex. This may disappoint some vers/top guys, but it won’t turn them all off. The negative reactions you’ve received about your lack of erection won’t necessarily be the norm—you may just have encountered a less-than-ideal sample. You’re nearly 60 years old, and it’s not uncommon for guys to have erectile issues as they get older. You don’t have to explain yourself or talk about your surgery. They can take it or leave it. This may result in rejection, but so might identifying as a total top in the event that one encounters another total top. It’s OK to not be for everyone, as exciting as it is to be pursued on a mass scale. Let people take their disappointment and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o05u001e3b79p4vz3trx@published"&gt;So for hookups, I’d say you owe little to no explanation. You’re doing what you’re doing, it doesn’t involve your dick being hard, and that is that. If you were to embark on regular sex with someone, whether a sex bud or a boyfriend, that’s when you might want to say something. You’d want to do it sometime around when you notice things getting less anonymous. At that point, your partner will have already liked what you’ve offered so far, and hopefully, will be happy just keeping things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o0bx001f3b79rhxkev2t@published"&gt;Familiarity might make the BiMix injection process a bit less awkward, too. Regarding that medication, it’s worth trying to break down the awkwardness you feel about that. It’s not ideal, but look at how amazing medical technology is! If someone really wants to play with your hard dick, there is a good chance that he will be accepting of whatever method you use to achieve it. Having to use drugs to achieve and maintain an erection can be humbling, but if you try to focus on the practicality, it may make it easier. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69qjso001q3b79nw31snsd@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for almost 11 years and have been together for 15. I have tried to have many conversations about sex and they are hardly productive. I have tried many of the common suggestions for improving sexual frequency, having a set day/time for it, asking her what I can do to turn her on, etc. But every suggestion is brushed off, she wants our sex life to be spontaneous, or she just has to be in the right mood to do it, and while I respect her answers to these questions they don’t help me figure out what I can do to help. Over the past year, I know she has made an effort to increase frequency for me, and I GREATLY appreciate it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/wife-requests-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, there is a hitch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They’re &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-breakfasts-you-can-make-when-youre-still-half-asleep"&gt;quick to to cook&lt;/a&gt; and easy to eat. And each one packs about 6 grams of protein. But there are a lot of other high-protein snacks out there—both in the meat and veggie categories— that offer significantly more protein while being just as easy to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t just talking steaks or &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-meals-easy"&gt;lean chicken breasts&lt;/a&gt;, but a variety of plant and animal proteins that you can snack on or add to meals. Best of all, by broadening your protein intake away from eggs and meat alone, you’ll pack in a whole roster of other benefits for your gut, brain, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Icelandic dried fish to clever whole-food pairings, these non-eggy options will help you meet your fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat and fish options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gullfiskur Harfiskur (Icelandic Dried Fish)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With 80g protein per 100g, this is lean, briny, and pure,” says David Higgins, the author of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Body Plan,&lt;/em&gt; and co-founder of lifestyle performance club &lt;a data-offer-url="https://body-space.co.uk" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://body-space.co.uk"}' href="https://body-space.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bodyspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This traditional Icelandic snack is quite literally just dried white fish—no frills, no &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/carb-cycling-diet" target="_blank"&gt;carbs&lt;/a&gt;, and more protein than almost any food on the planet. “I first discovered it while working in Iceland and it’s now a non-negotiable travel snack,” says Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat it with a smear of hummus or a grain-based cracker for a smart balance of texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biltong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of biltong as jerky’s more sophisticated cousin. It’s air-dried, richly seasoned beef that’s protein-dense and packed with umami. “My go-to? The Biltong Factory. Their classic cut is clean, chewy, and easy to portion out,” says Higgins, who points to biltong’s whopping 50g of protein per 100g. “Add a handful of roasted chickpeas or lentil crackers for a complete amino chain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seitan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not gluten-intolerant, seitan is a real powerhouse with up to 25g of protein per 100g,” says physical trainer and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/about-me/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;. Often used as a meat alternative by &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-new-veganism"&gt;vegans&lt;/a&gt;, seitan is well known for its texture and it’s ability to absorb flavors, making it a decent addition to curries, stews, stir-frys and other dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These young soybeans pack a serious protein punch,” says Sas Parsad, nutritionist and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ"}' href="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Gut Co&lt;/a&gt;.

Measles is considered eliminated in a country or region only when there are no outbreaks lasting longer than a year. Thus, to maintain "elimination status," any introductions of the disease from travel must be quashed before 12 consecutive months of spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="75d9d247-d03b-4086-b8c8-a4f5e13dacf8-2"&gt;A large measles outbreak in West Texas began in January 2025 and has since ended — but while it was raging, it may have sparked cases in Arizona and Utah, where ongoing outbreaks are still occurring.

"But it's likely, as they look at the cases that started off in Texas and have continued to spread, that they will think there have been 12 months of cases coming from that area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles elimination is a cherished goal for public health. The disease, marked by a high fever and dramatic red rash, is miserable at baseline, but it can also have fatal complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. According to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who catch measles die in this acute phase of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For survivors, measles can have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term health consequences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including immune "amnesia" that leaves them prone to other illnesses. And about 7 to 11 survivors out of every 100,000 people infected face a fatal long-term complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a degenerative nervous system disease that arises years after the measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine reduce the chance of catching measles by 97%, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because measles is one of the world's most transmissible infectious diseases, however, eliminating it requires high levels of vaccination. In a population without immunity, one person with measles can infect between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 and 18 others&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To snuff out an outbreak, you must bring that number down to less than 1, meaning about 95% of the population needs to be protected via vaccination or immunity from a prior infection, Hijano told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLVNvvkdCVngUVVJVysGp" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLVNvvkdCVngUVVJVysGp slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 92.5% of kindergartners are up-to-date on their MMR vaccines, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data from 2024-2025 school year. This number is even lower in some areas and communities, such as the largely Mennonite community in West Texas. These clusters of low vaccination coverage not only represent people at risk of catching measles personally but also pose a challenge for public health responders trying to contain outbreaks, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/amy-k-winter/" target="_blank" data-url="https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/amy-k-winter/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a demographer and infectious-disease epidemiology researcher at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="0ec1f081-67d1-4933-9ca9-4c1ab230ebab"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Vaccines against measles are highly effective at preventing the infection and its knock-on effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: FatCamera/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="571be1a2-0967-48ae-99ce-87e4471aee0e"&gt;"It's just much harder in terms of personnel going out and doing case investigations," Winter told Live Science. Because so many people are susceptible in these communities, public health officials may have a harder time cataloging an infected person's contacts and encouraging them to isolate or to receive a post-exposure vaccine, which can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/420-250-MeaslesHCFPEP.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/420-250-MeaslesHCFPEP.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prevent or reduce the severity of a measles infection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can't stop a transmission chain within 12 months," Winter said, "it really signals the idea that we don't have control of this pathogen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has seen 45 measles outbreaks and 1,723 confirmed cases in 2025, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covering up to Nov. 12. To determine if any of these outbreaks are connected, indicating ongoing transmission, public health officials investigate each case, looking for times and places when infected individuals may have overlapped with others who caught the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also do genetic testing to determine whether the measles strains behind the cases are related or whether the infection came from a separate introduction. Most travel-related cases occur when a susceptible U.S. resident travels abroad to an area where measles is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Winter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2c3ae67f-d736-40c3-bc6e-adca623ccfff"&gt;This week, public health officials said in a call between federal and state agencies that the West Texas outbreaks were linked to the ongoing Utah and Arizona outbreaks, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/cdc-links-measles-outbreaks-in-multiple-states-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/cdc-links-measles-outbreaks-in-multiple-states-for-the-first-time/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If those findings hold, the U.S. will lose its status in January unless the Arizona and Utah outbreaks end without further transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the confirmed U.S. cases so far this year, 92% have been in unvaccinated individuals and another 4% happened in individuals who have had only their first MMR dose. The recommended MMR dosing schedule is to get the first dose at age 1 and the second between age 4 and 6. To get a handle on measles again, Hijano said, the U.S. will have to boost its nationwide vaccination rate back to above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as we don't have that high rate of immunizations," he said, "there will always be cases of measles that come from another country or another area that will find a place to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="87f7b2af-70b1-4cc4-b5c3-188695d9a156"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WACO, Texas — The Texas Department of Agriculture is warning of an equine virus outbreak linked to an event in Central Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department issued an alert to horsemen regarding an outbreak of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 (EHV-1) reported by veterinarians after the recent World Championship Barrel Racing (WPRA) Finals in the Waco area Nov. 5-9, according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are asking horse owners, trainers, or venue operators who attended or were in proximity to the event to monitor their animals carefully. Horse owners or facility operators who recently participated in large multi-barn gatherings, roping jackpots, or traveled extensively, including in the Waco region are also urged to monitor and take precautions, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This virus can spread fast, it can be deadly, and the earliest signs are often so subtle they’re easy to miss,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. “That’s why monitoring your horses right now is critical. The quicker we identify a potential case, the better chance we have to protect not only our animals, but the entire Texas equine community.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say "a particularly aggressive" strain of EHV-1 was confirmed by veterinary clinics in Central Texas, and an investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses can transmit EHV-1 through nose-to-nose contact or aerosolized particles released when an infected animal coughs or sneezes, officials say. It can also spread indirectly through shared tack, grooming tools, water and feed buckets, thermometers or other equipment. Humans can also unintentionally act as carriers by spreading the virus via their hands, clothing or boots, according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;Symptoms of EHV-1&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasal discharge, coughing, or other respiratory changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression or lethargy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurological signs: stumbling or incoordination, loss of tail tone, hind-limb weakness, recumbency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abortions in pregnant mares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended steps&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Isolate any horse that attended the Waco event for at least 14 days from other equines, or until cleared by a veterinarian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Suspend hauling, showing, or mixing horses from the exposure group until further notice. Avoid taking exposed horses to other barns or events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Disinfect trailers, wash-racks, cross-ties, tie-areas, tack rooms, buckets, grooming tools, and any shared equipment. Use an appropriate virucidal disinfectant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Avoid sharing tack, halters, grooming equipment, buckets, water hoses, etc., between exposed and unexposed horses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Monitor temperatures twice daily for all exposed horses and report any fever (≥101.5 °F) or other signs to a veterinarian immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;If any horse exhibits neurologic signs, coughing, or nasal discharge, isolate it immediately, wear protective gear, and call your veterinarian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Keep accurate records: track which horses were present at events, their movement, and who handled them for contact tracing if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Stay in contact with your local veterinarian and keep up to date on updates from state veterinary authorities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The cells expressing green fluorescent protein (HaCat&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells) were established by lentivirus transfection of GFP plasmids into HaCat cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai Genechem). All of the cell lines were incubated in a nutritious DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice (aged 6–8 weeks, 25 g) and female Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (aged 8–12 weeks, 200 g) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal. The mice and rats were housed in the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Guangxi Bama-minipigs (male, aged 6 months, 35–40 kg) were purchased from Shanghai Jiagan Laboratory Animal and housed in the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University. The animals were fed with a standard diet and maintained under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle, with free access to water throughout the experiment unless otherwise specified. The ambient environment was controlled at 20–26 °C and 50–70% relative humidity. All of the animal experiments were carried out according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University (ZJU20250230).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec4"&gt;Experimental materials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, all materials were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Dichloromethane (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled over calcium hydride (CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or treated with a 4 Å molecular sieve. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN), 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-ethylenediamine, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) were purchased from Energy Chemical.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 5 nm) were purchased from Feynman Biotechnology. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Succinimidyl 15-azido-4,7,10,13-tetraoxapentadecanoate (NHS-PEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was purchased from Aikon. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-succinimidyl 4-[(5-aza-3,4:7,8-dibenzocyclooct-1-yne)-5-yl]-4-oxobutyrate (DBCO-NHS) was purchased from New Research Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec5"&gt;Synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-[2-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tert-butoxycarbonylamino)]ethyl-4-(dodecyltrithio-carbonate)-4-cyanopenteramide (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-CTA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTA (2 mmol), EDC·HCl (2.5 mmol) and HOBT (2.5 mmol) were dissolved in 20 ml dry CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and stirred at room temperature for 4 h. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-ethylenediamine (2.5 mmol) and DIPEA (2.5 mmol) were dissolved in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (10 ml) and added dropwise to the above solution to continue the reaction overnight at room temperature. The mixture was successively washed twice with a saturated solution of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a 0.1 M HCl solution and a saturated brine solution, and then dried over MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The crude product was passed through a column packed with silica gel using a mobile phase of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane and ethyl acetate mixture (1:1). A yellow solid was obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec6"&gt;Synthesis of Boc-amino-terminated poly[2-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-PDMA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DMA (30 mmol), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-CTA (0.35 mmol) and AIBN (0.07 mmol) were dissolved in THF (30 ml) in a Schlenk flask and bubbled with dry N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 20 min. The reaction was carried out at 65 °C for 12 h. After terminating the polymerization by opening the flask, the solution was concentrated and poured into cold &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane. The precipitated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-PDMA was isolated and then dried under a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec7"&gt;Synthesis of Boc-amino-terminated poly[2-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-OP)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-PDMA (0.5 g) was dissolved in 5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and then dialysed against deionized water to remove the unreacted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; completely. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-OP was obtained after lyophilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec8"&gt;Synthesis of OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
                     &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-OP (500 mg) dissolved in 5 ml CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 5 ml TFA was added dropwise under ice cooling. This solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction solution was evaporated to remove TFA, vacuum-dried and then dissolved in deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and then dialysed against deionized water. OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained after lyophilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Synthesis of OP-DBCO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (30 mg) was dissolved in 3 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), and DBCO-NHS (3 mg) in 2 ml of DMF was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and then dialysed sequentially against a water-DMF mixture (3:2 (v/v)) and water. The product, OP-DBCO, was obtained by lyophilization. PEG-DBCO was prepared according to the same procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Synthesis of OP–I&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lysine residue on insulin was introduced with an azide group using N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NHS. Insulin (21.6 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.1 M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (adjusted to pH 10), and N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NHS (1.44 mg, 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in DMSO) was added at an azido-to-amine ratio of 1:3. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and the azide-modified insulin (insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was purified using preparative HPLC (prep-HPLC). For OP–I synthesis, insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2 mg, 0.29 μmol) and OP-DBCO (3.9 mg, 0.88 μmol) were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) and stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The product, OP–I, was purified using prep-HPLC. PEG–I was synthesized similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Labelling OP, OP–I, PEG–I and insulin with FITC, Cy3 or Cy5&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FITC, Sulfo-Cy3-NHS or Sulfo-Cy5-NHS solutions in DMSO (5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were added dropwise with gentle stirring to OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PEG-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, insulin or their conjugates (OP–I or PEG–I) dissolved in PBS (10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, pH 7.4) at a dye-to-insulin molar ratio of 1:1. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature in the dark. The labelled polymers, insulin and conjugates were purified using Sephadex G-25 resin to remove the unreacted dye and then lyophilized. The products were stored in the dark at 4 °C for further use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;RP-HPLC analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RP-HPLC analysis was performed using a 1260 binary HPLC pump equipped with a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) and a 1260 infinity II variable wavelength detector set at 280 nm. The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1% TFA (phase A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (phase B). The flow rate was set at 1 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The elution gradient was set as follows: 30% to 40% B, 0–5 min; constant 40% B, 5–10 min; 40% to 100% B, 10–11 min; constant 100% B, 11–16 min; 100% to 30% B, 16–17 min; constant 30% B, 17–22 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Stability of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;
                     &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4 mg) was incubated in 200 μl of DMEM culture medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C. The solution was sampled at 0 h, 6 h and 12 h for RP-HPLC detection (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3 per timepoint), as described above, except that an Agilent 1260 Infinity II fluorescence detector (640 nm excitation, 660 nm emission) was used. The mobile phase remained the same, but the elution gradient was as follows: 0%–100% B, 0–15 min; isocratic at 100% B, 15–20 min; 100%–0% B, 20–21 min; and isocratic at 0% B, 21–26 min. OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; had a retention time of 8.8 min. The target peak integral area was quantified, confirming its structural stability even after 12 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Prep-HPLC for purification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prep-HPLC was performed using the Waters Prep 150 LC system equipped with a Pursuit 5 C18 column (250 × 21.2 mm) and a Waters 2489 UV/VIS detector set at 214 nm and 280 nm. The mobile phases included water with 0.1% TFA (phase A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (phase B). The elution gradient and flow rates were set as follows: 20% to 40% B with flow rates increasing from 10 to 15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0–10 min; constant 40% B with a constant flow rate of 15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 10–20 min. The retention times were 11.8 min for insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; 10.1 min for OP–I and 12.8 min for PEG–I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Gel-permeation chromatography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shimadzu Prominence Plus LC-20AD LC system was equipped with two columns connected in series (PL aquagel-OH MIXED-H and PL aquagel-OH 30), a refractive index detector and a UV/VIS detector. The mobile phase was prepared by mixing acetic acid (100 ml), acetonitrile (150 ml) and deionized water (200 ml). The pH was then adjusted to 2.3 using a concentrated ammonia solution, and the final volume was brought to 500 ml with deionized water. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the column temperature was 40 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Circular dichroism spectroscopy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 37 °C on the JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter. Quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm were used. Each spectrum was an average of four scans recorded from 260 to 200 nm at 1 nm steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;MALDI-TOF MS analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed on a Bruker Autoflex maX TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker), equipped with a modified Nd:YAG laser in positive-ion mode; data acquisition was conducted using the Bruker flexControl 3.4 software. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix. As OP did not generate detectable signals in mass spectra owing to its zwitterionic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide structure, the OP–I was then reduced to PDMA-I by bis(pinacolato)diboron&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Kokatla, H.

A Nano ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments) was used to measure the zeta potentials using a 4 mW 633 nm He-Ne laser at 25 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Synthesis of OP–AuNPs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (60 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml of PBS (pH 8.0), and 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut’s reagent, 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and dialysed against water (MWCO 1 kDa) to remove the unreacted components. The product was lyophilized to obtain OP-SH. OP-SH (1 mg) was added to a solution of AuNPs (50 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stirred at 4 °C for 12 h. The resulting OP–AuNPs were purified by centrifugation at 19,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;In vivo skin permeation of OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;, OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt;, OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; and their mixtures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dorsal skin of male C57BL/6J mice was exposed using depilatory cream and cleaned using PBS.

Fluorescence images were taken using CLSM with excitation at 405 nm for DAPI, 488 nm for BODIPY or FITC, and 640 nm for OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;. The CLSM images were analysed using ImageJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; solution (0.2 ml, Cy5-equivalent dose, 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was applied to the mice as described above. Blood samples (200 μl) were collected from the orbit venous plexus at timed intervals, and their Cy5 fluorescence intensities were measured using a microplate spectrophotometer with excitation at 640 nm. The main organs of the mice, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys, were also collected at timed topical administration of OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;, and their fluorescence intensities were measured using the IVIS Spectrum imaging system (IVIS Lumina XRMS Series III, PerkinElmer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; was dispersed in a cream (water-in-oil, Aquaphor; Cy5-equivalent dose, 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at timed intervals. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using the IVIS Spectrum system. The insulin concentration was also measured using human insulin ELISA kits (Elabscience). The half-lives of insulin and OP–I were calculated using DAS2 software based on the plasma concentration data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;HAADFI–STEM-EDS analysis of OP–AuNP-treated skin cryosections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6J male mice were topically administered with 0.2 ml OP–AuNPs (OP-equivalent dose, 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 4 h, the mice were anaesthetized. The skin at the treated site was dissected and fixed overnight at 4 °C. The samples were trimmed into small sections and then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide (diluted in 100 mM cacodylate buffer) for 2 h, dehydrated with ethanol and acetone, and embedded in Spurr resin. Then, 10-μm-thick slices were sectioned (LKB 11800 Pyramitome) and stained with toluidine blue to select the desired regions. The ultrathin sections (50–100 nm) were prepared using an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAADFI STEM-EDS analysis of the skin cryosections was performed on a field emission transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM F200) at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV equipped with an EDS detector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Cellular uptake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AML-12 cells, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes and MSMC cells were seeded into confocal dishes at a density of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml and incubated for 24 h.

After incubation, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μM) for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and imaged using CLSM at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm for Hoechst 33342 and 640 nm for Cy5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;SPR analysis of binding affinity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore X100 instrument (Cytiva) with data acquisition using Biacore X100 system control software (v.2.0.1.201). The CM5 chip sensor (GE Healthcare) was used in this study. Anti-His antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the CM5 chip sensor according to the manufacturer’s instructions. His-tag-ECD-IR/IGF1R protein (Sino Biological) was then injected over the anti-His antibody-coated surface of the CM5 chip sensor at a specific concentration and flow rate. The binding affinities of insulin and OP–I were evaluated by injecting various concentrations of insulin (9.75, 19.5, 39.0, 78.0 and 156 nM) or OP–I (4.06, 8.13, 16.3, 32.5 and 65.0 nM) in HEPES running buffer (pH 7.4) over the His-tag-ECD-IR/IGF1R-coated surface under a single-cycle kinetics mode. Each cycle included a 180 s binding phase and a 300 s dissociation phase. The dissociation equilibrium constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), association rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) and dissociation rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;) were determined using the BIA evaluation software (v.2.0.1.201). The &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; values, which define the residence time, were determined using the formula ln2/&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Western blotting for insulin signalling analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were injected subcutaneously with PBS or insulin (insulin-equivalent dose, 5 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), or topical administration with OP–I (insulin-equivalent dose, 116 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; concentration, 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; volume, 0.2 ml; diffusing area, 1.13 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The mice were euthanized, and their skeletal muscle tissues were collected at 1 h after subcutaneous injection or 4 h after topical administration. Muscle samples were weighed and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C and quantified using the BCA protein assay. The proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer with 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% BSA for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies against phosphorylated IRβ/IGF1Rβ (1:1,000), phosphorylated AKT-Thr308 (1:1,000) or GAPDH (1:5,000). After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (HRP-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or HRP-labelled Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)) at a dilution of 1:1,000 at room temperature for 1 h. Signal detection was performed using Immobilon Forte chemiluminescence substrate on the ChemiScope 3600 Mini Imaging System (Clinx Science Instruments). The membranes were next incubated in stripping buffer (BL526, Biosharp) at room temperature with gentle agitation for 15 min, followed by extensive washing with TBST, and then overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies against IRβ and AKT. The membranes were processed as previously described, including incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and signal detection through chemiluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;OP–I permeation in 3D skin equivalent EpiKutis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D skin model (EpiKutis) was fabricated according to a previously reported method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Chen, L. et al.

Before production runs, the lipid system was equilibrated for 100 ns; then, 200-ns runs were conducted to monitor insulin, OP or OP–I adsorption on the SC lipids. After adsorptions, three independent 100-ns runs were further performed for insulin, OP or OP–I to monitor their diffusions on SC lipids.

The PMF setups were similar to the aforementioned MD setups to estimate the energy barriers for the diffusion of insulin, OP or OP–I on the SC lipids. The total transverse distance along each representative path was 2 nm, which was divided into 20 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm. Position restraints were applied to the SC lipids when the energy barriers were scanned. For monitoring the adsorption of insulin, OP, or OP–I on SC lipids, the simulation boxes were extended to 11.4 × 11.4 × 22.1 nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by adding 0.15 mM NaCl solution in the boxes. After a further 30-ns equilibration, the sampling path of each system was obtained by pulling insulin, OP or OP–I in the perpendicular (&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) direction to the SC lipid membrane with a constant velocity of 0.2 nm ns&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The total sampling distance in the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; direction was 9 nm for each system, which was divided into 90 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm.

To evaluate the binding affinity of insulin or OP–I with IR, the sampling path of each system was determined by pulling insulin or OP–I perpendicular to the IR surface at a constant velocity of 0.2 nm ns&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The total sampling distance of 5 nm was divided into 50 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm.

HaCat cells were suspended in fresh DMEM medium (containing 0.12% (w/v) methylcellulose) at a density of 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml. The cell suspensions (25 μl) were dropped onto the lids of the cell culture plate to form uniform droplets, and 20 ml PBS was added to the plate to keep the droplets moist. The cells were incubated for 72 h and formed dense spheroids, which were transferred to an agarose-coated (1% (w/v) in PBS) 96-well plate with one spheroid per well and incubated for another 72 h to mature.

The spheroids were washed with PBS and imaged using CLSM by &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack tomoscan at 20 μm intervals from the bottom to the middle of the spheroids. The integration of FITC fluorescence density and linescan analysis were performed using Image J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the effects of the endocytosis and exocytosis inhibitors on the penetration of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt;, the HaCat spheroids were separately treated with PBS, wortmannin (2 μM), cytochalasin D (20 μM), monensin (20 μM), nocodazole (10 μM) or brefeldin A (10 μM) for 2 h, and then incubated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt; (FITC-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 4 h.

The cells were then incubated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; (Cy5-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 12 h and then extensively rinsed with sterilized PBS and isolated. The OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;-treated HaCat cells were mixed with untreated HaCat&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells at the same cell density. The mixed cells were co-cultured in DMEM medium for 12 h and imaged with CLSM with excitation at 488 nm for GFP and 640 nm for Cy5. The mixed cells co-cultured in DMEM medium for 3 h, 6 h or 12 h were further isolated and analysed by flow cytometry. First, an FSC-A versus SSC-A gate was applied to exclude debris and select live cells based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) characteristics. Next, a GFP gate (FL1-H) was set to include cells with fluorescence in the GFP channel, followed by establishing a Cy5 gate (FL4-H) to isolate Cy5-positive cells. Finally, an intersection gate between the GFP and Cy5 gates was used to identify dual-positive cells. Every 10,000 cells were counted to determine GFP-positive cells at the FL1 channel and Cy5-positive cells at the FL4 channel. The experiment was repeated three times independently; FlowJo (v.10.0) software was used for analysis. The transfer efficiency of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; to HaCat&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells was calculated according to the formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{Transfer}\,\mathrm{efficiency}( \% )=\frac{{\mathrm{Number\; of\; HaCat}}^{\mathrm{GFP}+\mathrm{Cy}5}\,\mathrm{cells}}{\mathrm{Total\; counted\; number\; of}\,{\mathrm{HaCat}}^{\mathrm{GFP}}\,\mathrm{cells}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Non-contact inhibition of intercellular transfer of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;

The cells on the coverslips were washed with PBS, and the cell membrane was stained with NBD-C6-HPC (1 μM) for 5 min. The cells were imaged with CLSM at 488 nm excitation for NBD-C6-HPC and 640 nm for Cy5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Intercellular transfer between cells on separate coverslips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two coverslips were seeded with HaCat cells (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; each) and cultured overnight to ensure full adherence.

Coverslip 1 was placed on top of the other coverslip with untreated HaCat cells (coverslip 2) and pressed slightly. The coverslips were cultured together in DMEM medium for 0.5 or 1 h and then observed using CLSM for the transfer of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;TIRFM imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HaCat cells were seeded onto a confocal dish at a density of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy3&lt;/sup&gt; (Cy3-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was added. After 4 h, NBD-C6-HPC was added to stain the cell membrane for 5 min, and the cells were then washed three times with PBS. Time-lapse imaging of the cell membrane was conducted using the TIRF function of an Olympus IX83 microscope.

DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Plasmids expressing epegRNAs were constructed by Gibson assembly using a custom acceptor plasmid. Sequences of sgRNA and epegRNA constructs used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. All vectors for mammalian cell experiments were purified using Plasmid Plus Midiprep kits (Qiagen) or PureYield plasmid miniprep kits (Promega), which include endotoxin removal steps. All experiments using live animals were approved by the Broad Institute Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committees. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;General mammalian cell culture conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell lines with homozygous PTCs in &lt;i&gt;TPP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HEXA &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;NPC1&lt;/i&gt;were generated using prime editing. HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216), Neuro-2a (ATCC CCL-131) and HeLa (CCL-2) cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured and passaged in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) plus GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, qualified). All cell types were incubated, maintained, and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cell lines were authenticated by their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Generation of cell lines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEK293T cells were seeded at 100,000 cells per well on 24-well plates (Corning). 16–24 h after seeding, cells were transfected at approximately 60% confluency with 600 ng, 200 ng and 60 ng of PEmax plasmid, epegRNA plasmid and ngRNA plasmid, respectively using Lipofectamine 3000 according to manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4 d after transfection, single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution cloning and expanded over a 2-week period. The resulting colonies were further expanded and genotyped by high-throughput sequencing of the targeted locus and those found to be homozygous for the expected edit were retained for downstream experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Lentiviral production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEK293Ts (ATCC CRL-3216) were transfected with pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and delta8.2 (Addgene Plasmid #8455) packaging plasmids alongside the appropriate lentiviral backbone using Lipofectamine 2000. Lentiviral backbone sequences used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection. Virus was used immediately or stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week before cell transduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;General high-throughput lentiviral screening protocol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All oligonucleotides for high-throughput screening were ordered from Twist Biosciences as single-stranded oligonucleotide pools. Oligonucleotide pools were amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to create double-stranded inserts for isothermal assembly. Primers used are indicated in each specific screening section of the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#Sec16"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;. The minimum number of PCR cycles was used to amplify (typically between 11 and 13 cycles) and double-stranded inserts were checked for size and/or inappropriate products by TapeStation (Agilent). For each 20-μl reaction cloned into the pSEP0308, pSEP0309 or pSEP0310 lentiviral backbones with a 300-bp insert, 50 ng of the appropriate lentiviral backbone was assembled with 10 ng of the appropriate double-stranded insert using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB E2621L). Reactions were scaled according to the number of elements in the library. For each 1,000 elements, an additional 20-μl reaction was set up. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h and then pooled and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reaction products were eluted in a minimum of 20 μl ddH2O, but otherwise were eluted in 2.5 μl per original 20-μl reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isothermal assembly reactions were electroporated into NEB 10-beta Electrocompetent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (NEB C3020) and plated onto LB plates aiming for at least 1,000× coverage of each library element. 14 h later, colonies were scraped and prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Plus kits (Qiagen 12945 and 12963) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled plasmids were transfected into HEK293Ts alongside lentiviral packaging plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection. Cells were transduced with virus aiming for a multiplicity of infection of 0.3. Cells were transduced to ensure ≥1,000× coverage of transduced cells per element of the library. 2 d after transduction, cells were passaged with 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin for 3–4 days to enrich for transduced cells. For screens requiring FACS isolation of GFP-positive cells, we calculated approximate coverage by multiplying the per cent of GFP-positive cells by the number of elements in the library and aiming for 1,000× coverage of that number. For example, if 10% of cells were GFP-positive for a 500 element library, we sorted at least 50,000 cells per replicate. Cells were pelleted and flash frozen on dry ice. Genomic DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Micro kits (Qiagen 56304) or QIAamp Mini kits (Qiagen 51304) depending on the cell number isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All genomic DNA for each replicate was input into an initial set of PCR reactions using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to amplify the integrated lentiviral cassette and to add sequencing adapters, with a maximum of 5 μg genomic DNA per 50-μl reaction. Primers used are indicated in each screening section and are also listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer’s instructions and 2 μl of PCR product was input into a second PCR reaction to add unique sample indices and flow cell adapters to each amplicon. Final PCR reactions were bead purified with a ratio of 0.7× using SPRI beads, quality controlled using a TapeStation (Agilent) and quantified using a Qubit prior to high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq, Illumina NextSeq, or Element Biosciences AVITI instrument. Sequencing conditions and downstream analyses are specific to each screen and are indicated in each separate screening section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;PE2 screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To convert each endogenous tRNA into a sup-tRNA, we identified 418 high-confidence tRNA genes and identified the two closest 20-bp spacers with an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif upstream and downstream of the anticodon. We allowed prime editing to target multiple tRNAs in the case of identical mature tRNA sequences. We systematically varied the PBS lengths from 11 bp to 14 bp, and varied the RTT homology lengths 3′ of the last edited nucleotide from 6 bp to 10 bp, where feasible. We designed three prime editing screens, each with RTTs that replaced the anticodon of each endogenous tRNA with one of three sup-tRNA anticodons (CUA, UCA or UUA). To enhance prime editing efficiency, we appended a structured RNA motif, tevopreQ1, to the 3′ end of each pegRNA, creating epegRNAs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Nelson, J. W. et al. Engineered pegRNAs improve prime editing efficiency. Nat. Biotechnol. 40, 402–410 (2022)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#ref-CR29" id="ref-link-section-d47934593e1974"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In total, we designed 17,579 epegRNAs to convert endogenous tRNAs to sup-tRNAs for each of the three possible sup-tRNA anticodons. Each pool also included 420 control epegRNAs targeting serine and arginine tRNAs, swapping their anticodons for those of other serine and arginine anticodons, which are not expected to give signal in a readthrough-based screen (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). We included a unique barcode sequence 3′ of the polyT terminator sequence for each epegRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. The final oligonucleotides had the following design: a common 5′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-tatcttgtggaaaggacgaaacacc-3′), a unique epegRNA sequence followed by a polyT for Pol III termination, an adjustable length linker used to ensure that each element of the library was the same length, a unique 25 bp barcode, and a common 3′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-ctcgagtactaggatccattaggcg-3′). Oligonucleotides were amplified using oSEP0114 and oSEP0115 prior to isothermal assembly into a linearized pSEP0308 with a hU6 promoter for driving expression of the epegRNAs. Final libraries for next generation sequencing were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using oSEP0213 as a custom Read1 primer with 300 cycles. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Lentiviral sup-tRNA screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate a wide range of tRNA promoter variants in high-throughput, we took the 418 high-confidence tRNA sequences from the human genome and swapped their anticodon to CUA, UCA or UUA to target the stop codons TAG, TGA or TAA, respectively. A unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. We cloned this pool using isothermal assembly into three different lentiviral backbones to evaluate the effect of different upstream elements on sup-tRNA efficacy: pSEP0308, which has a hU6 promoter, pSEP0309, which has a minU6 promoter and pSEP0310, which contains no exogenous promoter. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Leader and terminator sequence screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the initial leader sequence screen, the 40 bp upstream of each endogenous high-confidence tRNA in the human genome was determined and placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its anticodon changed to CUA followed by a polyT termination sequence. As controls, the same leader sequences were placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its native anticodon. Libraries were sequenced and exact matching was used for both the leader sequence and the anticodon region of the read to assign to the correct library element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM6"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To next screen leader sequences across a wide range of sup-tRNAs, we generated a lentiviral library containing six leader sequences (two top-performing, two bottom-performing and two random sequences) paired with 418 human tRNAs with their anticodons switched to CUA, UCA or UAA. We also assessed the effect of each terminator sequence when placed downstream of sup-tRNAs paired with their endogenous leader sequences, with a total of 11,543 combinations of leader sequence, sup-tRNA and terminator. We included a unique 20-bp barcode sequence 3′ of the terminator sequence for each tRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 20-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 20-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM7"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Saturation mutagenesis screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To design variants for saturation mutagenesis screening, every sequence containing a SNV, paired substitution at all hairpin positions, and 1-bp deletion was generated computationally. Then, 25 bp ends compatible with isothermal assembly were added to either side (see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) and a unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. Variants were ordered as a Twist oligonucleotide pool for each individual tRNA for tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1, tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 (sequences in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM8"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). A pooled library of all possible variants for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1, and tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 was ordered as a separate Leu-TAA focused library (sequences in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM9"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 screens, Twist oligonucleotides contained a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0310 lentiviral backbone with no exogenous Pol III promoter. For the tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 and Leu-TAA focused library, Twist oligonucleotides did not contain a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0308 lentiviral backbone with an exogenous hU6 promoter driving expression of the tRNAs. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina instrument with 26 cycles for Read1 covering the barcode region and 86 cycles for Read2 covering the tRNA region. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 25-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 25-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;epegRNA optimization with synthetic target-site screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To optimize epegRNA architectures, we designed a lentiviral epegRNA library of 17,280 epegRNAs to test out five spacer variants, PBS lengths from 8 to 16 nt, RTT lengths from 21 to 36 nt, and combinations of each of the 19 mutation variants of interest alongside 720 control epegRNAs with RTTs that do not encode an anticodon edit. On the same oligonucleotide, we encoded an adjacent tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 synthetic target site directly adjacent to the lentiviral epegRNA to read out both the epegRNA and the outcome of editing in the same sequencing read. We transfected cells transduced with this library with a panel of prime editor proteins that included PEmax and several engineered PE6 variants&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Doman, J.

For experiments in HeLa cells, we collected genomic DNA 3 d after transfection. For experiments in HEK293T cells, we collected genomic DNA at 3 d and 9 d after transfection. We then performed high-throughput sequencing of the lentivirally integrated cassette. For analysis, sequencing reads were initially demultiplexed into individual fastq files by first aligning each read to a corresponding member of the epegRNA library using bowtie2 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Langmead, B. &amp;amp; Salzberg, S.

These sequences were cloned into the pSEP0211 lentiviral backbone between mCherry and GFP via Gibson assembly. Two days following transduction, we extracted both mRNA and genomic DNA from the transduced cell population, generated cDNA by reverse transcription, and sequenced the integrated reporter construct from both the cDNA and genomic DNA samples. For analysis, we calculated an ‘RNA score’ metric by quantifying the frequency of each element in the cDNA and dividing that value by the frequency of that element in the genomic DNA. To control for the impact each unique sequence context might have on transcript expression level independent of readthrough activity, we defined a ‘readthrough score’ for each ClinVar PTC by dividing the RNA score of each variant by the RNA score of its corresponding no-premature-stop equivalent.

To account for target-site binding and potential annealing of the full-length RTT product, we extracted the local sequence surrounding these sites to include 3 bp upstream of the putative target site and 34 bp downstream. We included 100 uniquely barcoded positive-control sequences corresponding to the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 site and 694 negative-control sequences that shared no homology with the epegRNA spacer sequence. These sequences were cloned into the pSEP0310 lentiviral backbone and transduced into HEK293T cells after lentiviral production. These cells were then transfected with an epegRNA expression plasmid alone as a negative control, or with a PE6c prime editor expression plasmid alongside the epegRNA expression plasmid. 3 d after transfection, genomic DNA was isolated and the lentiviral integrated target site was amplified for high-throughput sequencing. The amplified target-site was sequenced using 2× 115 paired-end high-throughput sequencing. For analysis, high-throughput sequencing reads were initially demultiplexed into individual fastq files by first aligning each read to a corresponding member of the target-site library using bowtie2 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Langmead, B. &amp;amp; Salzberg, S.

In brief, the sequence encoded by the RTT was compared base-by-base to the nucleotide sequence 3′ of the cas9 nick site of each potential off-target site with an ‘off-target marker’ sequence being identified as the minimal deviating sequence between the two. The presence of this off-target marker sequence was quantified using output from CRISPResso2 and was used as a proxy for off-target prime editing.

A pooled sequencing primer was generated for nominated human off-target sites using the rhAmpSeq design tool (IDT). Genomic DNA was extracted from editor-treated HEK293T cells and amplified with rhAmpSeq pooled sequencing primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The amplified libraries were sequenced with 300-bp single-end reads with an Illumina MiSeq. Sequences for rhAmpSeq amplicons were extracted using the R Bioconductor BSGenome package (v.1.4.3) using the GRCh37/hg19 (human) reference genomes. CRISPResso2 was used to align the rhAmpSeq reads to the amplicon reference sequences and quantify the number of reads with each possible edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in media containing 10% FBS, and the solution was filtered through a 45-μm cell strainer prior to flow cytometry or FACS isolation.

A total of 200 ng, 66 ng and 22 ng of prime editor plasmid, epegRNA plasmid and ngRNA plasmid (where indicated), respectively, were transfected per well. 3 d after transfection, cells were lysed and genomic DNA was collected by incubation in a lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% SDS and 800 units per μl of proteinase K (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by enzyme inactivation at 80 °C for 30 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rescue experiments performed in the HEK293T disease models, cells were initially seeded at 200,000 cells per well in 12-well plates (Corning). The following day, cells were transfected with 700 ng of PE6c prime editor plasmid, 200 ng of epegRNA plasmid and 75 ng of ngRNA plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 3 d after transfection, genomic DNA was extracted as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Protein isolation and enzymatic activity assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For assays using human cells, cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. For the tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP1) assay, pelleted cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. For the hexosaminidase (HEXA) assay, pelleted cells were lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. In both cases, lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For both HEXA and TPP1 assays, the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay was determined by a standard curve derived from measurements of known quantities of wild-type protein lysate (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM1"&gt;10b,c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the TPP1 assay, 10 μg of protein lysate was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 4 containing the Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Sigma, A3401) at a final concentration of 250 μM in a reaction volume of 40 μl. Endpoint fluorescence was then measured with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 460 nm (20 nm bandwidth). Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence values from each treatment condition by the mean fluorescence values of mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the HEXA assay, 5 μg of protein lysate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 containing either 4-methylumbelliferone-f-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine (MUG, Sigma, 69585) or 4-methylumbelliferone-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS, Sigma, 454428) substrate at a concentration of 3.2 mM.

Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth). HEXA activity was normalized to HEXB activity by dividing the mean fluorescence values from the MUGS (HEXA) reaction by the corresponding mean fluorescence values from the MUG (HEXB) reaction. Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the derived mean HEXA activity values for each treatment condition by that of the mean HEXA activity values from mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For measurements of α-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-iduronidase in mouse tissue, protein was extracted by first homogenizing the tissue using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) in T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78510) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C and supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 40 μg of whole protein lysate was incubated overnight in a 130 mM sodium formate buffer containing 0.42 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, S0375) and 4MU-iduronic acid (0.12 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-220961) at pH 3.5. Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Western blotting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 10 μg of whole protein lysate was separated by SDS–PAGE using a 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus Mini Protein Gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) then incubated in a 5% milk solution in 1 × Tris-Buffered Saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). The blocked membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight in NPC1 (Abcam, ab134113, 1:2,500 dilution) or GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc-47724, 1:5,000 dilution) primary antibody. The following day, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab6721; 1:10,000 dilution) for NPC1 and anti-mouse IgG (Abcam, ab205719; 1:10,000 dilution) for GAPDH for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was removed and the membrane was washed and signal was collected using the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Protein isolation, trypsin digestion and TMT labelling for mass spectrometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein was isolated as described for Western blotting. To prepare samples for mass spectrometry, samples were passed over S-trap micro spin columns (Profiti) according to manufacturer’s protocols with the following modifications: 10 mM DTT (final concentration) was used instead of TCEP. After adding DTT, tubes were placed on a heating block for 10 min at 95 °C. Disulfides were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration) instead of methyl methanethiosulfonate, and after adding the iodoacetamide the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark. After digestion with 5 µg trypsin (Thermo Fisher 90057), samples were desalted using Pierce Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher 89852) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The desalted tryptic peptides were resuspended in 100 µl of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB), vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. For labelling with tandem mass tags (TMTs), lyophilized TMTpro Label reagents (Thermo Fisher A44520) were used according to manufacturer’s protocols. At the time of labelling, aliquots were equilibrated at room temperature and 20 µl of anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each tube. The TMT reagents were vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and allowed to dissolve for 5 min at 25 °C. TMT reagents were added to each 100-µl sample, vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After 1 h, 5 µl of 5% hydroxylamine was added to each sample and incubated for 15 min to quench the reaction. Equal amounts of each labelled sample were then combined together and speed-vacuumed to dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;LC–MS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TMT-labelled tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Thermo Ultimate 3000) using a Thermo PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 µm tip, 75 µm x 50 cm ES903) over a gradient before nano-electrospray using a Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 60,000 across 450–1,600 &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; and maximum IT 50 ms. The full mass spectrometry scan was followed by MS/MS for as many precursor ions in a three-second cycle with a NCE of 32, dynamic exclusion of 30 s and resolution of 45,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Database search with Proteome Discoverer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Sequest HT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo). Sequest search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.02 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed cleavages of trypsin. Fixed modifications were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMTpro modification on lysines and peptide N termini. Variable modifications were methionine oxidation, methionine loss at the N terminus of the protein, acetylation of the N terminus of the protein, and methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N terminus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;AAV production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAV production was performed using HEK293T clone 17 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) maintained in DMEM plus GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS without antibiotic in 150 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The day before transfection cells were plated at a density of 18 million cells per 150 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plate. The following day, 5.7 μg of AAV genome plasmid, 11.4 μg of pHelper (Clontech) and 22.8 μg of rep-cap plasmid per plate were delivered via polyethyleneimine transfection (PEI MAX, Polysciences). Three days after transfection, cells were collected by cell scraping and pelleted at 3,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min. Medium was decanted into a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and NaCl at a final concentration of 8% PEG and 500 mM NaC and incubated on ice for 2 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic buffer containing 40 mM Tris base, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; salt active nuclease (ArcticZymes) and incubated for one hour at 37 °C. The medium-containing solution was then pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic lysis buffer and combined with the cell lysate. This lysate was then added to Beckman Coulter Quick-Seal tubes via 16-gauge, 5-inch needles (Air-Tite N165) in a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol in sequentially floating layers as follows: 9 ml of 15% iodixanol in 500 mM NaCl and 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK (1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2.5 mM KCl), 6 ml of 25% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK and 5 ml each of 40% and 60% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK with phenol red at a concentration of 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 15%, 25% and 60% layers to aid layer visualization This gradient was then ultracentrifuged using a fixed-angle Ti 70 rotor in an Optima XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 68,000 rpm for one hour at 18 °C. Next, 3 ml of virus-containing solution was extracted from the 40–60% iodixanol interface via an 18-gauge needle. Buffer was exchanged for cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.001% F-68 using a PES 100 kD MWCO column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concentrated. The resulting AAV-containing solution was sterile filtered using a 0.22-μm filter and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (AAVpro Titration Kit version 2, Clontech). Purified virus was stored at 4 °C until use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Animal use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments involving live animals were approved by the Broad Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (D16-00903; 0048-04-15-2). Mouse housing facilities were maintained at 20–22 °C with 30–50% humidity, on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard rodent diet and water. For experiments involving &lt;i&gt;Idua&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;W392X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we used Strain from Jackson Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Neonatal ventricular injections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringes for microinjection were prepared by pulling PCR Micropipettes (Drummond Scientific Company, 5-000-1001-X10) with the Sutter P1000 micropipette puller for a tip diameter size of 100 μm. The injection solution was prepared by mixing 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; vg of each half of prime editor encoding AAV and 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; vg of reporter AAV in 0.9% NaCl solution (Covetrus, 061758) in total volume of 4 μl, along with 0.1 μl of Fast Green. A total of 4 μl of injection solution was front-loaded to the micropipette syringe for injection. Neonatal mice were anaesthetized on ice. A total of 2 μl of injection solution was injected into each ventricle with successful injection being verified by the spread of Fast Green dye by transillumination of the head. Litters were randomized for injection with a given AAV composition. Both sexes were included for each experimental condition for in vivo experiments. Both sexes were assigned to each experimental group as evenly as possible. No statistics were performed to pre-determine sample size for each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;In vivo prime editing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments demonstrating readthrough of an exogenous reporter co-administered via AAV, we evaluated both TAG and TGA stop codon readthrough. To achieve TGA stop codon readthrough, we used the epegRNA architecture optimized for the introduction of the CUA anticodon but modified the 3′ extension to introduce a UCA anticodon. The reporter construct contained an eGFP expression cassette with either a TAG or TGA PTC at codon 81 or the wild-type glutamine codon. In experiments evaluating the long-term tolerability of PERT, we delivered editing reagents in the v3em dual-AAV architecture introducing either an CUA anticodon into the mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 gene, or a control +5 G-to-T edit in the &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; locus. At three weeks, the cortices and livers from mice were processed for whole proteome mass spectrometry to evaluate readthrough past natural stop codons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Mouse tissue collection, histology and immunohistochemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice used in this study were sacrificed by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asphyxiation, and unperfused tissues were immediately dissected. For protein and DNA analysis, dissected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction was performed as described above. Genomic DNA and RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For histology and immunohistochemistry, dissected tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then soaked in 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Following routine processing and paraffin embedding, tissue sections were stained with either haematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, or prepared for immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval using a sodium citrate buffer. After quenching endogenous peroxidase and application of a protein block (Dako), sections were incubated with either an anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab183734) or an anti-iduronidase (R&amp;amp;D systems, AF4119) antibody. Staining was detected using a species-specific detection kit, diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen, and Mayer’s Haematoxylin (Dako) was used as the counterstain. Primary antibodies were substituted with an appropriate negative-control IgG for negative-control slides. For Alcian blue staining, 4-μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were stained with the Alcian Blue–1%, pH 2.5 kit (Newcomer, 9102A).

A delay epoch started from the onset of the cue presentation. Licking during the delay epoch aborted the trial without a water reward, followed by a 1.5-s timeout epoch. Licking during the 10-s answer epoch following the delay was considered a ‘correct lick’, and a water reward (approximately 2 µl per drop) was delivered immediately, followed by a 1.5-s consumption epoch. If mice did not lick during the 10-s answer period, the trial would end without a reward. Trials were separated by an ITI randomly sampled from an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 s, with 1-s offset (with a maximum ITI of 7 s). This prevented mice from predicting the trial onset without a cue. Animals had to withhold licking during the full ITI epoch for the next trial to begin (otherwise, the ITI epoch repeated). In approximately 10% of randomly interleaved trials, the auditory cue was omitted to assess spontaneous lick rate (‘no-cue’ trials). No water reward was delivered in no-cue trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We followed the protocol described in Majumder et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Majumder, S. et al.

Once mice reached 1.8-s delay, we started either the switching delay, the random delay or the constant delay conditions (see Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for example sessions). In the switching delay condition, we switched the delay between 1 s versus 3 s or 1 versus 1.8 s every 30–70 trials (the number of trials was randomly selected from 30 to 70 and not contingent upon behaviour). Similarly, in the random delay condition, we randomly switched the delay among 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0 s every 30–70 trials. For the constant delay condition, mice were trained with a constant delay of 1.5 s across sessions for at least 2 weeks. For the cue-intensity experiments (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we changed the cue intensity (3-kHz auditory cue, ±15 dB, lasting 0.6 s) in randomly interleaved test trials (approximately 20%). Except for this modification, the task structure was identical. Cue intensity stayed constant (74 dB) before the cue-intensity experiments. Otherwise, the task design and reward contingency remained the same. ALM and striatal perturbation experiments (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;) were performed under the switching delay condition.

To prevent mice from distinguishing photostimulation trials from control trials using visual cues, a ‘masking flash’ (1-ms pulses at 10 Hz) was delivered using 470-nm LEDs (Luxeon Star) throughout the trial.

For the H-2 probes, voltage signals were multiplexed, recorded on a PCI6133 board (National Instruments) and digitized at 400 kHz (14-bit). All recordings were made with the open-source software SpikeGLX (&lt;a href="http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/"&gt;http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/&lt;/a&gt;).

For optogenetic experiments, we analysed trials with the first lick occurring after the onset time of photostimulation (0.6 s after the cue) in both control and photostimulated trials to compare the effect of photostimulation on behaviour. The no-lick rate was calculated as the probability of mice not responding within 5 s after the cue. The shift in lick time (Δlick time) was based on the median lick time. The post-stimulation lick rate (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig12"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) was calculated as the probability of mice licking within 0.6 s after the photostimulation offset time in no-cue trials. To analyse behaviour while the mice were engaged in the task, we analysed all trials between the first occurrence of five consecutive cue trials with licks and 20 trials before the last occurrence of three consecutive no-lick trials without photostimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to the attenuation of behavioral effects of optogenetic manipulation (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig12"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), we restricted analyses of both behavioural and physiological data to the first (for striatal manipulation) or the first two (for ALM manipulation) manipulation sessions per mouse. All analyses, including the calculation of confidence intervals and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values, were performed using a hierarchical bootstrap, unless stated otherwise. First, we randomly selected animals with replacements. Second, we randomly selected sessions for each animal with replacement. Third, we randomly selected trials for each session with replacements. Then, we calculated the behavioural metrics described above. This procedure was repeated 1,000 times to estimate the mean, confidence intervals and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1"&gt;Timer model and hazard rate analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To interpret the effects of optogenetic manipulations, we numerically simulated how different operations influence a timer, an accumulator that infers passage of time by integrating a constant input or periodic event, such as a water clock, hourglass, pendulum clock and quartz watch (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). We modelled time as a scalar variable representing the temporal integration of a constant inflow signal. Specifically, the internal representation of time &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) evolves according to the equation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$T(t)=\underset{0}{\overset{t}{\int }}r$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the inflow rate. A lick was triggered when &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) reached a fixed threshold &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; = 1. &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; was varied across trials (but constant within each trial) to match the empirically observed distribution of lick times (inverse Gaussian distribution IG(&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;) with &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 and &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; = 12; 10,000 iterations).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In addition to analysing lick-time distributions, we computed the hazard rate, defined as the instantaneous probability of a lick occurring at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, given that no lick has occurred yet. Mathematically, the hazard rate &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is computed as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is the probability density function and &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is the cumulative distribution function of lick times. This measure captures the moment-by-moment drive to lick and provides insight into the temporal dynamics of lick probability. We applied the same procedure to calculate hazard rate in the data. Both the data and the models were binned at 20 ms and smoothed with a boxcar filter over 5 bins. To quantify the temporal shift in hazard rate, we fitted the hazard rate (up to the time point where the cumulative distribution function reaches 80%; beyond that, the hazard function becomes noisier as the denominator becomes small) with a sigmoid function and estimated its 50% point.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We simulated the effects of two types of transient perturbation to the timer: pause (slowdown), in which the inflow rate &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is transiently reduced by the speed coefficient &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${r}_{\text{during}\text{manipulation}}={c\times r}_{\text{before}\text{manipulation}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Here &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; = 0 represents a complete pause, whereas larger values correspond to a slowdown (0.5 was used in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig6"&gt;6b&lt;/a&gt;). By contrast, in rewind, the timer state &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is transiently decreased as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$T(t)=T({t}_{\text{stim}\text{on}})+\underset{{t}_{\text{stim}\text{on}}}{\overset{{t}_{\text{stim}\text{off}}}{\int }}{r}_{\mathrm{decay}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;decay&lt;/sub&gt; is a negative value, and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stim on&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stim off&lt;/sub&gt; are the times of stimulation on and off, respectively. If &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) &amp;lt; 0, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) was set to zero. If &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) remained at zero for more than 320 ms, it was fixed at zero for the remainder of the trial, resulting in a no-lick outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In all cases, the manipulation lasted for 600 ms and linearly decayed over the final 300 ms, matching the experimental condition. These manipulations were applied across 10,000 trials to assess their effects on lick timing and hazard rate dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;For the linear regression analysis in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig2"&gt;2d&lt;/a&gt;, we tested 42 combinations of regressors with 1–6 lags with fivefold cross-validation (see Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for details). The median absolute deviation of lick time explained by different regression models was calculated as 1 − R1/R2, where R1 is the median of the absolute value of the model residuals, and R2 is the median of the absolute value of the null model residuals.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar4"&gt;Correlation in neural population activity&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To plot the correlation in neural population activity, we calculated the mean spike activity of individual neurons across trials with different lick-time ranges to yield a population activity matrix, with the number of rows equal to the number of neurons and the number of columns equal to the number of time points (200-ms bin). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, we calculated pairwise Pearson’s correlation of these population activity matrices between trials with lick times between 1.40 s and 1.55 s (reference trials) and the trials with other lick-time ranges. For Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the pairwise Pearson’s correlation between unperturbed trials with lick times between 1.4 s and 1.7 s (reference trials) and the photostimulation trials with lick times between 1.7 s and 2.0 s). As a control, we subselected unperturbed trials with lick times closest to the median lick time in the unperturbed condition (the number of trials was matched to the number of trials as in the photostimulation condition). The choice of reference trials did not qualitatively change the results. For each correlation matrix, we identified the points along the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; axis with the maximum correlation (above 0.8) for each time point, and repeated this procedure with the hierarchical bootstrap (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3d,i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4g,k&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5i,m&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar5"&gt;Single-cell analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To plot the PSTH of example cells, PSTHs were calculated based on 1-ms time bin and smoothed with a 200-ms causal boxcar filter unless specified otherwise. To temporally warp PSTH for individual cells, we linearly scaled the spike timing after the cue, based on the time from cue to lick. Specifically, Spike time&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; = Spike time&lt;sub&gt;original&lt;/sub&gt;/(LT&lt;sub&gt;trial to be warped&lt;/sub&gt;/LT&lt;sub&gt;target warp time&lt;/sub&gt;), where LT denotes the first lick time in each trial, and LT&lt;sub&gt;target warp time&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 s.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Across-trial variance (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2e–g&lt;/a&gt;) was calculated as the variance of spiking activity across trials for the original or temporally warped data (the across-trial variance was calculated for five 200-ms time windows after the cue and then averaged).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To quantify the number of cells that significantly increase or decrease spike rate before the lick compared with baseline, the trial-averaged spike rate of 0.2–0.5 s before the lick was compared with that of 0–1 s before the cue. Signed-rank tests were performed to determine whether the spike rate difference was significant.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the proportion of cells affected or unaffected by photostimulation (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5e&lt;/a&gt;), we analysed the spikes within the time window of 50–250 ms from the photostimulation onset time. To quantify the effect of photostimulation, trials with licks before the photostimulation onset time were excluded from the analysis. For individual cells, the spike rate in control and photostimulation trials was compared using the two-sided rank-sum test. Cells with a mean spike rate above 1 Hz during this window and more than 10 trials per condition were analysed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the partial rank correlation between the spike rate (in specific time windows) and the lick time in previous trials, removing the effect of upcoming lick time, for each cell (we only analysed trials after rewarded trials to avoid confound caused by the representation of rewards; analysis of previous unrewarded trials yielded similar results). Specifically, we calculated the rank correlation between spike rate (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) versus previous lick time (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {RP}\)&lt;/span&gt;), rank correlation between &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; versus upcoming lick time (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {RU}\)&lt;/span&gt;) and rank correlation between &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {PU}\)&lt;/span&gt;). Then, the partial correlation between spike rate versus lick time in the previous trial removing the effect of upcoming lick time is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\rho {RP}\cdot U=\frac{\rho {RP}-\rho {RU}\cdot \rho {PU}}{\sqrt{1-{\rho }^{2}{RU}}\sqrt{1-{\rho }^{2}{PU}}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;As controls, we performed a trial shuffle test, which shuffles the trial order and destroys trial history, and a session permutation test to avoid the confound of nonsensical correlations (1,000 iterations)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Harris, K.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar6"&gt;Single-cell ramping characterization&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2a–d&lt;/a&gt;, cells with more than 50 trials of lick time between 1.25 s and 1.5 s were used for firing pattern characterization. For each cell, PSTH was smoothed with a 200-ms causal boxcar filter. Trials were randomly split into halves and averaged to generate train and test data. We fit the activity of the train data from cue onset to the first lick time with different orders of polynomial functions (MATLAB polyfit function; tested order 1–8). We then calculated the mean squared error between the fit and the test data. The ‘best-fit order’ is the one with the lowest mean squared error. We repeated this procedure 10 times and defined the final order as the most frequent order among the 10 iterations. The best-fit data were then used to determine the monotonicity and the peak firing time of the cell. Monotonic firing cells are those whose derivative of the best polynomial fit remains consistently positive or negative values from cue onset to lick. Peak firing time was the time point between the cue and lick where the best polynomial fit had the highest firing rate.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar7"&gt;Dimensionality reduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We characterized population activity patterns between the cue and the lick by defining modes that differentiate the baseline activity during the ITI (0–1 s before the cue) from the activity during specific 300-ms time windows after the cue: 0–0.3 s after the cue (cue mode), 0.5–0.8 s before the lick (middle mode), 0.2–0.5 s before the lick (ramp mode) and 0–0.3 s after the lick (execution mode).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Specifically, to calculate ramp mode for a population of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; recorded neurons, we looked for an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; × 1 unit vector that maximally distinguished the mean activity before the trial onset (0–1 s before cue; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before cue&lt;/sub&gt;) and the mean activity before the first lick (0.2–0.5 s before the first lick; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before lick&lt;/sub&gt;) in the &lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;dimensional activity space. We defined a population ramping vector: &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before lick&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before cue&lt;/sub&gt;. Ramp mode is &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; normalized by its norm. Similarly, we defined cue mode, middle mode and execution mode using different time windows, and middle mode was orthogonalized to ramp mode, and cue mode was orthogonalized to both middle mode and ramp mode using the Gram–Schmidt process. Thus, the upper limit of the sum of square sum of task-modulated spiking activity explained (cue mode + middle mode + ramp mode) in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; is 1. Execution mode was orthogonalized to ramp mode (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To define the trial-history mode, we first calculated the predicted lick time in each trial by applying the linear regression model described in the ‘Trial-history regression analysis’ section for each recorded session. Specifically, the model included previous lick times and the interaction between previous lick time and outcome at lags 1 and 2. This predicted value estimates what the lick time would be if it were determined solely by recent behavioural history and reinforcement, according to the fitted regression model, thereby summarizing trial history as a single value for each trial. We then calculated the Spearman rank correlation between the spike rate during the ITI (0–1 s before the cue) and the predicted lick time across trials for each neuron, indicating how strongly the ITI activity for each neuron encodes trial history. We obtained an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; × 1 unit vector representing the rank correlation of each neuron and normalized it by its norm to calculate the trial-history mode. Trial-history mode is not orthogonalized to any other modes.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a–c&lt;/a&gt;, we have pooled cells recorded across sessions (that is, pseudo-sessions). For each cell, we randomly selected 50 unperturbed control trials to define the mode. These unperturbed trials met the following criteria: the first lick occurred within 1–3 s after the cue, and there were no licks 3 s before the cue onset. Then, we selected a different set of trials to project the activity along these modes. Only neurons with more than 10 trials within all six lick time ranges were included. The six lick time ranges were: 0.80–1.10 s, 1.10–1.25 s, 1.25–1.40 s, 1.40–1.55 s, 1.55–1.70 s and 1.70–2.00 s.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the square sum of spiking activity explained by individual modes (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we calculated the square sum of the activity along individual modes after subtracting the baseline activity (0–0.2 s before the cue), and then divided that by the square sum of the spike rate across neurons after subtracting the baseline activity. For each lick time range, we averaged across at least 10 trials with lick times within that range, and spiking data for each trial were smoothed using a 200-ms causal boxcar filter. To calculate the square sum of spiking activity explained by the sum of cue mode, middle mode and ramp mode reported in the main text, we calculated the square sum of task-modulated spiking activity explained between 0.2 s from cue (around when task modulation started) to lick for individual lick time ranges and then averaged across them. We calculated the square sum of spiking activity explained by trial-history mode activity similarly but without subtraction of the baseline activity (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a–c&lt;/a&gt;). In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;, we performed a linear regression analysis between trial-history mode activity during 0–1 s before the cue and the upcoming lick time for each iteration of the hierarchical bootstrap. We then plotted the distribution of the linear regression coefficient (slope) across these iterations as a cumulative distribution function.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the angle between activity modes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3m&lt;/a&gt;), we computed the cosine similarity between two vectors of interest. Because cosine similarity depends on vector dimensionality (tending towards orthogonality as the number of neurons increases), we assessed statistical significance by shuffling one of the vectors and recalculating cosine similarity. This allowed us to determine whether the observed alignment between modes exceeded chance levels.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar8"&gt;Single-session analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For analyses based on single sessions (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig10"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig13"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig14"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig16"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig18"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), sessions with more than 300 trials and five neurons were analysed. Spiking activity was binned per 50-ms time window. Activity between 1 s before the cue and the first lick in each trial was analysed (that is, post-lick activity was excluded as we focused on timing dynamics before the first lick). Dimensionality reduction was performed in the same manner as in the pseudo-session analysis, but modes were defined individually for each session. To visualize the time course of activity (for example, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;), trials across sessions were pooled based on lick time, and only lick-time ranges that exist in at least two-thirds of the analysed sessions were shown. Therefore, the plotted lick-time ranges vary depending on the manipulation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To decode the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; from simultaneously recorded neural population activity, we conducted a kNN regression analysis. Within each experimental session, trials were partitioned into two sets: a test set comprising randomly selected 100 unperturbed trials and all perturbed trials, and a training set consisting of the remaining trials. For each moment in a test trial (50-ms window), we searched all time points in the training set to identify &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; data points with the most similar population activity patterns (Mahalanobis distance based on the top principal components explaining 90% of variance). To estimate the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of the test set, we averaged the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; in these kNNs. We tested ‘&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;’ values between 20–50 (which are close to the square root of the number of data points in the training dataset) and found that they yielded similar results and did not change conclusions (data not shown). In the paper, we have reported the results with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 30. Some sessions showed low decodability due to a small number of recorded neurons, trials and/or lack of task-modulated cells (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig10"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). We analysed sessions in which the kNN decodability (Pearson’s correlation between decoded lick time at the perturbation onset time, that is, 0.6 s after the cue versus actual lick time) was higher than 0.35.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To analyse the effect of perturbations systematically, we compared unperturbed versus perturbed trials after matching the number of trials and decoded time at the perturbation onset time (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig13"&gt;7a,c,d,e,g–i,k–m,o,p&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig18"&gt;12e,i&lt;/a&gt;). Specifically, we randomly resampled animals, sessions and trials hierarchically (hierarchical bootstrap; 1,000 iterations). For each perturbed trial in each bootstrap iteration, we identified an unperturbed trial within the same session with the closest decoded time at the perturbation onset time (0.6 s after the cue). Then, we pooled these trials. This procedure allowed us to examine how decoded time (and projection along each mode) changed after the perturbation in conditions where their activity patterns were similar before the perturbation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For the two-dimensional plots (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;) and two-dimensional vector field analysis (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig17"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;), we analysed how activity evolves in the two-dimensional space defined by ramp mode and middle mode. Spiking activity was binned in 50-ms time windows, and activity between the cue and the first lick in each trial was analysed. For each session, we projected the activity of ALM neurons along ramp mode and middle mode. The projection was normalized by the standard deviation of activity among control trials, but was not subtracted by the mean so that 0 represents 0 spike activity. For individual activity state (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) in control trials, we calculated the vector &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{x}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; representing the direction that activity evolves in the next time point (50-ms time bin) in the two-dimensional state. Then, we calculated the mean vector for individual states in the two-dimensional space by averaging all vectors within a spatial bin of 0.5 along both the middle mode and ramp mode axes (if the spatial bin contained more than 30 data points): &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; denote the location of the state along the middle mode and ramp mode axes, respectively. Similarly, we acquired the vector field during inhibition by pooling all time points during inhibition (100–400 ms from the inhibition onset) in photostimulation trials to acquire &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{stim}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then, we calculated the direction between &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{XY}^{\mathrm{stim}}\)&lt;/span&gt; for all states where both control and stim vectors exist. We excluded points where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is within &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\pi /6\)&lt;/span&gt; from tanh(&lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;) because if the activity is evolving against the zero point under control conditions, we cannot distinguish between whether the activity is rewinding or moving towards the zero point during the inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Network models&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a dynamical systems approach, we considered four variables representing the average membrane currents (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) and spike rates (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) is the neural activation function) of neuronal populations in the ALM and striatum. Conceptually, in these models, the striatum represents both connections within the striatum and the subcortical loop via the thalamus, which is why there are excitatory connections. In these models, the membrane potential of neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({h}_{i}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, was governed by the following non-linear differential equation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\tau \frac{{{dh}}_{i}(t)}{{dt}}=-{h}_{i}(t)+\sum {W}_{{ij}}{r}_{j}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${r}_{i}(t)=f({h}_{i}(t))$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; is the membrane time constant (10 ms), &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the element of the connectivity matrix between the presynaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; and the postsynaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the baseline input current, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the external input current, and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the negative current mediated by optogenetics to neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. The membrane current &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({h}_{i}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; was converted to the spike rate by applying a threshold-linear activation function &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) = max(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For integrators mediated by a positive-feedback loop (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), we modelled two neurons in each brain area. The baseline input currents were chosen so that the system displays a stable fixed point at a low spike rate (lower attractor) with a spike rate of 5 spikes per second, consistent with the baseline firing rate observed in the experimental data. The connectivity matrix &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; and the external input &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; are shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. In these models, temporal integration is mediated by a continuous attractor, achieved by having an eigenvalue of 1 in the connectivity matrix. For each area, we defined the ramp mode using the same criteria as in the experimental data, and we then plotted spike rate activity along the ramp mode (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested models with different connectivity matrices reflecting distinct computational roles of the ALM and striatum (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). In the externally driven model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM received a ramping input that scaled with the desired lick times, progressively shifting the location of the fixed point in time. In the distributed model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;), integration was achieved only when interareal connections between the ALM and striatum exist; in the absence of these long-range connections, neither the ALM nor striatum displayed slow-temporal dynamics. Conversely, in the redundant model, the ALM and striatum implemented two identical integrators (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;). Although weakly connected, their behaviour was independent of each other’s input. In the specialized ALM integrator model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM served as the integrator, whereas the striatum followed ALM dynamics. In the specialized ALM leaky integrator model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM integrated the input with substantial leakiness. Although this model replicated the rewinding effect of striatal inhibition, it failed to reproduce the effect of ALM silencing. The model that best matched the neural dynamics observed in our data featured the striatum as a perfect integrator and the ALM as a crucial input region (specialized striatum integrator; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic transient perturbation experiments, the negative current was introduced at 0.6 s after the cue and lasted for 0.6 s, including a 300-ms ramp down. For prolonged perturbations, the negative current was applied throughout the trial without a ramp down. To simulate ALM silencing, both ALM neurons (A1 and A2 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) received a negative current &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; = −10. To stimulate D1-SPN inhibition, we injected a negative current into one of the striatum neurons (S1). To maintain similar perturbation effects on striatal ramp mode activity across different conditions, the negative current for D1-SPN inhibition was varied across models as follows: −0.3, −0.1, −0.1, −0.2, −0.02 and −0.03 for Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1a–f&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate ramping activity with a feedforward network (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;), we used recurrent network modules composed of four or two cells, connected in a feedforward manner. In these models, the recurrent network modules have an architecture similar to that of the feedback model in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, but with weaker recurrent connections (eigenvalue &amp;lt; 1), such that each stage does not function as a perfect integrator. Thus, feedforward connections between stages are essential to amplify the input and generate both ramping and sequential activity. To implement temporal scaling, we provided a global inhibition to neurons in the feedforward network, that is, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, was set to negative. This allows activity to propagate from one neuron to another when the effect of excitatory input exceeds this inhibition. Consequently, the speed of dynamics is controlled by the strength of the step input into the network. The step input is provided to an ALM neuron (except in model &lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;, the striatal integrator model, where it is provided to the STR neuron) in the first recurrent module, allowing it to be amplified by both recurrent and feedforward connections. In addition to the step input, we also provided a transient, cue-like input to both ALM neurons (600-ms duration with 450-ms linear ramp down). This input does not get amplified by the recurrent architecture, as it is provided along an axis orthogonal to the one amplified by the recurrent connections (as in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9a&lt;/a&gt;). This helps to generate a robust cue-related response in the model, similar to the experimental data. The connectivity matrix &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; and input are described in detail in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Transient perturbations were simulated similarly to the positive-feedback network. For ALM complete silencing, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; = −10 was injected into all ALM neurons. To simulate D1-SPN inhibition, a negative current was injected into half of the striatal neurons (s2 and s3; the result did not change regardless of the choice of two inhibited neurons). To maintain similar perturbation effects on striatal ramp mode activity across different conditions, the negative current for D1-SPN inhibition was varied across models as shown in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. For each area, we defined the ramp and other modes using the same criteria as in the experimental data, and we then plotted spike rate activity along these modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramp mode activity was normalized across conditions so that a value of 0 corresponds to the baseline firing rate (5 Hz) of the target neuron (in the positive-feedback model, the target neuron is neuron 3 in all cases, or neuron 4 in the ALM leaky integrator model; in the feedforward model, the target neuron is the ALM neuron in the last recurrent network module), whereas a value of 1 corresponds to the time point when the activity of the target neuron reaches 10 Hz, approximating the activity level just before licking in our data. Thus, the absolute spike rate of the target neuron can be inferred from its activity along the ramp mode, providing a direct mapping between model output and population activity. For the lick time analysis in Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1g&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9e&lt;/a&gt;, the lick time was defined as when the ramp mode activity reached a value of 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample sizes were similar to the sample sizes used in the field. No statistical methods were used to determine the sample size. During spike sorting, experimenters could not tell the trial type and, therefore, were blind to conditions.

			&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/insulin-isnt-just-made-by-the-pancreas-heres-another-location-few-know-about"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; delivery could one day spell an end to the invasive needles on which many people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-key-way-of-consuming-sugar-could-spike-your-diabetes-risk"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; rely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice, minipigs, and lab-grown human skin samples, scientists have demonstrated a topical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-easier-way-to-take-insulin-but-it-hasnt-been-tested-on-people-yet"&gt;insulin treatment&lt;/a&gt; – an achievement long assumed impossible due to the large size of insulin molecules and their strong attraction to water, which prevents them from slipping through the skin's oily outer layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09729-x"&gt;writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists at Zhejiang University in China, "relieving patients with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182252" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery of drugs through the skin has many benefits. It's easy to do at home, is pain-free, and ensures a controlled, gentle release into the body. However, skin is, by design, a barrier that helps protect your body from harmful substances. Its outer barrier, the stratum corneum, consists of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stratum-corneum"&gt;multiple layers of dead skin cells&lt;/a&gt; glued together &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000441540"&gt;by fats and oils&lt;/a&gt;, or lipids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topical drugs work around the skin's defenses; they have small molecules that slip through the skin easily, as well as an ability to interact with the lipids they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin – the hormone that regulates glucose levels – has neither of these properties. The molecules are on the larger side and have a &lt;a href="https://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2005/Dresser/YFPright.html"&gt;water-loving (hydrophilic) exterior&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them chemically incompatible with the skin's oils. Rather than sliding past or through the oils, they bounce off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds impenetrable, but the researchers thought another property of skin may help insulin enter: its acidity. Skin naturally has a pH gradient, starting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2340/0001555574375379"&gt;slightly acidic at the surface&lt;/a&gt; and rising towards pH neutrality in deeper layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set to work engineering a delivery system that would interact with this gradient to admit the insulin as a plus-one to the exclusive body club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is based on a polymer called poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate], or OP, the properties of which change with shifting pH levels, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201300043"&gt;shown to be biocompatible&lt;/a&gt; in earlier tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface of the skin, OP has a positive charge, which allows it to stick to skin lipids. However, at neutral pH, it loses that charge and lets go of the lipids, by which point it has slipped through the skin barrier and into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binding insulin to the OP polymer as a conjugate called OP-1 allows the all-important hormone treatment to hitchhike through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good in theory, right? Well, it sounds even better in practice. In human skin models and diabetic mice, OP-I was more effective at carrying insulin past the skin than insulin alone or insulin combined with a different polymer, PEG, as a control. PEG &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;is widely used&lt;/a&gt; across a range of pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mice, the treatment brought blood glucose concentrations to normal levels within an hour with an efficacy on par with insulin injections. The levels then remained stable for 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was diabetic minipigs, which are biologically more similar to humans than mice are. The effects were comparable. The pigs' blood glucose levels dropped to normal within two hours and also remained stable for 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it gets inside the body, OP–I accumulates in key glucose-regulating tissues, including the liver, fat, and skeletal muscles, where cells take up the conjugate and release the insulin inside. OP-I activates insulin receptors and enhances glucose uptake and metabolism, just like injected insulin does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, it does so in a more sustained manner than injected insulin, resulting in a smoother, more prolonged effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no signs of inflammation, suggesting that the treatment may confer minimal, if any, harmful side effects – although we'd have to wait for stronger human testing to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the results could mean that frequent insulin injections may one day be a thing of the past. And the system may even work with other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The OP conjugation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;, "is versatile for transdermal delivery of biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids, with broad therapeutic applications, warranting further investigation in future studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3742439f-b630-44f6-a55f-6a8b01b29fe8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 35-year-old woman in Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The woman was referred to a hospital following a miscarriage at seven weeks of pregnancy. Leading up to the hospital visit, the woman's gynecologist had decided to check the patient's chromosomes to see if there was an underlying genetic reason for the pregnancy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="3742439f-b630-44f6-a55f-6a8b01b29fe8-2"&gt;The most common karyotype, or chromosomal profile, for a woman is 46,XX. The 46 indicates 23 pairs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in each cell. Two of these are sex chromosomes, which are usually XX for women and XY for men. However, the tests revealed that the patient's karyotype for her blood cells was 46,XY — the typical karyotype for a male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="93f18359-d078-4d4a-b8bd-691da082f3d2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; At the hospital, doctors performed two additional blood tests and ordered more tests to examine other chromosomes in the woman's body. Her skin cell karyotype was 46,XX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors then conducted a physical examination of the patient. Her visible traits were female, and they found no abnormalities in her genitals or reproductive system. Her hormone production was also within the normal range. As an adolescent, her sexual development had been normal, she told the doctors, with regular menstruation that began when she was 13 years old. There were no unusual health incidents in her medical history, and she was the first person in her family to be tested for a potential genetic disorder, the physicians wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452014425001554" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452014425001554" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describing her case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors identified her condition as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chimerism" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chimerism" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chimerism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which the body contains at least two different sets of DNA across different cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can sometimes happen after a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.845490/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.845490/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood transfusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2955429/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2955429/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;organ transplant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which one person receives tissues (and thus DNA) from another individual. But chimerism can also happen naturally, when several fertilized eggs fuse in the uterus to produce a single fetus, or when cells and their DNA are "traded" in the womb. This swap can occur between a mother and an embryo, and sometimes between twins that share the same placenta or whose individual placentas interact in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4fXrfyRTxQtmBzYmv6TnxR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4fXrfyRTxQtmBzYmv6TnxR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in this case had a twin brother. When the doctors analyzed samples from the woman's brother and parents, they found genetic variants in the twin brother's XY blood cells that matched those in the patient's blood. They concluded that during fetal development, the woman had incorporated her twin's DNA into her blood cells while still retaining a different copy of DNA with XX chromosomes in the rest of her body's tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a transfusion process that we call feto-fetal transfusion," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.gmaciel.com.br/en-about/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.gmaciel.com.br/en-about/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gustavo Arantes Rosa Maciel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the report and a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of São Paulo, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/afrique/articles/cdx264g3qw2o" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bbc.com/afrique/articles/cdx264g3qw2o" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BBC News Africa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (translated from French). "At some point, the veins and arteries of the two children became intertwined in the umbilical cord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outcome: &lt;/strong&gt;About 11 months after the patient's miscarriage and after she had completed testing at the hospital, the woman became pregnant again. As a precaution due to her prior miscarriage, the doctors prescribed supplements of the hormone progesterone to be given vaginally during the pregnancy. There were no complications, and she gave birth to a healthy boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;In most cases of people with chimerism involving sex chromosomes, their condition carries substantial physical or reproductive issues. This is the first known example of complete blood chimerism in a woman who otherwise had typical female traits, had no health issues and was able to get pregnant. The case suggests that chimerism in humans is not necessarily a barrier to reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="34ac9136-061a-49cd-add9-3fb1087a9b0e"&gt;This is also the first case in the medical literature of a patient becoming a chimera in the womb via her twin's blood, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And notably, even the karyotyping test for identifying the woman's condition is not commonly performed. It is not part of a standard medical visit. Therefore, it is unknown how common it is for individuals to carry hidden chromosomal anomalies, and incidences of blood chimerism are likely underreported as a result, the authors wrote. Indeed, studies have suggested that other types of chromosomal variations, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/men-with-extra-sex-chromosomes-study" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/men-with-extra-sex-chromosomes-study"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as having extra sex chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are also underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="4c484b4f-721d-4e5f-8be6-5f7fc4e26822"&gt;

The same thing applies to anything in this area, like a cut to the skin, a nose piercing, or even if you pluck or wax your nasal hairs out”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s potential for issues to arise “any time there’s a compromise in the skin in the danger triangle,” she continued – meaning if you break the skin in that area and leave it open to infection, there is some risk of complication due to bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most common culprits? Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus species,” the surgeon explained in her caption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These bacteria live on our skin, but when given an open door, like a squeezed pimple or plucked hair, they can cause swelling, redness, pain, and in rare cases, spread deeper and even reach the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, this could mean a trip to the hospital for antibiotics, “and even incision and drainage”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/danger-triangle" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" in extremely rare cases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691da73be4b06f2a60cab464" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/danger-triangle" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt; in extremely rare cases&lt;/a&gt;, an unmanaged infection in the area can lead to septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, or a dangerous clot in the veins connected to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I remove nasal hair safely?

Erasing “bad” or painful memories and traumatic flashbacks could transform how we treat a wide range of mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have uncovered a promising new strategy: they can actually entice a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;sleeping brain&lt;/a&gt; can lean toward a newer, positive memory when it competes with an older, negative one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work focused on cues and competition. A cue can be a word, place, or smell. When one cue links to two experiences, the brain chooses which memory “wins,” often favoring the newer or more emotional one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this procedure weakened the recall of aversive memories and also increased involuntary intrusions of positive memories,” explained the authors in their study, which is published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2400678121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bad-memories-and-sleep"&gt;Bad memories and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested whether brief reminders played during non-REM sleep could tilt recall toward a newer positive association without broadly &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breathing-coordinates-brain-waves-for-memory-storage-during-sleep/"&gt;weakening memory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan was to help the positive memory win the next time the cue appeared, not to remove the older experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used nonsense words as neutral cues to track exactly which memories competed and when those memories returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy young adults visited the lab over several days. On the first main day, participants learned nonsense words paired with unpleasant pictures – negative but not traumatic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each word became a cue for one specific aversive image. Participants then slept at home so those new negative memories could stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next evening, half the same nonsense words were paired with positive images – animals, infants, and pleasant scenes – creating interference: an older negative association and a newer positive one for those cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bad-memories-and-non-rem-sleep"&gt;Bad memories and non-REM sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second night, during non-REM sleep (monitored by EEG), some nonsense words were played quietly, a stage that supports &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-is-stored-by-spacing-signals-in-other-body-parts-not-just-brain-neurons/"&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants did not wake, but their brains registered the sounds. Each sound reactivated the network tied to that cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every word was played; some served as controls. Items fell into two types: interference items (both positive and negative links) and negative-only items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This let the team test whether sleep cueing broadly harmed negative memories or mainly supported the positive competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, the scientists tested memory for the negative associations. Recall of the old negative image dropped for words that had gained a positive partner and were cued during sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For negative-only words, cueing did not significantly reduce recall. The pattern did not indicate a broad loss; instead, cueing let the positive competitor take the lead more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-interruptions"&gt;Memory interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also measured intrusions – moments when the “wrong” memory intrudes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants tried to retrieve the old negative image, a positive image came to mind more often for cued interference words. In plain terms, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daydreaming-is-linked-to-improved-brain-health-memory-thinking-creativity-mental-functioning/"&gt;positive memory&lt;/a&gt; interrupted the negative one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect did not appear for negative-only words, reinforcing the core claim: cueing favored the competitor; it did not generally suppress negative content in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants saw each cue and quickly judged whether it felt more positive or negative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sleep and cueing, snap judgments shifted more positive for interference items, suggesting a change in the cue’s emotional leaning, not just recalled content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because quick evaluations often guide behavior. If a cue feels less negative at first glance, people may approach it differently the next time they see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-signals-tied-to-bad-memories"&gt;Sleep signals tied to bad memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG recordings linked behavior to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;non-REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, responses in the theta range were associated with stronger positive memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger cue-evoked responses predicted better later recall of the positive images, indicating active replay and reinforcement when the cue was heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This link supports targeted memory reactivation and offers a physiological marker for tuning timing and intensity in future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decision-model-used"&gt;Decision model used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To describe the choice process, the team used a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010224001536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drift-diffusion model&lt;/a&gt;, which treats decisions as evidence accumulating toward one of two options (“positive” or “negative”). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After cueing in sleep, the estimated drift toward the positive boundary increased for interference items – meaning the brain moved faster toward “this feels positive” once a cued word appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model ties choice speed and direction to evidence, these results align with the shifts in recall and quick judgments; cueing altered decision dynamics, not just outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included about three dozen participants who completed behavioral and EEG sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person served as their own control: some words were cued and others were not, and some words had a positive competitor while others did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning and sleep were spread over several days to keep the positive associations newer than the negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-the-study"&gt;Limitations of the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used artificial lab memories under controlled conditions and short time frames. It did not test durability over months or effects on everyday behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work focused on non-REM sleep and did not measure how &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt; might contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These limits matter for interpretation: the findings do not erase or rewrite deeply personal experiences; they show a way to bias retrieval when competing links exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleeping-away-bad-memories"&gt;Sleeping away bad memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach taken in this study aims to shift which memory comes up first during recall, not to erase the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By forming a positive association that competes with an older aversive one and then reactivating the cue during sleep, the positive memory moved ahead in recall, intrusions, and split-second feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With careful development, this could inform strategies for people who struggle with intrusive negative memories, pending clinical tests, longer follow-ups, and attention to ethics and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the takeaway is clear: sleep offers a window when the brain reorganizes memory.

For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: "A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there was still "room for doubt and for clarification from further research".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was "urgently needed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Food and Drink Federation says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines," says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation, which represents industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Current UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:53:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9tbmQ2bngtODhXdmdMWm03Rmk3QWI3NXJUMlVhUjF4ZVEtdnE2WUpOWklTUVd4RmE2RHhTRnlkbnBEWG9kazhiZmg2ZFNlRy1KbWRIamNvRUxZUdIBX0FVX3lxTE42dWdXSU8ycEFsd0RkQ0RfQjZvc0FCU1RteEJqSktTYlYtLUYwZ3dCRjhHdWFvamd1eVFnOFhqM1I2Z0NLUFV3aEx1RWZBa1BBaEVobXdiNkZHdkhreFZ3</guid></item><item><title>Chris Hemsworth的阿尔茨海默氏症纪录片背后的科学-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/science-behind-chris-hemsworth-alzheimer-123000607.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris Hemsworth, right, with his dad Craig on their trip to visit their former family home in Australia's Northern Territory Credit - National Geographic/Craig Parry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When actor Chris Hemsworth, who played Thor in the Marvel series, agreed to join a documentary exploring longevity several years ago, he figured he would learn about how to live better so that he could live longer. But he never anticipated he would find out something that could dramatically affect what those future years could look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the documentary series &lt;em&gt;Limitless&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2022 by &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, Hemsworth took a battery of tests to learn what he could do to extend his healthy years. A genetic test revealed, however, that he has two copies of the risk gene for Alzheimer’s. While the genes aren’t a guarantee he will develop the neurodegenerative disease, carriers have an eight to 10-fold higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diagnosis wasn’t a total surprise; Hemsworth’s grandfather had the condition, and his father Craig is living with it as well. While Hemsworth hasn’t developed any symptoms yet, his father is showing the first signs of memory loss. In a new &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; documentary film called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJtFW5PQ7NU" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Road Trip to Remember;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;A Road Trip to Remember&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, he and his father explore the growing science around potential interventions for the brain disease, and ways that research is showing to slow down its progression. The hope is that these could help people at higher risk stay as healthy and resilient for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since learning of his genetic risk, Hemsworth has made changes to his life, slowing down his acting career to prioritize time with his family, as well as taking steps to keep his body and mind healthy. Sharing his elevated risk status is part of his response to the life-changing news; in a 2022 &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/11/chris-hemsworth-exclusive-interview-alzheimers-limitless" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, he said, “If this is a motivator for people to take better care of themselves and also understand that there are steps you can take—then fantastic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the latest film, Hemsworth focuses on a side of Alzheimer’s care that doesn’t typically receive the spotlight: the role that diet, exercise, sleep, and staying socially active can have on the progression of the disease. Evolving &lt;a href="https://time.com/7306434/daily-routine-cognitive-decline-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that improving nutrition, &lt;a href="https://time.com/7330730/walking-exercise-alzheimers-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercising more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exercising more&lt;/a&gt;, sleeping well, &lt;a href="https://time.com/6986373/how-to-slow-alzheimers-lifestyle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt;, and staying socially engaged can slow the risk of progressing to more advanced stages of Alzheimer’s. In an effort to help his father, Hemsworth zeroes in on social connection and takes a road trip with his father to their former home in the outback of Australia. There, he helps his father reconnect with old friends and reminisce, in hopes of keeping memories from fading away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7333672/laura-carstensen-aging-emotions-longevity-stanford/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Best Years of Your Life Are Probably Still Ahead;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Best Years of Your Life Are Probably Still Ahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The idea for the literal and figurative trip down memory lane came from Suraj Samtani, a psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of New South Wales in the Center for Health Brain Aging, who served as a scientific consultant for the film. Samtani studies so-called social frailty, or the extent to which a lack of social interactions can impact the progression of their disease. It’s not a new concept, but one that is gaining traction in the medical community as a potentially important factor in addressing Alzheimer’s risk as early as possible in the disease course. Combining strategies that involve maintaining or building social connections with Alzheimer’s medications could become a critical way for people like Hemsworth and his father to stay mentally alert for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We knew from previous research that loneliness is as bad for brain health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day,” Samtani tells TIME. “And that social connections are the most important factor in delaying the onset of many chronic health conditions. But we wanted to know: what was the recipe for brain health using social connections? And do social connections still matter after you’ve accounted for all of the other known risk factors of dementia?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Samtani dove into the &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/cheba/research-and-impact/research-projects/sydney-memory-and-ageing-study-mas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sydney Memory and Aging Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sydney Memory and Aging Study&lt;/a&gt;, which includes data on more than 1,300 people, some of whom had brain scans, blood tests, or cognitive tests over a period of 14 years. The participants also provided information on their diet, social connections, and other lifestyle factors. Samtani and his colleagues recorded the number of dementia cases—including Alzheimer’s, the most common form—in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We found that social connections are incredibly protective,” he says of the results, which he and his colleagues &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2666-7568(22)00199-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published in 2022;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. “For people who have good social connections, the risk of dementia was half compared to everyone else,” Samtani says. “That shocked us. We knew these were important but didn’t expect it to be this powerful a protective factor.” Social engagement seemed to “put the brakes on cognitive decline,” he says, for people who had already started experiencing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A year later, they &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.13072" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that not only do people with stronger social connections have a lower risk of developing dementia, but they also have lower overall mortality from any cause compared to those with weaker social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Samtani is now working with an AI bot to mimic the impact that social connections and conversations can have for people with Alzheimer’s—especially those who may be increasingly isolated and without strong networks of friends or family. Called Viv and Friends, the bots connect with people on iPads and are designed to have conversations specifically designed to stimulate the memories of people with dementia. He’s planning to publish the findings from the first small study with 12 older people living in a residential facility who don’t have regular visitors. “Viv is designed to talk to people about lots of different topics in order to stimulate the mind, and also to provide people with emotional support when they feel distressed,” he says. While they are still analyzing the results, he says that one resident who conversed with Viv for five weeks reported that those were the longest conversations she had had in a long while. “The idea is to replace the loneliness people may feel and provide them instead with cognitive stimulation,” says Samtani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why social connections benefit the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are several key features of good social connections, Samtani says. The quality of these relationships matters more than the quantity: People could have an extensive network of social connections but still feel lonely if they’re not getting adequate emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his research, Samtani also identified two factors that seemed to distinguish people with good quality interactions. One was having connections to people outside of friends and family—and outside of the home. That’s because your brain doesn’t have to work as hard when interacting with the people you live with.“You’re talking about a diversity of topics,” which “stimulates the brain and leads to cognitive reserve, or how much capacity the brain has to keep functioning. Sometimes this cognitive reserve can protect from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The second feature of strong interactions is whether a person has someone they can trust and lean on during stressful times. Stress can increase inflammation, particularly in the brain, which can be detrimental and contribute to Alzheimer’s processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One way to build these types of connections is through reminiscence therapy, or reactivating memories of the past. Looking at photo albums and reliving experiences with family or friends can keep memory circuits active and help with retaining cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/collections/time-for-you-menopause/7333401/brain-fog-menopause-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How to Deal With Brain Fog During Menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;How to Deal With Brain Fog During Menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s the approach that Hemsworth takes with his father when they return to Bullman, in Australia’s Northern Territory, a remote town where the family lived when Hemsworth and his brothers were young. “I know for my dad’s cognitive health, going back to Bullman should be powerful therapy,” says Hemsworth in the film. There in the rustic outback, Craig helped to wrangle buffalo, barely dodging their horns, and his fearlessness earned him the nickname “Chuck Norris” in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reactivating old memories forces the brain into a mental workout to revive feelings, smells, sounds, and more, says Samtani, and this process can keep those circuits active and hopefully protect them from more rapid decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Upon returning to Bullman, Craig and Chris reunite with old friends, and as the memories flood in, Craig becomes more animated and engaged. Chris notices that his father becomes more present, although he still experiences brief moments of confusion when he starts talking to an old friend. Samtani says the sense of belonging, trust, and, love is one reason why social connections can help to combat the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemsworth and his father, Craig reminisce about the years that the family lived in Bullman, Australia&lt;span class="copyright"&gt;National Geographic/Craig Parry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the film, Hemsworth says that being back in Bullman is like “pieces of a puzzle” coming together. “I think there was a greater sense of engagement for my dad,” he says of the experience of returning to their former home. “He was much more comfortable and outspoken by the end of this trip than he was at the beginning. Something was ignited in there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is reminiscence therapy at a supercharged level combined with the power of social connections,” Samtani says in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemsworth and his father Craig take part in a spiritual welcome ceremony with an old friend&lt;span class="copyright"&gt;National Geographic/Craig Parry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reawakening old memories and strengthening social ties may be just one potential way to chip away at Alzheimer’s disease, and it highlights the power of intervening as early as possible in the disease to hopefully slow down its relentless progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Following the trip with his father, Hemsworth notes one of the great paradoxes of Alzheimer’s: that the disease gradually robs people of the social connections and bridges that people make with others, but that those very networks are important tools to combat that deterioration. It’s a realization that could help more people like his father, who are in the early stages of the disease, or even like Hemsworth himself, who are at high risk but not yet showing symptoms, to be better prepared to confront the brain changes that could otherwise be so devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20The%20Science%20Behind%20Chris%20Hemsworth%E2%80%99s%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20Documentary&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7335031%2Fchris-hemsworth-alzheimers-documentary%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQdURaT3lQYU9BV2pnSXlLcWJsUGtYenR2T0lFU2dxYm5MYkhBWnlPcjZQZUdhRU1QbFZESzg4eS1TLVBZSUJuZlN5b1kweTlNTHlaZmNOMlpNZWRGWms5dkZoamhUSEZTeGhJR01pY3IyT1hyWXNHSjd4ZHNkTGU3amxQN0xZcEllMEVfdnl1SmNrWXF3R0E</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州现在是全国幼儿园麻疹疫苗接种率最低的地区之一--《星报》</title><link>https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-now-has-one-of-the-nations-lowest-kindergarten-measles-vaccination-rates/601471694</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;Vercel Security Checkpoint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="hide-mobile" data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;|&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;sfo1::1763562901-TMw3WpD2l452rQTSIPJ4ZSvuv3Ylxfec&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNMnd3cFpOUVJLOW1aZ3podXZSQXFkWVFBVHdDYjBBRGJ5SmZOeFpQZnliaFd1dk43OGRTaVVNcDk3UVlLeG0zVFk4MG0ySWhsLUtMUWQxZ2xyXzU2T0V4LXJXcnAwbTRoWGZIRUhOLUFOejhLSlZyYzM5WjJXMC1fdTBUZTEzbEs2VVBhU2docjdIXzJPaHJuYlY2WWkzT25FZ3dPLUJyaU5oeldlc2dyakJYYks2YlhtYmRGYQ</guid></item><item><title>人类在青藏高原上眼前进化- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-are-evolving-in-front-of-our-eyes-on-the-tibetan-plateau</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Humans are not yet done cooking. We're continuing to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;evolve and adjust&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-skin-didnt-always-fear-the-sun-not-until-a-huge-change-10000-years-ago"&gt;the world around us&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/legendary-female-free-divers-reveal-evolution-in-action-on-south-korean-island"&gt;records of our adaptations written in our bodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hanging-wet-washing-up-inside-your-home-could-be-a-health-risk"&gt;some environments can make us unwell&lt;/a&gt;. Mountain climbers often experience &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/altitude-sickness"&gt;altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; – the body's reaction to a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, which means less oxygen is taken in with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, in high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, where &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-drug-mimics-the-health-effects-of-living-at-high-altitude"&gt;oxygen levels in the air people breathe&lt;/a&gt; are notably low, human communities thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthals-may-never-have-truly-gone-extinct-study-reveals"&gt;Neanderthals May Never Have Truly Gone Extinct, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over more than 10,000 years of settlement in the region, the bodies of those living there have changed in ways that allow the inhabitants to make the most of an atmosphere that for most humans would result in not enough oxygen being delivered via blood cells to the body's tissues, a condition known as hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia is fascinating because the stress is severe, experienced equally by everyone at a given altitude, and quantifiable," anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in the US told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a beautiful example of how and why our species has so much biological variation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beall has been studying the human response to hypoxic living conditions &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701985104"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;. In research published in October 2024, she and her team revealed some of the specific adaptations in Tibetan communities: traits that improve the blood's ability to deliver oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To unlock this discovery, the researchers looked into one of the markers of what we call evolutionary fitness: reproductive success. Women who deliver live babies are those who pass on their traits to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traits that maximize an individual's success in a given environment are most likely to be found in women who are able to survive the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141134" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lo Manthang in Nepal, where some of the data was collected.

Those offspring, having inherited survivability traits from their mothers, are also more likely to survive, reproduce, and carry those same traits forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-black-death-shaped-human-evolution-and-were-still-in-its-shadow"&gt;natural selection at work&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be a bit &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mutation-that-helped-ancient-humans-survive-frostbite-also-gave-us-arthritis"&gt;strange and counterintuitive&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-variation-in-blood-type-helps-prevent-the-deadliest-form-of-malaria"&gt;places where malaria is common&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the incidence of sickle cell anemia is high, because it &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00384-9"&gt;involves a gene that protects against malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beall and her team studied 417 women aged 46 to 86 who had lived their entire lives in Nepal at altitudes above 3,500 meters (11,480 feet). The researchers recorded their number of live births – ranging from 0 to 14 per woman, with an average of 5.2 – along with physical and health measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the things they measured were levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein in red blood cells responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues. They also measured how much oxygen was being carried by the hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the women who demonstrated the highest rate of live births had hemoglobin levels that were neither high nor low, but average for the testing group. But the oxygen saturation of their hemoglobin was high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that the adaptations are able to maximize oxygen delivery to cells and tissues &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; thickening the blood – an outcome that would increase stress on the heart as it struggles to pump a higher viscosity fluid more resistant to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141135" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-552x415.jpg 552w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation.

Craig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previously we knew that lower hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that an intermediate value has the highest benefit. We knew that higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that the higher the saturation the more beneficial. The number of live births quantifies the benefits," Beall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was unexpected to find that women can have many live births with low values of some oxygen transport traits if they have favorable values of other oxygen transport traits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lead-exposure-may-have-given-ancient-humans-an-edge-over-neanderthals"&gt;Lead Exposure May Have Given Ancient Humans an Edge Over Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women with the highest reproductive success rate also had a high rate of blood flow into the lungs, and their hearts had wider than average left ventricles, the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, these traits increase the rate of oxygen transport and delivery, enabling the human body to make the most of the low oxygen in the air respired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that cultural factors can play a role, too. Women who start reproducing young and have long marriages seem to have a longer exposure to the possibility of pregnancy, which also increases the number of live births, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even taking that into account, however, the physical traits played a role. Nepalese women with physiologies most similar to women in unstressed, low-altitude environments tended to have the highest rate of reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a case of ongoing natural selection," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Beall said&lt;/a&gt;. "Understanding how populations like these adapt gives us a better grasp of the processes of human evolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403309121"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you get a small cut, you might throw a plastic bandage on it to help it heal faster. However, there are fancier options on the horizon, &lt;a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2025/09/smart-device-ai-bioelectronics-speed-up-wound-healing/" target="_blank"&gt;like this advanced AI-powered smart bandage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a proof-of-concept device called a-Heal, intended for use inside existing commercial bandages for colostomy use. The device is fitted with a small camera, which images the wound site every two hours. The images are then uploaded via a wireless connection, and processed with a machine learning model that has been trained to make suggestions on how to better stimulate the healing process based on the image input. The device can then follow these recommendations, either using electrical stimulation to reduce inflammation in the wound, or supplying fluoxetine to stimulate the growth of healthy tissue. In testing, the device was able to improve the rate of skin coverage over an existing wound compared to a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term goal is to apply the technology in a broader sense to help better treat things like chronic or infected wounds that may have difficulty healing. It’s still at an early stage for now, but it could one day be routine for medical treatment to involve the use of small smart devices to gain a better rolling insight on the treatment of wounds. It’s not the first time we’ve explored innovative methods of wound care; we’ve previously looked at &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/05/18/revisiting-folk-wisdom-for-modern-chronic-wound-care/"&gt;how treatments from the past could better inform how we treat in future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aap.org/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; released its own &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/"&gt;recommendations &lt;/a&gt;differing from the CDC’s new guidelines. The group strongly recommends a COVID vaccine for children ages 6 to 23 months. It also recommends the vaccine be available for children ages 2-18, even if they don’t fall into a risk group, if their parent wants them to have the protection of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YTMKXJIOGVFOROFRRV3K7KZALQ"&gt;Aside from vaccines, Faulkner said there are plenty of other things people can do the prevent their loved ones from contracting a respiratory virus this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LY54OU2XBNBDXA7VXHAKRTQLSA"&gt;Families can prevent the spread of respiratory illness by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__unordered-list"&gt;&lt;li id="FOLKAUEDAVFVPAON4UO2ALNVCQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Practicing good hygiene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="MJJ7CSQH6BHE7EEEGLACR3Y7PI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disinfecting shared spaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="FIXG6XGBSNHCFEZFLQWG55XN3M"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staying home when sick. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="FO2NVZXAUJBETGUT2XUWLFZUDQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoiding large gatherings, especially with a newborn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HZYIUN3UE5HCPAOUPNJUPSBMQY"&gt;“It’s hard.

This is not about drinking more. This is not about energy drinks. This is not about starting coffee if you never drink it. This is about your normal pattern and how your heart responds.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cardiologist noted that some hearts are sensitive to caffeine, while others are not. “Your heart is individual. Your habits should be too,” he stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to the study, “adults treated for AFib who drank a daily cup of coffee were 39 percent less likely to have an irregular heart rhythm episode compared to those who avoided all caffeinated products.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results of the 200-person trial may challenge the common belief that caffeine spurs more abnormal heart rhythms, such as AFib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;However, researchers say it is reasonable for healthcare professionals to allow their AFib patients to try naturally caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee if they enjoy them.&lt;/span&gt; “However, some people may still find that caffeine, including caffeinated coffee, may trigger or worsen their AFib symptoms,” it highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Two years after treatment, the group's glucose levels had significantly decreased, alongside markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-links-gum-disease-with-white-matter-damage-in-the-brain"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Links Gum Disease With White Matter Damage in The Brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high blood sugar level is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;leading risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that root canal treatment doesn't just improve oral health – it may also help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182174" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and endodontologist Sadia Niazi from King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a powerful reminder that oral health is deeply connected to overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182201" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-642x359.png" alt="Root Canal" class="size-medium wp-image-182201" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-642x359.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-1200x672.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-768x430.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-1536x860.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-600x336.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal.png 1926w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182201" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Root canal infections can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, leading to inflammation and potential metabolic consequences. Successful treatment reduces these risks. (&lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study had no control group and was observational, meaning the results can't be used to determine cause and effect, but the team suspects that chronic infections of the tissues in and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-cause-of-alzheimers-might-be-coming-from-within-your-mouth"&gt;around the teeth&lt;/a&gt; may seep into circulation and trigger broader inflammatory changes, affecting the very chemistry of our blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This state of inflammation, in turn, could potentially influence insulin resistance and compromise blood sugar control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That idea needs further testing, but the general premise is supported by emerging evidence linking oral health to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-tooth-loss-linked-to-risk-of-fatal-heart-disease-study-finds"&gt;death and disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increasingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mouth-rinse-could-reveal-early-warning-signs-of-heart-disease"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poor oral hygiene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; can take a toll on the cardiovascular system. In a recent, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;surprising study&lt;/a&gt;, published in September, scientists found oral bacteria in the arterial plaque of those with coronary artery disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034516660509"&gt;&lt;span&gt;some estimates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, people with infectious lesions in and around their teeth may face more than double the risk of developing coronary artery disease down the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To test whether inflammatory markers, driven by oral infections, are linked to metabolic health, researchers turned to patients with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapical_periodontitis"&gt;apical periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (AP) – a chronic inflammatory condition triggered by bacterial invasion into the pulp and root of teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blood samples were taken at five points: before root canal treatment, and then 3 months, 6 months, one year, and 2 years after treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers measured a total of 44 metabolites in the blood, either linked to inflammation or metabolism. Following root canal treatment, just over half of the metabolites had changed significantly, particularly amino acids, glucose, and lipids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after treatment, cholesterol had temporarily dropped. A key amino acid group associated with insulin resistance had also declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvements to blood glucose levels took longer to show up, appearing at the two-year mark. This coincided with a drop in pyruvate, a compound that affects inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If root canal treatment really can resolve cases of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"&gt;hyperglycemia&lt;/a&gt;, researchers think it could potentially mediate an individual's risk of developing serious cardiovascular consequences down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One challenge with measuring metabolites in the blood, however, is that scientists still don't really know how they all function or interact. There are thousands of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt; circulating that can be measured, yet we often only know which health conditions they are associated with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking at just 44 metabolites can only give scientists a snapshot of what is going on, but the results are intriguing enough that the authors are calling for more research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is vital that dental professionals recognize the wider impact of these root canal infections and advocate for early diagnosis and treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also need to move towards integrated care, where dentists and general practitioners work together to monitor the risks through these blood markers and protect overall health. It's time to move beyond the tooth and embrace a truly holistic approach to dental care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07110-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earworm, however, can go only so far in explaining why these drugs are all the rage. Semaglutide (sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy), and related &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; receptor agonists, such as tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound), wouldn’t be as popular as they are if they did not have dramatic results. For example, those who regularly inject themselves with these medications lose, on average, about &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;15 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of their body weight. This has led some commentators to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2023-in-review/the-year-of-ozempic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt; a potential ‘Ozempic revolution’, in which the obesity epidemic – ‘a problem that our high-tech society invented’ – also has a high-tech, pharmaceutical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications mimic glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-017-4289-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; the release of insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; appetite and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877820301769?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine, prolonging satiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drugs also seem to quiet persistent, intrusive thoughts about food (so-called ‘food noise’) and may &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce&lt;/a&gt; cravings in general. Although scientists are just beginning to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-025-00382-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; food noise as a concept, individuals who have taken a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drug often &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that it significantly reduces this distracting, ruminative thinking about food – a near-constant background hum of unwanted food-related thoughts, feelings and desires that may contribute to making poor food choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ozempic and its siblings end up revolutionising the treatment of obesity, it will primarily be through its powerful physiological mechanisms of action. However, when drugs become blockbusters, they can have equally profound indirect effects on public consciousness, changing the way we think about the conditions they are designed to treat. Consider, for example, how the popularity of antidepressants such as Prozac has changed how we think about depression and other mood disorders – helping to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/10/07/did-the-blockbuster-prozac-help-or-hurt-medicine/prozac-reduced-stigma-of-depression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;destigmatise&lt;/a&gt; these illnesses, but also catalysing broader conversations about how personality and the self relate to neurophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this score, GLP-1 medications have yet to live up to their full potential. Or, rather, since the cultural impact of novel medications is determined by our reactions to them, not by the medications themselves, we have yet to live up to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; full potential in reflecting on them and unpacking their implications. (If anything, in our current media environment, the widespread use of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs has reinforced the cultural obsession with being thin.) Thinking carefully about how these medications work can help us develop a more accurate understanding of appetite and self-control – and thereby improve the way we see obesity and people affected &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;by it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;verweight people are often &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0803-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stigmatised&lt;/a&gt; as lazy, with no willpower or self-discipline. On this view, those who want to lose weight should simply try harder to eat well and exercise. When these additional efforts fail, as they &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-024-00551-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; do, overweight individuals might &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223890701331856#d1e314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;feel&lt;/a&gt; shame or guilt. This emotional response can &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/03/news-weight-stigma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exacerbate&lt;/a&gt; unhealthy eating behaviours, discourage people from seeking medical advice, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997407/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;create&lt;/a&gt; a vicious cycle in which weight stigma and weight gain reinforce each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic’s effects on those who use it suggest that weight management may actually have little to do with raw willpower. Taking the drug does not help you lose weight by strengthening your will to overcome cravings for high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods. Rather, it weakens those cravings, and silences ‘food noise’, so that you don’t even need willpower to resist them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, it seems likely that a person’s weight is more strongly determined by the intensity of their desires and appetites than by the strength of their will. If this is right, thinner people shouldn’t be valorised for supposedly being strong-willed, and overweight individuals shouldn’t be disparaged for being weak or feckless. Someone who is overweight may have just as much willpower as a thinner person but need to deploy this willpower against stronger desires for food. In effect, thinner individuals might be getting credit for winning a battle that they never had to fight. As one member of an online weight loss group &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/27/will-the-ozempic-era-change-how-we-think-about-being-fat-and-being-thin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; after taking a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; medication, ‘it is no wonder that skinny people think heavy people have no willpower. Their brains actually do tell them to stop eating. I had no idea.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We do not directly control our appetites; the heart (or stomach, in this case) wants what it wants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get clearer about the effects of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs on self-control by drawing on a distinction between two different ways of acting moderately, which traces back to Aristotle. The first kind of moderate action lines up with how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; people think of self-control: effortfully resisting doing something that you believe you shouldn’t do. The ancient Greek word for this form of moderation is &lt;em&gt;enkrateia&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually translated into English as ‘continence’ (despite its contemporary associations with bladder control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, Ozempic does not seem to make those who take it more continent; it doesn’t help them resist strong temptations to eat more than they think they should. Rather, taking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs brings people closer to the other form of moderation: &lt;em&gt;sophrosyne&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually translated as ‘temperance’. While the continent person experiences many tempting desires and successfully resists them, the temperate person doesn’t face temptations in the first place. A temperate person’s appetites are in perfect harmony with her judgments about what it is best to do. If a temperate person believes that she should eat only a single piece of cheesecake after a big dinner, then she will want only that single piece, and will be satisfied once she’s eaten it, even when faced with a dessert tray full of other delicious treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden

class="pointer-coarse:-inset-4 -inset-1 absolute"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not directly control our appetites; the heart (or stomach, in this case) wants what it wants. Simply deciding to be temperate is not likely to be effective. In part this is because both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2008127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appetite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00261-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415002615%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; are highly heritable: in any given environment, a large fraction of their variance between individuals is attributable to genetics. Although environmental factors – an increase in sedentary lifestyles and greater availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods – explain why average obesity levels have gone up worldwide, genetic &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00414-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; partially explain why some individuals gain more weight than others in these ‘obesogenic’ environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938415300226?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that these gene-by-environment interactions are partly due to the genetically determined differences in appetite. Individuals who inherit a stronger appetite – those who are more responsive to food cues and less sensitive to satiety signals – are simply more susceptible to obesogenic environments. They are more likely to overeat in response to a food environment in which high-calorie, low-nutrient foods are readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory meshes nicely with the idea that &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; medications work in part by moderating appetite and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-024-01460-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; feelings of fullness. If you are not among the lucky few who are naturally temperate with respect to food, taking Ozempic or one of its peers helps you approximate temperance – bringing your appetite into line with your beliefs about what, and how much, you &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;should eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he notion that willpower and resistance are overrated when it comes to weight is backed up by recent research on self-control. Surprisingly, being a highly self-controlled person seems mainly to involve using proactive strategies to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914005339?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/3446/chapter/116770/Of-Marshmallows-and-Moderation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;manage&lt;/a&gt; temptations, rather than being &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-018-9721-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; at directly and effortfully &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/per.1899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resisting&lt;/a&gt; them through sheer willpower. In this way, actual self-controlled humans don’t seem to fit the traditional picture of continence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-controlled individuals don’t fit the traditional conception of temperance, either: their appetites aren’t automatically in agreement with their judgments about what’s best to do. Instead, they take indirect steps to nip potential temptations in the bud. For example, someone who might be tempted to eat an entire chocolate bar at once if they buy one in the grocery store checkout line might avoid this temptation by choosing a register where candy is not displayed, or by distracting themselves from the array of chocolate. Or, if they already have chocolate at home, they might &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40575102?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reframe&lt;/a&gt; how they think about it – say, as a treat reserved for special times – to moderate their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a more accurate &lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Rethinking-Self-Control/Haug/p/book/9781032710082?srsltid=AfmBOooSim6FgaCeBNPr7_p9fKMdI9AkubnG_La2twTtnnJaxKIPRcWZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of self-control reconceives it as flexibly organising our lives so that we are less likely to be in situations where strong temptations arise, and changing our patterns of thought so that the temptations we do encounter are easier to resist. Ozempic and similar drugs are a way of proactively managing temptation, and their effects lend further support to this reconceptualisation of what it means to be self-controlled. The success of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs ought to shift the emphasis away from willpower and continence, revealing these forms of self-regulation to be burdensome and ineffective for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications do not work for everyone and, at least in the US, they are &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/dem/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-launches-investigation-into-outrageously-high-price-of-ozempic-and-wegovy-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt;, which raises concerns about equitable access. Injecting Ozempic may not be a panacea for obesity. But reflecting on why these drugs work, when they do work, can still reinforce valuable &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220941242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lessons&lt;/a&gt; about self-control. It can help us move beyond the myth that highly self-controlled individuals just use superior willpower to inhibit their impulses and cravings. It can remind anyone who has passed judgment on those affected by obesity that simply trying harder to eat differently is not likely to be effective. And it affirms that struggling with one’s weight does not make someone lazier or mentally weaker than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Psyche</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPX2FsT1JqNnNwczN3NUkxV1ZIb1k0UHlQQlBwTmJWS1ZNbWQ3WGV5UldMaDVONlk3MDIwVTZCM0hTRnBPTXh2SUZ3SDZIU203Q3VQZFVKMVhwUWpYZ1dNLWhqWVVlVGZvWDNqM3JTQWFwMWpBQ3NQclNhMmtDMWZQMVFRMmtDTGpKcEJZX21R</guid></item><item><title>奥斯汀集团弹射了一些特朗普的顶级健康顾问-德克萨斯论坛报</title><link>https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/19/austin-brownstone-institute-trump-health-vaccine/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p class="wp-block-custom-everlit-iframe-embed"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="everlit-disclaimer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audio recording is automated for accessibility.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Kulldorff, chair of the Trump administration’s reconstituted CDC vaccine panel, made a shocking — and misleading — statement as the group met in September. Referring to a clinical trial, Kulldorff, a biostatistician and former professor at Harvard Medical School, said eight babies born to women who received Pfizer’s covid vaccine while pregnant had birth defects, compared with two born to unvaccinated women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is very concerning to have a fourfold excess risk of birth defects in these pregnant women,” Kulldorff then said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Scientists criticized Kulldorff’s questions and remarks in that meeting because they suggested that the vaccine caused birth defects, which is &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;not supported by evidence&lt;/a&gt;. The birth defects would have occurred before the women received the vaccine, the scientists said. They say it was one of several scientifically unsubstantiated claims by newly appointed members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an influential panel that guides which vaccines millions of people receive and whether insurance covers their cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the new panel members share a connection to a little-known think tank making its mark in President Donald Trump’s Washington: the Brownstone Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarian author Jeffrey Tucker created the nonprofit institute in 2021, fueled by &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/about/"&gt;backlash against COVID lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; and other pandemic-era policies. “You cannot do something like that to the world and expect people just to sit by and go, ‘OK, that’s normal,’” Tucker said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker &lt;a href="https://fee.org/articles/let-the-kids-work/"&gt;has endorsed child labor&lt;/a&gt;; said of &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1936406697062314256"&gt;COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; that “there is no evidence at all that the vaccines saved millions,” contradicting &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing the opposite; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1971876720190914608"&gt;opposes vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;His institute’s COVID contrarians seek to limit the government’s role in protecting Americans from disease. The Austin, Texas-based think tank &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196172-brownstone-institute-2021-990/#document/p1"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196168-brownstone-institute-2023-990/#document/p1"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196167-brownstone-institute-2024-990/#document/p1"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; from donors whose identities are shielded in tax filings. And in recent months, its associates have catapulted to the highest levels of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least eight people with ties to the Brownstone Institute hold or recently held senior positions at federal health agencies or key roles advising the government, exercising significant authority over access to vaccines and scientific research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, which has been racked by funding cuts and firings under the Trump administration, as well as senior Food and Drug Administration officials Vinay Prasad and Tracy Beth Høeg. Prasad has been involved in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187671/download"&gt;restricting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187542/download?attachment"&gt;the use&lt;/a&gt; of COVID vaccines. Høeg has &lt;a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/cdc-is-endangering-childhood-vaccination-progress"&gt;voiced skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about vaccine mandates and some childhood immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya was a senior scholar for the organization. Brownstone has published &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;Bhattacharya’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/vinay-prasad/"&gt;Prasad’s&lt;/a&gt; writings on its website. Høeg has reported &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;payment&lt;/a&gt; from the group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The institute has &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/"&gt;compensated Kulldorff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/martin-kulldorff/"&gt;published his articles&lt;/a&gt;. Tucker &lt;a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/the-great-barrington-declaration-at-five-years-5924026?utm_source=ref_share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;amp;rs=SHRNCMMW"&gt;wrote in October&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 marked “the beginning of a long friendship” with Kulldorff “that continues to this day.” Three other ACIP members share connections with the organization: MIT operations management professor Retsef Levi, who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-supper-club-west-hartford-september-2025-retsef-levi/"&gt;has spoken&lt;/a&gt; as part of at least one Brownstone event; physician Robert Malone, who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/reclaim-your-independence/"&gt;speaks at its events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/rwmalonemd/"&gt;whose articles appear on its website&lt;/a&gt;; and Case Western Reserve University professor and epidemiologist Catherine Stein, who in 2022 &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;authored an article&lt;/a&gt; calling for an end to vaccine mandates at universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Buckley, a public relations professional who wrote for the institute, accepted a political appointment as a top NIH spokesperson after thousands of workers at the biomedical research agency &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-workers-protest-federal-cuts-bhattacharya-trump-american-health/"&gt;were fired&lt;/a&gt;. Buckley &lt;a href="https://thomas699.substack.com/p/about-the-last-four-years?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;noted on Substack&lt;/a&gt; that his &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/thomas-buckley/"&gt;Brownstone writings&lt;/a&gt; “led to my new job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s maybe his judgment,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckley, when asked to elaborate, said in an email that he interviewed Bhattacharya “for a story that was later published on Brownstone — it was simply me being polite.” He said he resigned from the NIH on Sept. 30. NIH spokesperson Laci Williams declined to confirm his departure date.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite the ascendence of those with ties to his group, Tucker said that “anybody who thinks that somehow Brownstone is some big plot, it’s crazy.” He said he is not in regular contact with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose department oversees the CDC, FDA, and NIH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any influence,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sowing vaccine doubt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with ties to the institute have sown doubt about COVID vaccines or routine childhood immunizations, dismissing widespread evidence that they are safe and the benefits outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’ve successfully placed their ideology inside the mechanism that determines U.S. vaccine policy,” said Jake Scott, a physician at Stanford Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. “It’s very, very troubling.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tucker said that Brownstone “doesn’t have any operational impact on the ACIP committee at all” and that “if somebody wasn’t troubled by Brownstone, there’s probably no reason for us to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker and Brownstone’s associates express libertarian views and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/faucis-lies-are-catching-up-with-him/"&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/cdc-continues-to-torture-the-data/"&gt;distrust of government&lt;/a&gt;, including public health authorities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!” Levi &lt;a href="https://x.com/RetsefL/status/1619945525670981632"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, referring to vaccines based on messenger RNA technology, which Pfizer and Moderna used to develop their COVID shots. &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;Stein wrote&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccine mandates are “unethical” and “not scientifically justified.” Bhattacharya asserted on a podcast with Trump ally Stephen Bannon that mRNA technology for vaccines is &lt;a href="https://omny.fm/shows/real-america-s-voice/the-war-room-with-stephen-k-bannon-ep-4696"&gt;“no longer viable,”&lt;/a&gt; and he has overseen &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf"&gt;mass terminations of NIH grants&lt;/a&gt; for scientific research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy in June fired all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine panel and has replaced them with 12 people so far, including individuals with connections to the Brownstone Institute. Tucker said that he did not propose to the White House or HHS that they be appointed and that Brownstone has not paid them over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During the September ACIP meeting, several new panel members &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-acip-meeting-mmrv-hepatitis-b-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines and dismissed evidence — including the CDC’s own data — demonstrating that they are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included Kulldorff’s questions and remarks about COVID vaccines and birth defects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Pfizer clinical trial, hundreds of pregnant women were given COVID vaccines or a placebo &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04754594?tab=results"&gt;during the second and third trimesters&lt;/a&gt; of pregnancy. But the birth defects &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;Pfizer reported in its clinical study&lt;/a&gt; typically would have formed long before the vaccine was given, said Jeffrey Morris, a biostatistics and public health professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To say that this is a major safety risk,” Morris said, “is beyond a stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“This one really upsets me because it’s just so misleading,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17949"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39574424/"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12529215/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8427483/"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt; between COVID vaccines and miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Kulldorff said: “In the randomized trial, there were four times as many birth defects in children born to mothers receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine during pregnancy compared to the placebo-receiving control group. To ensure vaccine confidence, it is the responsibility of ACIP to note and inquire about such discrepancies, and it is the manufacturer’s responsibility to thoroughly examine it through additional follow-up studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said he is “not affiliated with the Brownstone Institute” but declined to respond to additional questions, including whether he is currently compensated by the organization or has donated to it. The Brownstone Institute paid Kulldorff $108,333 in 2022, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/#document/p1"&gt;tax filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Levi said he heard about the Brownstone Institute from social media. He said he is in contact with Tucker “once in a while” but said Tucker has not advised him on vaccines since he was named to the CDC’s vaccine panel. Levi said he has “never received any compensation,” “never had any affiliation,” and “never donated or given any money” to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya did not respond to questions. Williams, the NIH spokesperson, who had earlier declined to respond, citing the federal government shutdown, did not respond to a query seeking comment after the shutdown ended Nov. 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stein declined to comment and referred questions to HHS. Department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that Stein’s ACIP appointment “reflects the Administration’s commitment to independent, evidence-based science. Her professional record speaks for itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute’s website says &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/donate-to-brownstone-institute/"&gt;it works&lt;/a&gt; “to support writers, lawyers, scientists, economists, and other people of courage who have been professionally purged and displaced during the upheaval of our times.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“There’s a danger associated with a state-imposed orthodoxy,” Tucker said in the interview. “I think Brownstone has a moral obligation to care for dissidents and create settings in which they’re able to test their ideas against people with whom they disagree.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that “there’s never harm that comes from open debate and open distribution of information and views.” But Brownstone’s critics say its associates make extreme claims about vaccines and promote anti-vaccine messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They kind of position themselves as defending freedom, but they consistently platform COVID minimizers and vaccine skeptics,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker took issue with the description, saying “it presumes that we know exactly with scientific precision the severity of COVID, and so anybody who falls short of explaining that with amazing precision is a minimizer.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early September, Scott testified at a Senate subcommittee hearing on vaccines alongside Toby Rogers, a political economist and Brownstone Institute fellow who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/toby-rogers/"&gt;doesn’t list&lt;/a&gt; any medical credentials. Rogers wrote last year &lt;a href="https://tobyrogers.substack.com/p/thinking-points-february-14-2024"&gt;in his Substack newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines are a civilization-destroying technology” and has promoted the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;debunked idea&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines cause autism. “My belief is that the autism and chronic disease epidemics are primarily caused by toxicants — mostly from vaccines and about a dozen additional toxicants,” &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/how-the-corruption-of-science-has-impacted-public-perception-and-policies-regarding-vaccines/"&gt;Rogers said&lt;/a&gt; at the Senate hearing. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;Numerous studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; there is no link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later, members of Kennedy’s handpicked panel of CDC vaccine advisers “spent hours elevating these theories” about vaccines “that are not really based in solid evidence or high-quality studies,” Scott said. “They manufactured doubt about established vaccines, entertained all this speculation without any evidence — that’s the real damage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levi, responding to that criticism, said: “For the first time in a long time we are issuing objective, evidence-based immunization recommendations through ACIP with honest and transparent discussion of the benefits, risks, and uncertainties.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the panel weighed whether to delay the hepatitis B shot given to most newborns, Høeg, a senior adviser for clinical sciences at the FDA, questioned whether the vaccine is safe. “We should have some humility and consider that we may not know all of the potential safety issues,” she said to the CDC panel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;Widespread evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that the hepatitis B newborn dose is safe and that the shot has very few side effects. Starting in 1991, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;the CDC recommended&lt;/a&gt; that the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine be given to infants shortly after birth. The move virtually eliminated the potentially fatal disease among American children. Babies infected with the virus at birth have a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;90% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In academic journals, Høeg has disclosed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving payment&lt;/a&gt; from the Brownstone Institute but did not specify &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;the amount&lt;/a&gt;. She has described Tucker as &lt;a href="https://x.com/tracybethhoeg/status/1545855443578146816?s=61"&gt;“a good friend.”&lt;/a&gt; Høeg did not respond to a request for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an email, the FDA’s Prasad said that he “has received no money from Brownstone or any person(s) affiliated” and that all his content published on its website “was republished from his own personal Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he has not advised Prasad or Høeg on vaccines since they became FDA officials. He described the latest CDC vaccine panel meeting as “a breath of fresh air.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The COVID contrarian clubhouse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute, on its website, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220104034559/https:/brownstone.org/about/"&gt;previously called itself&lt;/a&gt; “the spiritual child of the Great Barrington Declaration,” the controversial pandemic treatise Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, and Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta co-authored in October 2020 that argued against lockdown measures to prevent the virus from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They proposed that widespread immunity against COVID could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected, known as herd immunity, with protective measures instituted for medically vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal was criticized at the time by many public health experts and high-ranking government officials, including then-NIH Director Francis Collins, who called its authors “fringe epidemiologists,” &lt;a href="https://aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FirstCollinsEmail.pdf"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. (Tucker was AIER &lt;a href="https://aier.org/people/jeffrey-a-tucker/"&gt;editorial director&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 to 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been willing to publish articles of some very extreme anti-vaccine people,” Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law-San Francisco focused on vaccine-related legal and policy issues, said of the Brownstone Institute. “They’re trying to give a more respectable veneer to the result of the Great Barrington Declaration,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Tucker said: “I don’t think being an extremist is a good basis on which to shut somebody’s thoughts down. We need provocations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he did not propose that Bhattacharya — who was a senior scholar at the institute and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;wrote 29 articles&lt;/a&gt; from July 2021 through October 2024 — be nominated to lead the NIH. More than one-third of the articles were co-authored with Kulldorff, who became Brownstone’s senior scientific director in November 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff &lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/former-harvard-medical-professor-claims-he-was-fired-for-opposing-covid-lockdowns-vaccine-mandates/"&gt;told National Review&lt;/a&gt; he was fired from the Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham hospital system and placed on leave at the university that month after he refused to be vaccinated against COVID, saying he had natural immunity. Kulldorff said he was &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/harvard-tramples-the-truth"&gt;hospitalized for a COVID infection&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute reported nearly $7.4 million in contributions, grants, and other payments between 2021 and 2024, with about 35% coming from tax-exempt foundations and donor-advised funds, according to an analysis of tax filings. Donor-advised funds allow people to secure tax deductions for anonymous charitable contributions. Tucker said the organization has 17,000 donors, most of them small, but declined to elaborate on funders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filings show the institute has also received funding from foundations run by people with backgrounds in business, including in tech, finance, law, and banking. According to a review of tax records, many of them have also given to anti-vaccine organizations; groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which promoted &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/ivermectin/"&gt;ineffective treatments&lt;/a&gt; for COVID; or prominent organizations in conservative politics, such as the Federalist Society, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Heritage Foundation. Brownstone in 2023 received &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26214557-donors-trust-2023-990/?q=Brownstone&amp;amp;mode=document#document/p56"&gt;$67,350 from Donors Trust Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which funds conservative causes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, the Brownstone Institute’s board included David Stockman, a White House budget chief under President Ronald Reagan; libertarian economist Donald Boudreaux; and Roger Ver, an investor known as “&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;Bitcoin Jesus&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rogerver.com/bio/"&gt;Ver’s website&lt;/a&gt; said he gave more than $1 million to the institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Ver &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;was indicted&lt;/a&gt; by a federal grand jury for allegedly committing tax fraud costing the IRS at least $48 million. On Oct. 14, the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/roger-ver-admits-misconduct-and-enters-deferred-prosecution-agreement"&gt;Justice Department announced&lt;/a&gt; that Ver had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve federal tax charges against him and has paid the IRS nearly $50 million. The government has moved to dismiss the indictment against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘People are very skeptical’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than publishing posts on its website, the institute awards fellowships and convenes conferences and retreats. Its associates testify in front of Congress. And it holds a “Supper Club” series in cities throughout the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The goal of Brownstone is to make possible wide-ranging conversations about the failure of the system and the solutions to it,” Tucker said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Grogg, a registered nurse and founder of Hoosiers for Medical Liberty, spoke at a Supper Club &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-midwest-supper-club-aug-11th-2025-ashley-grogg/"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; on “informed decision-making,” primarily about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are very skeptical,” Grogg said in an interview. “How do we trust people moving forward? Do we really think that we can trust the new leadership that’s coming in to do the right thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she was connected to Brownstone through one of her members. Grogg said she does not think newborns should universally be given the hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth and opposes vaccine mandates. “I don’t want to take anything away from anybody,” but people who refuse to be vaccinated should not be “withheld from society,” Grogg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, as the CDC’s vaccine advisers met, Tucker took to the social media platform X to amplify statements questioning vaccines, including from panel members with ties to the group he created. One was &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1968799366581223763"&gt;Malone saying&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s clear that a significant population in the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Another was from Levi, who, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1969115431345528860"&gt;referring to COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, said, “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence both on safety and efficacy, for not only pregnant women but their babies.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; that mRNA and non-mRNA COVID vaccines are safe for pregnant women. A mother’s vaccination while pregnant &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;also helps protect newborns&lt;/a&gt;. CDC data that drew upon medical records in 12 states found that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;nearly 90% of babies&lt;/a&gt; who were hospitalized with COVID had mothers who did not get the vaccine while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Levi said in an email that “the claim that there is strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of COVID vaccination during pregnancy in the absence of appropriate clinical trials is not consistent with fundamental regulatory principles” and that panel members “were also concerned by the potential safety signal in the single (small) clinical trial that was conducted, and other research.” Malone did not respond to questions for this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff, the ACIP chair, said the panel will review vaccines given during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after the ACIP meeting in Atlanta, Levi gave a Brownstone Institute talk about artificial intelligence systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brownstone was a sponsor this month when Children’s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine nonprofit founded by Kennedy, held its &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/sponsors/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And during the institute’s own annual conference recently in Utah, &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/brownstone-prize-winners-2025/"&gt;Bhattacharya was one of three people&lt;/a&gt; who received its first “Brownstone Prize.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would think it represents a kind of integrity and courage in public life,” Tucker said, “and stand up for what you believe is the truth, even at some degree of personal risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/"&gt;KFF&lt;/a&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

                Doctors note that getting the flu shot is a good way to be prepared for what's feared could be a rough season for the illness.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The signs are, it could be a big season," says &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/webby-lab/webby-lab-team.html" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Webby&lt;/a&gt;, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. "The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere," Webby says. "It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; flu tracker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And H3N2 viruses "tend to be a little bit more problematic," Webby says. "When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers" target="_blank"&gt;Caitlin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. "And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And she says the flu shot this year "may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season," Rivers says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years," Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning "whether vaccines are safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that they are," she says. "And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: "It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The statement added: "The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNMFFscll0d1FHWTJHTVY0SXV5dVRrNzEyXzYzS1llVTBXa1lSbDV4SDd1dHdkS3ViSUgtb2lPcWpzTTdBQ0pKQ25XV2ZwUV9yenlKVkt4OVltUGJybDdNc0xjdFQydWRfYld1VVZKdldfNURvajhCVTB0TXFpT2lXQ2dXM0lobXg0</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织-世界卫生组织（世卫组织）警告，更多国家报告耐药性淋病水平上升</title><link>https://www.who.int/news/item/19-11-2025-more-countries-report-rising-levels-of-drug-resistant-gonorrhoea--warns-who</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted infection, is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, according to new data from its &lt;em&gt;Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP)&lt;/em&gt;, which monitors the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240117297"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; highlights the need to strengthen surveillance, improve diagnostic capacity and ensure equitable access to new treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The release of the new data coincides with  &lt;a href="/campaigns/world-amr-awareness-week/2025"&gt;World Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing the importance of global action against drug-resistant infections.  &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240021341"&gt;EGASP,&lt;/a&gt; launched by WHO in 2015, collects laboratory and clinical data from sentinel sites around the world to track AMR and inform treatment guidelines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This global effort is essential to tracking, preventing, and responding to drug-resistant gonorrhoea and to protecting public health worldwide,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis &amp;amp; STIs. “WHO calls on all countries to address the rising levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and integrate gonorrhoea surveillance into national STI programmes.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2022 and 2024, resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime, the primary antibiotics used to treat gonorrhoea, rose sharply from 0.8% to 5% and from 1.7% to 11% respectively, with resistant strains detected in more countries. Resistance to azithromycin remained stable at 4%, while resistance to ciprofloxacin reached 95%. Cambodia and Viet Nam reported the highest resistance rates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 12 EGASP countries in five WHO regions provided data, an increase from just four countries in 2022. This is a positive development reflecting growing commitment to track and contain drug-resistant infections in countries and regions. The countries- Brazil, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malawi, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Uganda and Viet Nam reported 3615 cases of gonorrhoea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half of all cases of symptomatic gonorrhoea in men (52%) were reported from countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, including the Philippines (28%), Viet Nam (12%), Cambodia (9%) and Indonesia (3%). Countries of the WHO African Region accounted for 28% of cases, followed by countries in the South-East Asia Region (13%, Thailand), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (4%, Qatar) and the Region of the Americas (2%, Brazil).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median patient age was 27 years (range: 12–94). Among cases, 20% were men who have sex with men, and 42% reported multiple sexual partners within the past 30 days. Eight percent reported recent antibiotic use, and 19% had travelled recently.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strengthening and expanding global surveillance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, WHO advanced genomic surveillance, with nearly 3000 samples sequenced from eight countries. Landmark studies on new treatments such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772707625000591" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;zoliflodacin&lt;/a&gt; and gepotidacin, as well as studies on tetracycline resistance, were conducted by WHO’s Collaborating Centre on AMR in STI in Sweden, in coordination with WHO. These are helping guide future gonorrhoea control and doxycycline-based prevention (DoxyPEP) strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EGASP continued to expand its reach in 2024, with Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire and Qatar joining the programme, and India beginning implementation and data reporting starting in 2025 under its National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite notable progress, EGASP faces challenges, including limited funding, incomplete reporting, and gaps in data from women and extragenital sites. WHO calls for urgent investment, particularly in national surveillance systems, to sustain and expand global gonococcal AMR surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I don’t need to wait to get information back and classify you as drug sensitive, this or that regimen. There is no need to go through all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Access to swift diagnostic tests for TB is patchy and it can take days or weeks in some places for doctors to get laboratories to identify the TB type a patient has before they can be helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr William Brumskine, clinical research site leader at the Aurum Institute in Rustenburg, South &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, said he hoped overall care would be improved. “The hope of having a universal regimen that is shorter, that has less side-effects, is you will have less individuals coming in for clinic visits [and so] the health care providers will have more time to give individual care to patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2692e17f-4fc2-463e-8bbc-8152b2e93a56" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Phase-2 trials of a sorfequiline-based regimen at the University of Cape Town Lung Institute.

    &lt;p&gt;Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/messages/pandemic-center-tracking-report-12770578?e=87eb75ed9e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;are surging&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-deaths-us-most-since-2017/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program, who resigned in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/whooping-cough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt;, whooping cough was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;one of the most common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; childhood diseases and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-16-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;major cause of childhood death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;8 in 10 toddlers&lt;/a&gt; had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the COVID pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas logged &lt;a href="https://www.tarrantcountytx.gov/content/dam/main/public-health/han-documents/TCPH_pertussis_HAN_05_25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1,928 pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. By October 2025, the state had &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;exceeded 3,500&lt;/a&gt;. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r704" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;6,600 cases&lt;/a&gt; — four times last year's pace and 25 times 2023's. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn't regional. It's everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key factors behind these numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that &lt;a href="https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/bills/89th-legislature-hb-1586/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;made it easier&lt;/a&gt; for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, "our whole front downstairs area is packed," he said. "We did not see that this year."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. "We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity," he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the COVID and influenza vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to "acellular" ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Babies face the greatest risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-during-pregnancy.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the mother's antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials once promoted "cocooning," vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;no longer widely recommended&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better testing finds more cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589663/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;PCR testing&lt;/a&gt; is also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surv-manual/php/table-of-contents/chapter-10-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;uncovering more pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A growing worry: antibiotic resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors normally treat pertussis with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/antibiotic-resistance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide-resistant pertussis&lt;/a&gt; has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/pregnant-april-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 60%&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts say solutions must match the problem's complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/increase-pertussis-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;issued alerts&lt;/a&gt; in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when COVID funding ended. But staffing is still limited. "There's just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. "We don't have that yet. … It's not real time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the youngest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, COVID, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep sick visitors away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Martin Kulldorff, chair of the Trump administration’s reconstituted CDC vaccine panel, made a shocking — and misleading — statement as the group met in September. Referring to a clinical trial, Kulldorff, a biostatistician and former professor at Harvard Medical School, said eight babies born to women who received Pfizer’s covid vaccine while pregnant had birth defects, compared with two born to unvaccinated women.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“It is very concerning to have a fourfold excess risk of birth defects in these pregnant women,” Kulldorff then said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists criticized Kulldorff’s questions and remarks in that meeting because they suggested that the vaccine caused birth defects, which is &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;not supported by evidence&lt;/a&gt;. The birth defects would have occurred before the women received the vaccine, the scientists said. They say it was one of several scientifically unsubstantiated claims by newly appointed members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an influential panel that guides which vaccines millions of people receive and whether insurance covers their cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the new panel members share a connection to a little-known think tank making its mark in President Donald Trump’s Washington: the Brownstone Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Libertarian author Jeffrey Tucker created the nonprofit institute in 2021, fueled by &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/about/"&gt;backlash against covid lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; and other pandemic-era policies. “You cannot do something like that to the world and expect people just to sit by and go, ‘OK, that’s normal,’” Tucker said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker &lt;a href="https://fee.org/articles/let-the-kids-work/"&gt;has endorsed child labor&lt;/a&gt;; said of &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1936406697062314256"&gt;covid shots&lt;/a&gt; that “there is no evidence at all that the vaccines saved millions,” contradicting &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing the opposite; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1971876720190914608"&gt;opposes vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His institute’s covid contrarians seek to limit the government’s role in protecting Americans from disease. The Austin, Texas-based think tank &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196172-brownstone-institute-2021-990/#document/p1"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196168-brownstone-institute-2023-990/#document/p1"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196167-brownstone-institute-2024-990/#document/p1"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; from donors whose identities are shielded in tax filings. And in recent months, its associates have catapulted to the highest levels of government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least eight people with ties to the Brownstone Institute hold or recently held senior positions at federal health agencies or key roles advising the government, exercising significant authority over access to vaccines and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They include Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, which has been racked by funding cuts and firings under the Trump administration, as well as senior Food and Drug Administration officials Vinay Prasad and Tracy Beth Høeg. Prasad has been involved in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187671/download"&gt;restricting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187542/download?attachment"&gt;the use&lt;/a&gt; of covid vaccines. Høeg has &lt;a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/cdc-is-endangering-childhood-vaccination-progress"&gt;voiced skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about vaccine mandates and some childhood immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya was a senior scholar for the organization. Brownstone has published &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;Bhattacharya’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/vinay-prasad/"&gt;Prasad’s&lt;/a&gt; writings on its website. Høeg has reported &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;payment&lt;/a&gt; from the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The institute has &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/"&gt;compensated Kulldorff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/martin-kulldorff/"&gt;published his articles&lt;/a&gt;. Tucker &lt;a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/the-great-barrington-declaration-at-five-years-5924026?utm_source=ref_share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;amp;rs=SHRNCMMW"&gt;wrote in October&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 marked “the beginning of a long friendship” with Kulldorff “that continues to this day.” Three other ACIP members share connections with the organization: MIT operations management professor Retsef Levi, who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-supper-club-west-hartford-september-2025-retsef-levi/"&gt;has spoken&lt;/a&gt; as part of at least one Brownstone event; physician Robert Malone, who&lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/rwmalonemd/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/reclaim-your-independence/"&gt;speaks at its events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/rwmalonemd/"&gt;whose articles appear on its website&lt;/a&gt;; and Case Western Reserve University professor and epidemiologist Catherine Stein, who in 2022 &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;authored an article&lt;/a&gt; calling for an end to vaccine mandates at universities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas Buckley, a public relations professional who wrote for the institute, accepted a political appointment as a top NIH spokesperson after thousands of workers at the biomedical research agency &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-workers-protest-federal-cuts-bhattacharya-trump-american-health/"&gt;were fired&lt;/a&gt;. Buckley &lt;a href="https://thomas699.substack.com/p/about-the-last-four-years?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;noted on Substack&lt;/a&gt; that his &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/thomas-buckley/"&gt;Brownstone writings&lt;/a&gt; “led to my new job.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s maybe his judgment,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Buckley, when asked to elaborate, said in an email that he interviewed Bhattacharya “for a story that was later published on Brownstone — it was simply me being polite.” He said he resigned from the NIH on Sept. 30. NIH spokesperson Laci Williams declined to confirm his departure date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the ascendence of those with ties to his group, Tucker said that “anybody who thinks that somehow Brownstone is some big plot, it’s crazy.” He said he is not in regular contact with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose department oversees the CDC, FDA, and NIH.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any influence,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sowing Vaccine Doubt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with ties to the institute have sown doubt about covid vaccines or routine childhood immunizations, dismissing widespread evidence that they are safe and the benefits outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve successfully placed their ideology inside the mechanism that determines U.S. vaccine policy,” said Jake Scott, a physician at Stanford Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. “It’s very, very troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said that Brownstone “doesn’t have any operational impact on the ACIP committee at all” and that “if somebody wasn’t troubled by Brownstone, there’s probably no reason for us to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker and Brownstone’s associates express libertarian views and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/faucis-lies-are-catching-up-with-him/"&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/cdc-continues-to-torture-the-data/"&gt;distrust of government&lt;/a&gt;, including public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!” Levi &lt;a href="https://x.com/RetsefL/status/1619945525670981632"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, referring to vaccines based on messenger RNA technology, which Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna used to develop their covid shots. &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;Stein wrote&lt;/a&gt; that covid vaccine mandates are “unethical” and not scientifically justified. Bhattacharya asserted on a podcast with Trump ally Stephen Bannon that mRNA technology for vaccines is “&lt;a href="https://omny.fm/shows/real-america-s-voice/the-war-room-with-stephen-k-bannon-ep-4696"&gt;no longer viable&lt;/a&gt;,” and he has overseen &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf"&gt;mass terminations of NIH grants&lt;/a&gt; for scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy in June fired all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine panel and has replaced them with 12 people so far, including individuals with connections to the Brownstone Institute. Tucker said that he did not propose to the White House or HHS that they be appointed and that Brownstone has not paid them over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the September ACIP meeting, several new panel members &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-acip-meeting-mmrv-hepatitis-b-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines and dismissed evidence — including the CDC’s own data — demonstrating that they are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That included Kulldorff’s questions and remarks about covid vaccines and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Pfizer clinical trial, hundreds of pregnant women were given covid vaccines or a placebo &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04754594?tab=results"&gt;during the second and third trimesters&lt;/a&gt; of pregnancy. But the birth defects &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;Pfizer reported in its clinical study&lt;/a&gt; typically would have formed long before the vaccine was given, said Jeffrey Morris, a biostatistics and public health professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To say that this is a major safety risk,” Morris said, “is beyond a stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one really upsets me because it’s just so misleading,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17949"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39574424/"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12529215/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8427483/"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt; between covid vaccines and miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Kulldorff said: “In the randomized trial, there were four times as many birth defects in children born to mothers receiving the Pfizer covid vaccine during pregnancy compared to the placebo-receiving control group. To ensure vaccine confidence, it is the responsibility of ACIP to note and inquire about such discrepancies, and it is the manufacturer’s responsibility to thoroughly examine it through additional follow-up studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said he is “not affiliated with the Brownstone Institute” but declined to respond to additional questions, including whether he is currently compensated by the organization or has donated to it. The Brownstone Institute paid Kulldorff $108,333 in 2022, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/#document/p1"&gt;tax filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levi said he heard about the Brownstone Institute from social media. He said he is in contact with Tucker “once in a while” but said Tucker has not advised him on vaccines since he was named to the CDC’s vaccine panel. Levi said he has “never received any compensation,” “never had any affiliation,” and “never donated or given any money” to the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya did not respond to questions. Williams, the NIH spokesperson, who had earlier declined to respond, citing the federal government shutdown, did not respond to a query seeking comment after the shutdown ended Nov. 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stein declined to comment and referred questions to HHS. Department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that Stein’s ACIP appointment “reflects the Administration’s commitment to independent, evidence-based science. Her professional record speaks for itself.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute’s website says &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/donate-to-brownstone-institute/"&gt;it works&lt;/a&gt; “to support writers, lawyers, scientists, economists, and other people of courage who have been professionally purged and displaced during the upheaval of our times.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a danger associated with a state-imposed orthodoxy,” Tucker said in the interview. “I think Brownstone has a moral obligation to care for dissidents and create settings in which they’re able to test their ideas against people with whom they disagree.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that “there’s never harm that comes from open debate and open distribution of information and views.” But Brownstone’s critics say its associates make extreme claims about vaccines and promote anti-vaccine messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They kind of position themselves as defending freedom, but they consistently platform covid minimizers and vaccine skeptics,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker took issue with the description, saying “it presumes that we know exactly with scientific precision the severity of covid, and so anybody who falls short of explaining that with amazing precision is a minimizer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early September, Scott testified at a Senate subcommittee hearing on vaccines alongside Toby Rogers, a political economist and Brownstone Institute fellow who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/toby-rogers/"&gt;doesn’t list&lt;/a&gt; any medical credentials. Rogers wrote last year &lt;a href="https://tobyrogers.substack.com/p/thinking-points-february-14-2024"&gt;in his Substack newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines are a civilization-destroying technology” and has promoted the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;debunked idea&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines cause autism. “My belief is that the autism and chronic disease epidemics are primarily caused by toxicants — mostly from vaccines and about a dozen additional toxicants,” &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/how-the-corruption-of-science-has-impacted-public-perception-and-policies-regarding-vaccines/"&gt;Rogers said&lt;/a&gt; at the Senate hearing. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;Numerous studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; there is no link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days later, members of Kennedy’s handpicked panel of CDC vaccine advisers “spent hours elevating these theories” about vaccines “that are not really based in solid evidence or high-quality studies,” Scott said. “They manufactured doubt about established vaccines, entertained all this speculation without any evidence — that’s the real damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levi, responding to that criticism, said: “For the first time in a long time we are issuing objective, evidence-based immunization recommendations through ACIP with honest and transparent discussion of the benefits, risks, and uncertainties.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the panel weighed whether to delay the hepatitis B shot given to most newborns, Høeg, a senior adviser for clinical sciences at the FDA, questioned whether the vaccine is safe. “We should have some humility and consider that we may not know all of the potential safety issues,” she said to the CDC panel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;Widespread evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that the hepatitis B newborn dose is safe and that the shot has very few side effects. Starting in 1991, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;the CDC recommended&lt;/a&gt; that the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine be given to infants shortly after birth. The move virtually eliminated the potentially fatal disease among American children. Babies infected with the virus at birth have a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;90% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In academic journals, Høeg has disclosed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving payment&lt;/a&gt; from the Brownstone Institute but did not specify &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;the amount&lt;/a&gt;. She has described Tucker as “&lt;a href="https://x.com/tracybethhoeg/status/1545855443578146816?s=61"&gt;a good friend&lt;/a&gt;.” Høeg did not respond to a request for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an email, the FDA’s Prasad said that he “has received no money from Brownstone or any person(s) affiliated” and that all his content published on its website “was republished from his own personal Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he has not advised Prasad or Høeg on vaccines since they became FDA officials. He described the latest CDC vaccine panel meeting as “a breath of fresh air.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Covid Contrarian Clubhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-drop-cap is-style-default"&gt;The Brownstone Institute, on its website, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220104034559/https:/brownstone.org/about/"&gt;previously called itself&lt;/a&gt; “the spiritual child of the Great Barrington Declaration,” the controversial pandemic treatise Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, and Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta co-authored in October 2020 that argued against lockdown measures to prevent the covid virus from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They proposed that widespread immunity against covid could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected, known as herd immunity, with protective measures instituted for medically vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposal was criticized at the time by many public health experts and high-ranking government officials, including then-NIH Director Francis Collins, who called its authors “fringe epidemiologists,” &lt;a href="https://aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FirstCollinsEmail.pdf"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. (Tucker was AIER &lt;a href="https://aier.org/people/jeffrey-a-tucker/"&gt;editorial director&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 to 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been willing to publish articles of some very extreme anti-vaccine people,” Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law-San Francisco focused on vaccine-related legal and policy issues, said of the Brownstone Institute. “They’re trying to give a more respectable veneer to the result of the Great Barrington Declaration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Tucker said: “I don’t think being an extremist is a good basis on which to shut somebody’s thoughts down. We need provocations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he did not propose that Bhattacharya — who was a senior scholar at the institute and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;wrote 29 articles&lt;/a&gt; from July 2021 through October 2024 — be nominated to lead the NIH. More than one-third of the articles were co-authored with Kulldorff, who became Brownstone’s senior scientific director in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff &lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/former-harvard-medical-professor-claims-he-was-fired-for-opposing-covid-lockdowns-vaccine-mandates/"&gt;told National Review&lt;/a&gt; he was fired from the Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham hospital system and placed on leave at the university that month after he refused to be vaccinated against covid, saying he had natural immunity. Kulldorff said he was &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/harvard-tramples-the-truth"&gt;hospitalized for a covid infection&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute reported nearly $7.4 million in contributions, grants, and other payments between 2021 and 2024, with about 35% coming from tax-exempt foundations and donor-advised funds, according to an analysis of tax filings. Donor-advised funds allow people to secure tax deductions for anonymous charitable contributions. Tucker said the organization has 17,000 donors, most of them small, but declined to elaborate on funders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The filings show the institute has also received funding from foundations run by people with backgrounds in business, including in tech, finance, law, and banking. According to a review of tax records, many of them have also given to anti-vaccine organizations; groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which promoted &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/ivermectin/"&gt;ineffective treatments&lt;/a&gt; for covid; or prominent organizations in conservative politics, such as the Federalist Society, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Heritage Foundation. Brownstone in 2023 received &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26214557-donors-trust-2023-990/?q=Brownstone&amp;amp;mode=document#document/p56"&gt;$67,350 from Donors Trust Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which funds conservative causes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, the Brownstone Institute’s board included David Stockman, a White House budget chief under President Ronald Reagan; libertarian economist Donald Boudreaux; and Roger Ver, an investor known as “&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;Bitcoin Jesus&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rogerver.com/bio/"&gt;Ver’s website&lt;/a&gt; said he gave more than $1 million to the institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Ver &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;was indicted&lt;/a&gt; by a federal grand jury for allegedly committing tax fraud costing the IRS at least $48 million. On Oct. 14, the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/roger-ver-admits-misconduct-and-enters-deferred-prosecution-agreement"&gt;Justice Department announced&lt;/a&gt; that Ver had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve federal tax charges against him and has paid the IRS nearly $50 million. The government has moved to dismiss the indictment against him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘People Are Very Skeptical’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other than publishing posts on its website, the institute awards fellowships and convenes conferences and retreats. Its associates testify in front of Congress. And it holds a “Supper Club” series in cities throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal of Brownstone is to make possible wide-ranging conversations about the failure of the system and the solutions to it,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashley Grogg, a registered nurse and founder of Hoosiers for Medical Liberty, spoke at a Supper Club &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-midwest-supper-club-aug-11th-2025-ashley-grogg/"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; on “informed decision-making,” primarily about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are very skeptical,” Grogg said in an interview. “How do we trust people moving forward? Do we really think that we can trust the new leadership that’s coming in to do the right thing?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she was connected to Brownstone through one of her members. Grogg said she does not think newborns should universally be given the hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth and opposes vaccine mandates. “I don’t want to take anything away from anybody,” but people who refuse to be vaccinated should not be “withheld from society,” Grogg said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, as the CDC’s vaccine advisers met, Tucker took to the social media platform X to amplify statements questioning vaccines, including from panel members with ties to the group he created. One was &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1968799366581223763"&gt;Malone saying&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s clear that a significant population in the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Another was from Levi, who, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1969115431345528860"&gt;referring to covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, said, “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence both on safety and efficacy for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; that mRNA and non-mRNA covid vaccines are safe for pregnant women. A mother’s vaccination while pregnant &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;also helps protect newborns&lt;/a&gt;. CDC data that drew upon medical records in 12 states found that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;nearly 90% of babies&lt;/a&gt; who were hospitalized with covid had mothers who did not get the vaccine while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Levi said in an email that “the claim that there is strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of covid vaccination during pregnancy in the absence of appropriate clinical trials is not consistent with fundamental regulatory principles” and that panel members “were also concerned by the potential safety signal in the single (small) clinical trial that was conducted, and other research.” Malone did not respond to questions for this article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff, the ACIP chair, said the panel will review vaccines given during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after the ACIP meeting in Atlanta, Levi gave a Brownstone Institute talk about artificial intelligence systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brownstone was a sponsor this month when Children’s Health Defense, &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/sponsors/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a leading anti-vaccine nonprofit founded by Kennedy, held its &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/sponsors/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And during the institute’s own annual conference recently in Utah, &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/brownstone-prize-winners-2025/"&gt;Bhattacharya was one of three people&lt;/a&gt; who received its first “Brownstone Prize.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would think it represents a kind of integrity and courage in public life,” Tucker said, “and stand up for what you believe is the truth, even at some degree of personal risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It does mean that it's not too late to get your flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;There is no one-to-one correlation between cold weather and getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That old adage about stepping outside and catching a cold does not tell the whole story. What does matter is that winter pushes people indoors and into closer contact, making it easier for viruses to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’s National Hospital infectious disease physician Dr. Alexandra Yonts told WTOP that this year’s flu season may arrive later than usual, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will be mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She warned flu cases could start climbing “after Christmas and New Year’s,” when people travel and families gather. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, almost 300 children died from influenza, and most of (them) were previously healthy,” Yonts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one reason the flu shot remains essential is for protecting people with respiratory illnesses, existing health conditions or weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, the flu shot cannot give you the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In common vocabulary, we throw around the term ‘flu’ to mean any sort of viral illness that gives us a fever. But there are hosts of other viruses that are not covered by the influenza vaccine that can still make you sick,” she said. “Protecting you against influenza specifically is still a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonts added that getting vaccinated is especially important before visiting young children, elderly relatives or immunocompromised family members during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Think of it as doing it for those people, if you aren’t interested in doing it just for yourself,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re behind, Yonts said getting both the flu shot and the updated COVID booster at the same visit is completely safe: “That has been studied, and it shows there’s no major difference in the side effects. If anything, you’re getting them both out of the way at once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu shots are recommended for those 6 months old and older, and doctors say it takes about two weeks to build full immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28.

The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We developed a new single-cell sequencing technology that enabled us to directly identify and characterize EBV-infected B cells in lupus patients, and to thereby finally answer that question.” &lt;br&gt;— William Robinson, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, Robinson and his team found that in healthy individuals, there are fewer than 1 in 10,000 of EBV-infected B cells containing a dormant EBV viral genome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, in people with lupus, the number of EBV-infected B cells increased to approximately 1 in 400, which is 25 times higher. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a striking and unexpected result,” Robinson said. “It shows that people with lupus have 25-fold more EBV-infected B cells circulating in their blood than healthy individuals. Even though these cells are rare, in our paper we show that they act as overactive ‘instigators’ of the autoimmune response that mediates lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers also discovered that dormant EBV in a B cell can sometimes create the pro-inflammatory viral protein &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6327052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;EBNA2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data show that EBNA2 — a viral regulatory protein expressed in certain latency phases — can bind and activate genes that induce B cells to become pro-inflammatory and to activate broad autoimmune responses that mediate lupus,” Robinson explained. “EBV also expresses other genes that activate B cells, and these other genes may also contribute to EBV reprogramming B cells to activate the autoimmune responses that mediate lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson said that he believes these findings may lead to more treatments, and possibly a cure, for lupus in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide a mechanistic target: the rare EBV-infected ‘driver’ B cells that activate the autoimmune response that mediates lupus,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of lupus treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic strategies that eliminate these EBV-infected B cells — including next-generation B-cell depletion, engineered cellular therapies, or EBV-directed &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;immunotherapies&lt;/a&gt; — could, in principle, interrupt the root cause rather than only controlling downstream autoimmune inflammation. That makes transformative or curative therapies conceptually possible, though clinical development will take time.” &lt;br&gt;— William Robinson, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the next steps for this research, Robinson said it will include validating this mechanism in larger and longitudinal patient cohorts, and investigating exactly how EBV reprograms autoreactive B cells to mediate systemic autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(Also) determining if &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/car-t-cell-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;CAR T&lt;/a&gt; or other ultra-deep B cell depleting therapies work by depleting EBV+ driver B cells,” he added. “(And) investigating whether the mechanisms identified are active in other autoimmune diseases including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MS (multiple sclerosis)&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://raolab.bwh.harvard.edu/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Deepak Rao, MD, PHD&lt;/a&gt;, the Jonathan S. Coblyn and Michael B. Brenner Endowed Chair in Rheumatology and Immunology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, co-director of the Center for Cellular Profiling at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao commented that this report provides a very exciting mechanistic connection between EBV infection and the pathologic autoimmune response in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have long suspected EBV to be implicated in the development of lupus,” he explained. “This report provides an intriguing mechanism by which EBV may fuel the activation (of) the core autoimmune response in lupus.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is striking that the EBV-infected B cells in patients with lupus are so strongly enriched in one specific B cell population — the ‘age-associated B cell’ phenotype, which is a core player in the autoimmune response in lupus,” Rao continued. “The work provides an impressive demonstration that EBV-infected B cells produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9627499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;autoantibodies&lt;/a&gt;, and that these B cells can activate T cell-B cell interactions to drive production of more autoreactive B cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A link to other autoimmune diseases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work raises an interesting question — would a drug that fully suppresses EBV infection also suppress the pathologic autoimmune response in patients with lupus? Or, if we could effectively vaccinate all children against EBV infection, would this prevent the development of lupus in otherwise susceptible individuals? It will be very interesting to see if a similar pattern exists in other autoimmune diseases — do EBV-infected B cells in other autoimmune diseases, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/233747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sjogren’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, also produce disease-associated autoantibodies?”&lt;br&gt;— Deepak Rao, MD, PHD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 05:06:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQN0c3Ti1xVXpGd0hKREhWZ2s1STZUYXE1SEVENjlsbHFmVl9Uci1oNmFhOFRKSFdodENuS0RReHZINUp0S0ZCdjBibGlXYU9zdlVpSFV6VmRlUFp6blhrWWpONXVtVmp6LUxNcmMwMXI5VlRpVjN2Z3M0b1EyU3Rld3lac0lGWW5fYkttSDI4QVhDamh3ZzhhZFlXd0hGZW10QVdyOTJpNWJhZw</guid></item><item><title>大麻可以帮助您减少饮酒量吗？科学家研究“加州清醒”的工作原理- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5604813/marijuana-drinking-california-sober</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Could smoking pot lead people to drink less alcohol?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an elaborate and provocative experiment, scientists doled out joints and free drinks to see whether this idea — sometimes described as "California sober" — survived scientific scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new research offers some of the strongest data yet suggesting that smoking weed does, at least in the short term, curb how much people drink.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday — and are sure to raise questions about the merits of swapping one of these substances for another, especially given growing concern in the public health field about the popularity of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And the researchers are cautious about making any recommendations based on their findings at this point.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you," says &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jmetrik" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Metrik&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the research does bring scientists closer to understanding the link between these two substances, at a time when many people are leaning on marijuana to cut back on drinking, without waiting for the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature," says &lt;a href="https://health.yorku.ca/health-profiles/?mid=1895430" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Wardell&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at York University. "This gives us more confidence that there's a real effect here."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98340" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting high for science&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Brown study, the team took pains to replicate the real-life circumstances of getting stoned and drinking, while still maintaining a tightly-controlled study that could point toward a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;They constructed a laboratory that resembles a bar, with comfy seats and a tap, and ensured each participant had their preferred alcoholic beverage on hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink," says Metrik, who ended up spending substantial time shuttling between liquor stores looking for special vintages and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiment included three separate sessions. In one of them, participants smoked a marijuana joint with higher levels of the psychoactive compound, THC; in another they used a lower potency strain; and the last, researchers gave them a placebo with a trace amount of THC that wasn't enough to get them high.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After toking up in a designated smoking room, each participant spent the next two hours in the "bar lab" on their own where they had the opportunity to drink up to eight mini drinks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The people who smoked the higher potency cannabis ended up drinking 27% less alcohol, and the lower potency about 19% less, compared to the placebo. People who used cannabis also delayed their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is an important signal that we're detecting," says Metrik. "It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that cannabis may reduce alcohol cravings and how much people drink. But the results have been largely inconclusive, in part because the data often come from observational studies, which are less reliable and can be muddied by other factors. Animal studies have also indicated potential biological mechanisms behind weed's effect on alcohol; however, there's a question of how much this applies to humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new study also builds on what a team of researchers in Colorado &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871625003138" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in a slightly different experiment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There, participants instead picked up their marijuana from a dispensary, smoked it at home and then visited a mobile lab parked nearby, where they were offered alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The amount people ended up drinking dropped by about 25% when they were already stoned. Cravings also went down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These findings are all converging on a similar story," says &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/39978" target="_blank"&gt;Hollis Karoly&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz who led the study. But she points out there are still big questions about how much you can extrapolate from this new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98341" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Replacing one problem with another?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One obvious limitation is that how someone behaves when every sip they are taking is under close observation may not necessarily reflect what happens in a much looser, real-world social setting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And beyond that, Karoly says this pattern toward reduced alcohol consumption wasn't true for everyone in their study. In a minority of people, it actually led them to drink &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This really highlights the fact that individual differences matter," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another unanswered question centers on who's being studied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Brown trial met the criteria for "cannabis use disorder," and about 40% for alcohol use disorder. That could indicate their "drug of choice" was not necessarily alcohol in the first place, says &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rajita-sinha/" target="_blank"&gt;Rajita Sinha&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For people with problem drinking, cannabis &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a potential treatment, she says. This approach, on the other hand, "may also be promoting more cannabis use and that would be problematic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once you're in the throes of daily cannabis use, it's very hard to kick that habit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those involved in this work acknowledge the tension in this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cannabis doesn't carry the same risks of extreme harm as alcohol, which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;is a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of preventable death in the U.S and kills more than 170,000 people a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Wardell says cannabis is clearly "not a harm-free substance," either.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While research on its effect has not kept up with its surging popularity, studies have shown marijuana can impair cognition and memory, trigger a serious gastrointestinal syndrome that causes nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric illness, and impact relationships and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Wardell says this latest study doesn't actually tell us whether the negative outcomes of alcohol are worse than cannabis in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We would have to choose which one for a given individual might be less harmful and make sure that it's not inadvertently just replacing one problem with another," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her role as a clinical psychologist, Metrik at Brown has seen     some patients with severe alcoholism who successfully stopped drinking with the help of cannabis, though some have then gone on to develop issues with that drug.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In her mind, the problem right now is that many people are relying on cannabis to treat their alcohol problems, without any guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We see this all the time, and we don't know what to tell them. There's no clear messaging," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

You learn to tolerate their weird taste in music and their questionable cleaning standards. The shared kitchen, especially, is a delicate ecosystem where everyone has their own way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You respect their space, and they respect yours. But what happens when one person’s &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/health/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;healthy routine&lt;/a&gt; is another person’s trigger? One student’s disciplined diet became the catalyst for a roommate war, forcing a difficult question about personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info: &lt;a

became a tense, silent war zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is set in a classic off-campus housing situation, where a fitness-focused student lives with their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/friends/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; and his new girlfriend. The narrator is a creature of habit, a gym-goer who strictly tracks their macros, weighs their food, and consistently turns down junk food. This disciplined lifestyle, which had never been an issue before, was about to become a major point of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, the new roommate pulled the narrator aside for a serious talk. She revealed that she has an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hey-pandas-share-your-experiences-with-eating-disorders/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and that the narrator’s strict habits were triggering her desire to relapse. She then made a series of requests: that the narrator stop weighing food in front of her and generally be “less strict” with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator’s response was blunt, telling her that while they hoped she was okay, she didn’t have the right to ask them to change their entire &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, and that her ED “isn’t really their problem.” This, predictably, did not go over well. The roommate called them a jerk, and the friend in the middle has chosen the path of a conscientious objector, refusing to take sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the apartment is a cold war zone. The narrator is left wondering if they are the jerk for setting a firm boundary around their own health and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/weird-thing-you-doing-lots/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;habits&lt;/a&gt;, or if they should have compromised their lifestyle to make their roommate more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?image_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="“Am I The Jerk For Telling My Roommate It\'s Not My Problem If I Trigger Their ED?”" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?media_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9674773" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg" alt="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." title="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/couple-looking-desperate-frustrated-stressed-unhappy-annoyed-shouting-screaming_17361152.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;kues1 / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roommate’s request, while difficult, comes from a very real and painful place. As outlined by &lt;a href="https://equip.health/articles/understanding-eds/how-to-avoid-triggering-someone-with-an-eating-disorder" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Equip Health&lt;/a&gt;, specific behaviors like weighing food, strict dieting, and labeling foods as “good” or “bad” are common and powerful triggers for individuals with eating disorders. While the OP’s behaviour wasn’t intentionally triggering, it did push the wrong buttons in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a crucial difference between asking for reasonable accommodations and demanding control over another person’s life. According to Eating Disorder Specialist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/help-my-roommates-living-behaviors-are-triggering" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Kelly Flack&lt;/a&gt;, while the home should be a “safe place,” the person with the ED is ultimately responsible for their own recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasonable request might be, “Could we avoid talking about weight or calories at dinner?” An unreasonable one, which is what happened here, is demanding a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/recording-snooring-roommate/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;roommate&lt;/a&gt; fundamentally change their personal diet and stop their own health practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while the narrator’s delivery was blunt, their refusal to alter their lifestyle was a necessary boundary. As experts at The Emily Program &lt;a href="https://emilyprogram.com/blog/coping-with-triggers-in-eating-disorder-recovery/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;, a key part of eating disorder recovery is learning to develop coping skills to manage triggers, as it is impossible to eliminate them from the world entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree that the roommate needed to learn independent coping skills, or should her demands have been met?

&lt;p&gt;More than 40 experts from around the world published their research in top medical journal The Lancet, blaming UPFs for poor diets globally and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/brazilian-study-links-ultraprocessed-foods-to-early-death/a-72376669"&gt;a rise in diseases&lt;/a&gt;, from obesity to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's about the evidence we have today about … ultra-processed foods and human health," Carlos Monteiro, a lead researcher from University of Sao Paulo, said at an online briefing on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we know right now justifies global public action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Researchers blame food industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that UPFs currently represent more than half of all calories eaten in the United States, Australia and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-unhealthy-are-processed-foods/a-68276757"&gt;blamed massive corporations for changing global diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades by using aggressive marketing to sell products made with inferior ingredients and artificial methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight UPF manufacturers — Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Danone, Fomento Economico Mexicano, Mondelez, and Kraft Heinz — account for 42% of the sector's $1.5 trillion (€1.3 trillion) in assets in 2021, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The key driver of the global rise in UPFs is the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry, and its restructuring of food systems for profitability above all else," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry comprises UPF manufacturers at its core, but also a broader network of co-dependent actors who collectively drive the production, marketing and consumption of UPFs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-73457359" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="73457359" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/69695215_605.webp" data-duration="04:51"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have urged countries to introduce warnings on package labels, restrict marketing and levy taxes on certain UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The politics of food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "Ultra-processed foods" has often been met with some criticism, with some scientists calling it "too simple."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disagreement on UPFs among the scientific community has spurred an intense debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge criticisms in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series, saying more evidence is needed, but they also say the signal is already strong enough for governments to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also argued against criticism of their work on UPFs, saying efforts to "manufacture scientific doubt" on the subject were similar to tactics used by the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/tobacco/t-74329342"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; industry.&lt;/p&gt;
