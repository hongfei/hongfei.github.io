and growing numbers are being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), confirm the wider potential benefits of drug treatment and could help patients decide whether to start medication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Having ADHD means the brain works differently to most other people's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Symptoms can include difficulties concentrating and sitting still, having high energy levels and being impulsive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite the surge in people asking for help, the disorder is not becoming more common. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c720r1pxrx5o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Last year a BBC investigation found long waits for assessment in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People are only diagnosed if the symptoms cause at least a moderate impact on their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most commonly prescribed drugs, called stimulants, help manage everyday symptoms but there has been limited evidence of longer-term benefits for people's behaviour, while well-publicised side-effects, such as headaches, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping, have sparked debate on their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This BMJ study was based on 148,500 people aged six to 64, with ADHD in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some 57% started drug treatment and, of these, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/methylphenidate-adults/side-effects-of-methylphenidate-for-adults/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin)&lt;/a&gt;, was prescribed, to 88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;suicidal behaviour -

Group at Curtin University in Western Australia, said the research demonstrated "the diffuse benefits of ADHD diagnosis and treatment". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Failure to diagnose and treat ADHD can lead to self-medication with alcohol or other drugs, poor mental health, injury, and incarceration," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Too many people with undiagnosed ADHD end up in the criminal justice system, where their condition may remain undiagnosed and untreated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ian Maidment, professor in clinical pharmacy at Aston University, said the study "adds to our understanding of the potential benefits of these drugs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he said the research did not assess whether patients actually took their medication or the impact of different doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the study was not a randomised trial – and so cannot definitively prove that medication caused improved outcomes – it adds to evidence of the substantial value of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We found that ADHD medication was associated with significantly reduced rates of first occurrences of suicidal behaviours, substance misuse, transport accidents and criminality,” said Prof Samuele Cortese, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Southampton. “Our results should inform the debate on the effects and safety of ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After accounting for factors including age, sex, education level, psychiatric diagnoses and medical history, ADHD medication was associated with reduced rates of a first occurrence of four of the five outcomes investigated: a 17% reduction for suicidal behaviour, 15% for substance misuse, 12% for transport accidents and 13% for criminality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="76611298-f5d4-436d-b57c-8f3e6142103a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is well established that ADHD, thought to affect about 5% of children and 2.5% of adults worldwide, is linked to higher rates of mental health problems including suicide, substance misuse and accidental injuries. People with ADHD are also disproportionately represented within the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that for many patients, medication can help alleviate hyperactivity, impulsivity and the inattention. But there has been more limited evidence on whether these improvements translate into benefits in everyday life, at a time when the increasing number of people being diagnosed has fuelled a debate about the possibility of “overdiagnosis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The number of prescriptions being issued in England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/11/adhd-prescriptions-in-england-have-risen-by-18-each-year-since-pandemic#:~:text=ADHD%20prescriptions%20in%20England%20have,deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder%20%7C%20The%20Guardian" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest study, which the researchers say is the largest and most rigorous of its kind, used Swedish national registers from 2007 to 2020 to examine the effects of ADHD drug treatment in 148,581 individuals aged six to 64 years with a new diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team used a technique called target trial emulation, which aims to apply the design principles of a clinical trial to existing medical records through the use of strict inclusion criteria, follow-up timeframes and the use of statistical techniques to compensate for the fact that people were not randomly assigned to “treatment” or “placebo” arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Zheng Chang, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and senior author of the research, said: “It’s now considered one of the most rigorous methods for analysing observational data.

Now we have evidence that medication can reduce this risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Adam Guastella, of the Children’s Hospital Westmead Clinical School at the University of Sydney, said: “Such benefits have been shown repeatedly in previous studies, but the large sample size, use of a national registry, and more sophisticated analysis give greater confidence in these results that findings aren’t explained by something else other than medication use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People should know that if ADHD medications work for them and their child, that there will likely be many other positive impacts on life from treatment. Such effects will not work for everyone and there is still a need to understand why many individuals benefit from ADHD medication and some do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPRi02SXgwYTl0aE8ydDdTMUMtMHhtV0EzZDJZOVBFQVhrdklOUDdfb09lTWdFamRoUHpBdFhrR1NFZjJaRHJxbVpCcHhoQjJvQlFZeEZzVEVSTmRBYWJHZGhPVXJfSVh2bmt6X0xIUWlDRXNTRkF3NkRHMEVsOHNZOWphcFhhblc0WlRmVFVZNlJGZjI3aWpfQUI4amRXMmZzRFNfaFlVZE90VGtmYTB4MkR5cFAzRmpDbVhqcV9oaw</guid></item><item><title>在密苏里州证实可能与滑水有关的罕见脑食变形虫感染- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQV0FpSmlZOGZkQm9ESFFVTUpFWjI0bjdEUWY1MXVHbG04MEg5QU5BbklJMWdXbTBTbmY2NnlRYnVqVllhaWU4cDZHV2NFYUlVYmotQktENFhtTFVNOGVQWUdpbDIySi1QSWRYUE5ONklyYmR3dnRxVmxVU3ZUeUQtVTlTNWRfa2hGUFoxMNIBkgFBVV95cUxPdEkzRkNuMWhveWlQT1pkOGxyOE82cUtpZk11MFJBaW5CT19UMFdQaUliRTljUS15dVJ4WjFuYVZfcks1NGYzTjBaOV91aWlOQkVqZHRGa1JUQzN2NGpSWHhpcWNpaEZKQTJQNGFsMW9pQ2M2TUx3QUlhSHZSeHlBeGo4UF8tenZXTnZieHhHR3hMUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person in Missouri has been hospitalized after contracting a brain-eating amoeba, possibly after water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks, state health officials said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who was not identified, is being treated in an intensive care unit for a confirmed Naegleria fowleri amoeba infection, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said. Public health officials are still investigating the source of the infection, but the health department said the patient became ill days after they were at the lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two public beaches open to visitors at the Lake of the Ozarks State Park, according to the park's website. The health department did not specify which beach the patient had gone to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Naegleria fowleri organism is common in warm freshwater, the infection — called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM — is rare, health officials say. It occurs when water is forced up the nose and is able to cross into the brain, which can happen during &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;recreational freshwater activities&lt;/a&gt;, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1962 and 2024, there have been 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/patient-dies-brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;12-year-old Jaysen Carr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died in South Carolina after getting infected. The South Carolina Department of Public Health said it was the first known case in the state since 2016. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jaysen-carr-south-carolina-brain-eating-amoeba-awareness/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Jaysen Carr's family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later spoke publicly about their son's death, saying they "do not want this to happen to anyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of infection, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; suggests holding your nose or wearing a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into freshwater or keeping your head above water in hot springs. Signs of infection include nausea, vomiting, fever, a severe headache, stiff neck, seizures, altered mental state and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing contaminated water or from someone else who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not really a better way to sum up recent photos and headlines about &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/science/frankenstein-bunnies-with-head-spikes-invade-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cottontail rabbits spotted around Fort Collins&lt;/a&gt; with long, dangling growths on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as concerning as they appear, the virus that causes the dark, wart-like growths is relatively common and usually not anything to worry about, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/tag/colorado-parks-and-wildlife/"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths are caused by &lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/diseases-of-research-animals-dora/rabbits/rabbit-shope-papilloma-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rabbit or shope papilloma virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is spread between cottontail rabbits through direct contact or biting insects such as fleas and ticks, Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shope papilloma virus can’t spread to humans or other pets, although both should avoid rabbits and other wildlife, Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials have received a handful of reports of the virus since &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Denver’s 9News&lt;/a&gt; published a photo and story of the odd virus last week, which spread to dozens of other local, national and international news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waxy papillomas are mostly made up of keratin and don’t have any negative impact on rabbits unless they interfere with their ability to eat or drink, and most rabbits recover from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbit papilloma virus can spread to pet rabbits and is more severe in domestic breeds, so pet owners should seek veterinary treatment if their animal gets sick, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is found in cottontail rabbits, especially during summer months, when there is higher rabbit density and insect activity. While CPW has received around a dozen reports of sightings over the last week, Van Hoose speculates that there probably aren’t that many cases of SPV, but rather, many people are likely seeing the same group of infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no risk of virus transmission to humans or other animals, though the CPW recommends that humans and pets should still stay away from and not interact with infected rabbits if they cross paths. However, the CPW also notes that domestic rabbits, if they are housed outside, could contract the virus from infected insects or rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottontail rabbit with SPV growths, photographed in Minnesota.

A person may be able to spot if this is a problem if they notice the rabbit doesn’t seem able to hop properly, Lindstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you find a dead rabbit on your property, regardless of whether it is visibly infected or not, Lindstrom notes that it is safe to wear gloves and handle the animal yourself if you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:08:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxNend2NnQ0T01GR0JETHNOSDA3Z1dHZUdFa0kxdUVpM2M5UWdxeGF5cG5SaFVPSUYwM1gtek5WOG54OGx5b1dfYVBzOUpubXFPY1dCQmRGaG1yUFRNSy1RaEdBdEhHOU5ua04zaEJsX2FnZXpuTzFTVDdYRUlCMHQ3TEo1UWM2ZDMxZWFqNG0xOXYyT2dzV192cnlJYWxRY2czWmhQYWZRV08tOURIQVpiWEI5ZDFEWVRYQlM1amZES0pYOVBhZ3dsT2FGY096SjNBOHp0Z0dWSUJxQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子说，医生驳回了他患有食管癌的1个迹象- TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNW5XWTBsOXlJR09Edkp0ckRmYnNiNXB2eVdiUmxZRW5mSndlTHpybDU4cHludURQclJfallkaEpCd2dzQnc3d3dTU1JvT09SNGRfX3pBNGZqM0J0OFJsdWlUYm1ua0lSTEZCRURhVWFrYndkYmwxRjdMOHl4aFlRS2o4WVpLSFVfaWfSAVRBVV95cUxQSE1IZ3FQank1cHgzYVpJd21HMEZtcC1KZEpJcE9uQTFnVkh2LWZ2TFcwdTMwQjBGZlQzTzVCVHZkaHU2Q3ZIT0h5d0I5NlY1dHhvbWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84b3b6" class="body-graf"&gt;After three stressful years, Mark Sevillano Jr. felt like his life was falling into place. At the start of 2024, he began working out at the gym three days a week and eating healthier foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d628b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt better and just when I started feeling better, I … couldn’t really swallow my food comfortably,” the 41-year-old from Santa Fe Springs, California, tells TODAY.com. “I felt like it almost would get stuck in my throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-224efc" class="body-graf"&gt;He’d “chug” water, and that often helped the food move through his esophagus. After two months, his symptoms worsened, and he visited a doctor, who reluctantly ordered a swallow test for Sevillano. Before he could undergo the exam, he visited the emergency room, where he learned he had esophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8096b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have never imagined that I had any cancer, let alone esophageal cancer,” he says. “I’ve never even said the word esophagus. It was not on my radar at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5eed91" class="body-heading"&gt;Transformation Leads to Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c242c" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2021, Sevillano's 11-year marriage ended in divorce, and the dad of two was stressed. At the same time, he was in college completing his teaching degree. By 2024, he had graduated from college and finally began to feel settled as he regularly attended the gym, ate healthy foods and ran a few 5Ks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d472f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“'I’m healing,'” he recalls thinking. “I was losing a little bit of weight, but I thought it was because of my new lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-013643" class="body-graf"&gt;Soon after, his swallowing problems began. At first, drinking a lot of water helped. But after two months, swallowing became even more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79db28" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have to literally pound my chest with my fist to help break down the pathway to allow my food to go down,” Sevillano explains. “That was so odd now that I think back on it. But at the time I thought, ‘Oh, I need a little extra help to digest my food.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-3226a1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2198"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

But his primary care doctor “didn’t sound too concerned” because Sevillano was young and there was no family history of cancer. Still, Sevillano asked for a swallow test — which his mother, who is a nurse — told him to request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f197f" class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘We’ll schedule a swallow test in the future. I’m not too worried about it,’” Sevillano recalls. “Looking back on it, I was like, ‘Wow, there are so many red flags.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478db3" class="body-graf"&gt;He scheduled the appointment for several months later. But his swallowing “got progressively worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32444d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I couldn’t even swallow liquid anymore,” he says. “It would sit in my throat, almost like a drain that is clogged up, and it’s filling up with water. You need to unplug the drain. It felt like that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b66a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano visited the emergency room and, at first, the doctors were “perplexed” by his swallowing difficulties. But they conducted bloodwork and even had him undergo a CT scan. At about 4 a.m., his blood test results returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384f1b" class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) said, ‘Hey, to let you know your bloodwork came back great and the next thing we’re waiting on is your scan, and I’m sure that’s going to come back great as well,’” Sevillano recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98e5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;Less than an hour later, the doctor returned with a grim look on his face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0800c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He said, ‘Unfortunately, we got your scan back and we found a mass in the center of your chest, in your lower part of your esophagus,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24277" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, he didn’t realize doctors sometimes interchangeably use mass and tumor, so he wasn’t too worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If he would have said, ‘You have a tumor,’ I would have freaked out a little more,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e4a6b" class="body-graf"&gt;He stayed in the hospital to undergo tests, including a biopsy. But when doctors attempted it, they struggled to pass the scope through all the inflammation in his throat. Though they tried a smaller scope, the sample they removed wasn’t enough to determine if it was cancerous. Still, they released Sevillano from the hospital, and he ran a 5K two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-399ccd" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano's doctors scheduled a second biopsy. But before that happened, he became very ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-501a5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“(This) is where I almost died,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22fcb5" class="body-graf"&gt;As he waited for the new biopsy and maintained a liquid-only diet, Sevillano became tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf6dd" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body just didn’t feel right,” he says. “I started to feel light-headed, almost as if I’m going to faint.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c647a" class="body-graf"&gt;He rested on the couch and began “convulsing,” and “shaking and shivering.” After he put on a coat and a hat to warm himself up, his mom noticed he was too pale. They returned to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed him with sepsis, a potentially fatal overreaction in the body to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70055a" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body was shutting down and they had to pump me with any type of antibiotics to fight the infection that was rapidly going through my bloodstream,” Sevillano says. “For the next four days, I was fighting and trying to get the infection out of my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6625b5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1708"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

For the most part, chemotherapy caused exhaustion, brain fog and some neuropathy, but after the fourth round, he “started actually vomiting black stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1820a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was still awful,” he says. “I took it like a champ. But I think it could have been worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad08db" class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery took place in October and was intense. Doctors removed six inches of his esophagus, which is about 10 inches long in total, and a strawberry-sized tumor. Doctors used his upper intestine to create a new esophagus connected to his remaining organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-002461" class="body-graf"&gt;“I went in with a smile on my face and said, ‘OK, let’s do this. Let’s take this tumor out,’” Sevillano says. “When I woke up, I had maybe eight tubes in my side, in my face. I was in severe pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-135236" class="body-graf"&gt;After recovering in the hospital for several days and undergoing more tests, Sevillano returned home. About a month later, he underwent one more round of chemotherapy. Doctors recommended that he have another three, but he felt overwhelmed by his prior chemotherapy and treatment and elected to stop. Since his surgery, there has been no evidence of disease. He will undergo regular scans for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fdd406" class="body-graf"&gt;“I had my six-month check-up scan and that came out with no detection of cancer,” he says. “I went to the beach and celebrated six months of being cancer-free.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-be8da9" class="body-heading"&gt;An Increase in GI Cancers in Young People &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a38087" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano is part of a trend of young people being diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers, which include colorectal, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal cancers. These diagnoses are increasing faster than any other type of cancer in adults under 50, according to a review published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2836671" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46c06a" class="body-graf"&gt;While colorectal cancer cases in young people have increased the most, pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancer diagnoses are also on the rise, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gastrointestinal-cancers-are-rising-dramatically-people-50-rcna219104" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The latter three do not have a screening test like colorectal cancer does, making them harder to diagnose early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2730a5" class="body-graf"&gt;While more research is needed, the cause of all gastrointestinal cancer in young adults could be the same. Researchers suspect causes include having a sedentary lifestyle, being obese, smoking, drinking alcohol and eating an unhealthy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79d1af" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as an adult, Kimmie Ng, co-author of the paper and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-5b1177"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-04-0df3cb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-04-0df3cb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-04-0df3cb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-04-0df3cb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-04-0df3cb.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

Much like Sevillano’s doctor dismissed his early concerns about swallowing, many young people find their doctors downplaying their concerns because they’re not considering gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50. That could contribute to diagnosis in later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89df83" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeing is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey, told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c81391" class="body-graf"&gt;Though Ng said it’s possible that GI cancers in younger people “may be biologically different and more aggressive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a02dd2" class="body-heading"&gt;‘My Spirit is Not Broken’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf32" class="body-graf"&gt;After so many months of not being able to eat normally, Sevillano still struggles with getting enough nutrition.

The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention estimates that there are 80,000 yearly cases of the vibriosis in the United States, with 52,000 coming from eating contaminated seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most vibrio infections lead to mild gastroenteritis. Vibrio vulnificus is the variant with the high mortality rate tracked by the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wound and bloodstream infections of vibrio vulnificus have the severe symptoms, with the bacteria killing one in five people who are infected.

It also was the Florida's fifth death related to the bacteria this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;So far in 2025, 16 people have contracted vibrio vulnificus across the state. In just Northwest Florida, there was one case in Okaloosa County, one case in Walton County, and two cases in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How are most cases contracted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When infections do occur, they typically come from eating raw seafood infected with the virus, or entering water with an open wound. Exposing a wound to raw seafood, such as when shucking an oyster, can also cause an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sanitary sewer overflows, leaky septic tanks, heavy rains, and disturbance of underwater sediment are also linked to higher concentrations of vibrio vulnificus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Rising surface water temperatures from climate change also might allow the bacteria to become more prevalent in colder climates. Cases have been found as far north as New York and Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus thrives in water temperatures between 68 and 95, but can grow in temperatures up to 105, according to the FDOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Panama City News Herald</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQRTk1U1BoallqbDBieE5Ob0xhUVYta2JZNHA3MEtmS0JuNFRlM25iNlZYSUZmSTlKNGpWSHJCZkhJMUhnWUM1OG5aeWlIaWEwQ01jeW0tN2RQV1V6Nng1NExZQ092X1Rrc3JnMXFyLTl3NUhJWE5jb1lwSFBQMExkWUVvUzVjdFp4bXdvMGxCbmM3cG4wNW9PQzhLNlF4M2hKSXhNazdFWXBpSzdEcGFjYlptSlltV1dkRi1LQ1lKSGdNUEhKZmdRNzVhUWhCdw</guid></item><item><title>在Ozarks湖之旅后在密苏里州居民中发现的大脑食用变形虫- KSDK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxOemoxRHVVY3M0NXR5ZHNKbGg0QlA1UzVPRk5JUmdhTml6MTM3SnJraDZSMnYzWHlndUltMFI5R0JQN1FzSlRxQkt1aUxfT29ETndsTGpDcW9mN25zM29DUkgtRkhyMVA1RzlLay1VV2F5SXAtRGxxMGMtLWtxT0ItMFBvaFFFMlZIVk1Jd1k1cmx0d0FESkl4aTQzZlVBcHY1ekFRNUt6TGdubTV5aUhIQm5URC1aUzZVRFN2YXQxNFlPUXdRUHR1dTM2S3RUakNoaWo2ZmFWdFBsNm5SNTdva3B6aFFOWC1Ea0dQTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The deadly infection has been historically rare, but as climate change heats up waters and worsens flooding, research shows cases could become more common.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — A Missouri resident is in intensive care after officials confirmed they had contracted a rare and deadly infection after swimming at the Lake of the Ozarks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services confirmed the swimmer was infected with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Naegleria fowleri,&lt;/a&gt; commonly known as a brain-eating amoeba. The amoeba can cause a deadly infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is naturally present in warm freshwater and is often found during the summer months, but human infection has historically been extremely rare, health department officials said. There have only been 167 reported cases of the infection in the United States between 1962 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time a Naegleria fowleri infection was &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/ea19a071-5c03-495c-9b62-69db69078d4e/missouri-dhss-confirms-case-of-rare-brain-infection#:~:text=Naegleria%2520fowleri%2520is%2520a%2520microscopic,care%2520unit%2520of%2520a%2520hospital." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;confirmed in Missouri was in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The only other confirmed case in the state was in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The source of the patient’s exposure is currently being investigated by public health officials," officials said. "While not confirmed, preliminary information implies the patient may have been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days prior to becoming ill. Recreational water users should assume that &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is present in warm freshwater across the United States; however, infection remains very rare."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other suspected cases of PAM are being investigated in Missouri at this time, according to the department. 5 On Your Side reached out to the Centers for Disease Control for additional comment, but it deferred to Missouri health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Naegleria fowleri infections have historically been rare, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; warns that warming temperatures and increasingly frequent floods caused by human-induced climate change are making infections occur more often.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, which is outside the livable range of competing microorganisms, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; research published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in the waterways through flooding, creating the perfect storm for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The company was developing an RNAi-based therapeutic for H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu. RNAi is short for RNA interference and refers to small pieces of RNA that can shut down the production of specific proteins. The approach has been well studied, and several RNAi-based drugs are on the market. The first was approved in 2018 to treat nerve damage caused by a rare disease called hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The contract cancellation came as a surprise to Tiba, which received a stop-work order on August 5 that did not reference the wind-down of BARDA’s mRNA vaccine development activities. “Our project does not involve the development of an mRNA product and is a therapeutic rather than a vaccine,” said Jasdave Chahal, Tiba’s chief scientific officer, via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Government contracts often include specific milestones that contractors must achieve to receive funding and move forward with their projects. Tiba says its project had met its goals so far and was near completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Also among the canceled contracts was a $750,000 award to Emory University to convert an mRNA-based antiviral treatment for flu and Covid into an inhaled, dry powder formulation. The project did not involve the development of a vaccine. “Unfortunately, we don’t have much insight to offer on the grant cancellation,” Emory spokesperson Brian Katzowitz told WIRED in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The cuts are consistent with Kennedy’s desire to deprioritize research into infectious diseases, although &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493544/rfk-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;experts have warned&lt;/a&gt; that the cuts could leave the US more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Despite its scaling down of RNA-related infectious disease research, the administration has expressed enthusiasm about some non-Covid research involving mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In January, shortly after taking office, President Trump announced a joint venture by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank called Stargate to invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure. At the time, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison talked up the potential for AI to make personalized mRNA-based vaccines for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In an &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/"}' href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;August 12 op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in The Washington Post, National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya acknowledged the promise of mRNA. “I do not dispute its potential. In the future, it may yet deliver breakthroughs in treating diseases such as cancer, and HHS is continuing to invest in ongoing research on applications in oncology and other complex diseases,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Unlike his boss, Bhattacharya says he does not believe the mRNA vaccines have caused mass harm. But he says the reason for stopping mRNA vaccine research is because the platform has lost public trust—a rationale that deviates from Kennedy’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Yet mRNA may be more accepted when it comes to treating very sick patients with genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Earlier this year, regulators at the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-baby-received-a-custom-crispr-treatment-in-record-time/"&gt;greenlit a customized gene-editing treatment&lt;/a&gt; for an infant named KJ Muldoon with a rare and life-threatening liver disease. Created in just six months, it uses mRNA to deliver the gene-editing components to his liver. It was the first time a customized gene-editing treatment was used to successfully treat a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In June, FDA commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/interactive-and-social-media/fda-direct-podcast"&gt;praised the achievement&lt;/a&gt;

said: 'Binge gaming may signify an initial phase in the progression of IDG and other severe social, physical and mental health issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added other risk factors may lead to the development of the disorder like attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study has revealed binge gaming is linked to poor mental health in children and teens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, the latest government figures show 91 per cent of children and young people between three and 15 years old play video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gaming disorder has even been labeled as a health condition by the World Health Organization (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, a study found that teens who spend more than two hours a day scrolling on phones or tablets doubled their risk of developing anxiety and quadrupled their chances of becoming depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged screen time, particularly passively scrolling or ‘doomscrolling’, led to heightened anxiety, depression, aggression and impulsiveness among adolescents who took part in a nine-month study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroscientists said 45 per cent of the 12 to 17-year-olds they studied, who had no prior mental health conditions, experienced psychiatric symptoms that needed further medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research comes amid a growing mental health crisis in Britain’s schools, with NHS data showing more than a fifth of eight to 16-year-olds had a probable mental health problem in 2023, a rise of 7 per cent since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13972829/video-games-better-workout-mind-exercise-research-shows.html"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have found that video gaming can have benefits—with one claiming it can be a better workout for the mind than physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, researchers found gamers scored better on memory, attention and reasoning compared to those who did not play video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged screen time led to heightened anxiety (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile moderate-level exercise of 150 minutes per week, in line with NHS guidelines, didn't boost memory and thinking skills, despite improving memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13757513/Playing-video-games-BENEFITS-mental-health.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;with 97,000 participants found the often misunderstood hobby, gaming, had a positive impact on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Japanese researchers revealed owning a game console and playing games helped participants improve their wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, participants who played video games for over three hours a day did not enjoy the same benefits, which suggests the problem may lie in binge gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in one study, researchers found those who played video games for three or more benefits a day performed better in cognitive and memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They undergo multiple rounds of manufacturing, with factories infusing cheeses, cured meat, potato chips and more with additives that would never be found in the average household kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-056570a0-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report recently revealed that Americans get &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14977481/americans-half-diet-cancer-causing-foods-report.html"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their daily calories on average from highly processed foods. Kids and teens got about two-thirds of their calories from these foods from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF-heavy diets have been linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;a laundry list of maladies&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-05665b01-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05665b00-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined in April that for every 10 percent more ultra-processed food added to a person's diet, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14655757/researchers-reveal-number-americans-killed-ultraprocessed-foods-us.html"&gt;risk of dying early&lt;/a&gt; from any cause jumped by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They further found that one in seven of nearly 1 million premature deaths in the US could be tied directly to ultra-processed foods like meats, candy, ice cream, and even some seemingly healthy salads and breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are the same. Some UPFs, like frozen veggies, canned tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and Greek yogurt, are healthy swaps because their processing, including freezing and canning, preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part of the appeal of UPFs is their accessibility. They are generally cheaper than unprocessed chicken, fresh fruit, and organic vegetables. They help families keep their grocery costs down and get dinner on the table quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts argue that families do not have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for convenience. Canned low-sodium beans, frozen vegetables, and breads with a short ingredients label can be swapped out for some less-than-healthy pantry and freezer staples packed with sodium and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Foods like pepperoni, chicken nuggets, syrup-packed canned fruit, frozen dinners, candy, store-bought breads, chips, and ice cream are classic ‘red flag’ ultra-processed foods—packed with additives, excess sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPFs are difficult to avoid in the average American grocery store. They make up about 70 percent of the inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a study out last week: ‘Most of the foods containing industrial additives are also high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although the additives are part of the issue, the main problem is that children and adults in the United States eat excessive amounts of nutritionally poor UPFs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term ‘ultra-processed foods’ is an umbrella term that encompasses those items that have been pumped with preservatives, artificial colors, filler ingredients, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, not all UPFs are harmful,’ the AHA added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads are of better diet quality, have been associated with improved health outcomes, and are affordable, allowing possible inclusion in diets.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being ultra-processed, some of the best swaps for what most would consider 'junk food' contain fewer additives, including preservatives and colors, less added sugar, and lower sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen veggies and berries, canned tomatoes, whole grain bread, and unsweetened Greek yogurt all qualify as processed foods because they undergo innocuous, and in some cases beneficial, processes. These include flash-freezing, canning, mechanical straining in the case of yogurt, and enrichment with vitamins in whole grain bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-7eaeb250-786a-11f0-ad6d-4bfd60e95792"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freezing vegetables preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45vFm1t"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain low-sugar yogurts have been associated with improved health outcomes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45Nnoc5"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UPFs typically have long ingredients list including hard-to-pronounce chemicals, artificial colors, and added sugars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows percentages of calories consumed from ultra-processed foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, most UPFs on store shelves also contain more saturated fat, sodium, and sugar, all red flag ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cured and processed meats such as pepperoni and chicken nuggets, canned fruits in syrup, frozen meals, candies and some breads, potato chips, ice cream, and more, are examples of ‘red flag’ foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options,’ the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists recommend people swap out red flag foods with UPFs that include beneficial ingredients like whole grains, beans, yogurt, or nuts, as well as fortified cereals, whole-grain breads, or plain yogurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have been linked to better heart health compared to UPFs loaded with synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grain breads are full of fiber that reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Beans and nuts serve as the ideal protein-packed snacks, and unsweetened yogurt balances the body’s gut microbiome and improves overall gastrointestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grace Derocha, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.realsimple.com/ultra-processed-foods-that-are-actually-healthy-11788918"&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The science recognizes the complexity—UPF is a broad category, and context matters. We should differentiate between 'unhealthy UPFs' and more wholesome packaged items.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a dozen countries have officially advised against letting UPFs dominate one’s diet. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some, like cities in Brazil have eliminated UPFs from foods served in schools while others, such as Colombia, tax them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The EU, UK, Canada, and several Asian countries have outright banned certain ingredients that were recently prohibited in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US has not established a formal definition of UPFs for regulatory purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts at the AHA worry that establishing one that is overly broad could backfire, leading to the vast majority of foods in grocery stores being slapped with a label that warns they are highly-processed, confusing customers to the point of ignoring the warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Food policy reform must consider the broader goals of the food system, including nutrition security, safety, and sustainability,’ the AHA said. ‘Although transformation of the food system is complex, it is achievable.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Wyoming are sinking their teeth into a meaty task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 200 people who stayed in a hotel in Grand Teton National Park between May and July may have unknowingly been exposed to rabies, &lt;a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/health/2025-08-12/wyoming-health-department-tracking-down-more-than-200-after-mass-rabies-exposure"&gt;according to Wyoming Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildlife-and-rabies.htm"&gt;an announcement on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the National Park Service reported finding evidence of a bat colony in the attic. The discovery was made after there had been at least eight incidents in which guests encountered winged mammals inside the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Wyoming Health Department is trying to contact all guests who stayed in a block of rooms under the bat's lair. Specifically, they're reaching out to the over 200 who stayed in rooms 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, and 530 at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May 15 and July 27. It was on July 27 that the eighth bat run-in occurred and the hotel closed the eight rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although there were a lot of people exposed in this incident, one positive about it is that we know who 100 percent of those people are," Travis Riddell, director of the Teton County Public Health Department, told Wyoming Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, bats are one of the two main carriers of rabies, the other being skunks. But bats are of particular concern because—unlike an extremely obvious skunk attack—people might not be aware of bat exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inconspicuous risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabies virus generally transmits through saliva via bites and scratches, and bat bites and scratches are easy to miss. The most common bat in Wyoming is the small brown bat, which weighs less than half an ounce on average—though they can look larger due to their wide wings. These teeny bats, with their wee teeth, can leave bites and scratches that are not visible, do not bleed, and are not painful.&lt;/p&gt;

The condition can be managed with regular doses of synthetic insulin, but there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b1cbb62c-60c0-4c46-8f85-845f8b10b0d6"&gt;Islet cell transplants can provide a longer-term supply of insulin for people with type 1 diabetes. However, after receiving a transplant, the patient’s immune system can recognize the new organ as a foreign object, triggering a response that can destroy the transplanted tissue. As a result, transplant patients must take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, which leaves them susceptible to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these hurdles, scientists in Sweden and the United States transplanted islet cells from a donor's pancreas that had been genetically modified using &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to suppress rejection by the recipient's immune system. This is the first time the treatment has been tested on a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/crispr-will-provide-cures-for-genetic-diseases-that-were-incurable-before-says-renowned-biochemist-virginijus-siksnys" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/crispr-will-provide-cures-for-genetic-diseases-that-were-incurable-before-says-renowned-biochemist-virginijus-siksnys"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR 'will provide cures for genetic diseases that were incurable before,' says renowned biochemist Virginijus Šikšnys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve weeks after receiving the genetically-modified cells, the transplant recipient has continued to produce insulin without an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-35NeBdNxRZMDZK4Hk4PjjC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-35NeBdNxRZMDZK4Hk4PjjC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the authors wrote that their study, although preliminary, suggested that genetically engineering transplant cells to evade the recipient's immune system was a valuable tool for avoiding rejection of new cells or organs by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new approach, the researchers used CRISPR to create three changes to the genetic code of the donated cells so that they were less likely to have an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of these edits reduced the levels of proteins on the surface of the cells that signal to our white blood cells about whether a cell is foreign or not. A third edit boosted production of a protein that discourages attack from other immune cells called CD47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f7f3f0dd-8d98-4cca-9f08-d651dd2b1913"&gt;The genetically edited cells were then injected into the man’s forearm. His body left the modified cells alone and the surviving cells produced insulin as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the man was given a low dose of the edited cells and will still require daily insulin treatment, the case suggests that the procedure can be done safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ next step is to carry out follow-up studies to find out whether the cells can survive in the long-term, which would make management of the disease easier and potentially provide a cure. They also need to do further tests to determine whether the approach works in other patients.&lt;/p&gt;

They looked at hospital and doctor visits. They used the &lt;a href="https://www.maelstrom-research.org/study/bcms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;British Columbia MS clinical database&lt;/a&gt; to learn when participants first had MS symptoms. Researchers also had access to data on filled prescriptions and population data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to look at data from 2,038 participants with MS, as well as a matched cohort of 10,182 participants who did not have MS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking at the doctor visit rates each year in the 25 years prior to MS onset, researchers honed in on the 15 years before. This was when changes in health care visits started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 15 years before MS onset, researchers identified more visits from MS participants for ill-defined signs and symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the 14 years before MS onset, researchers identified an increase in doctor visits, doctor visits related to mental health, and injury-related visits. The elevation in mental health visits was significant for most of the 14 years prior to MS onset, with the exception of years 7, 5, and 4. Overall, mental health visits were up 76%. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years before MS onset, there started to be an increase in psychiatric visits, and this remained significant except in years 6 to 8, and year 4 before MS onset. Overall, the increase in psychiatric consultations was 159%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ophthalmology visits were increased 9 years before MS onset, except at year 6 and year 2, with the highest increase the year right before MS onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the 8 years before MS continued to be high prior to MS onset except at year 7 and year 5. The greatest spike was in the year right before MS onset. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visits for musculoskeletal-related problems were increased in the five years before MS onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At year four and in the year leading up to MS onset, there was also an increase in visits for nervous system conditions, with a greater increase in the year before MS onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visits to the emergency room were greater 5 years before MS onset, radiology increased 3 years before, and internal medicine and neurosurgery increased one year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many healthcare visit upticks peaked in the year right before MS onset. For example, doctor visits and visits for injury, ill-defined signs and symptoms, sensory-organ concerns, and musculoskeletal-related problems peaked in the year before MS onset. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of visits were affected in specific years. For example, endocrine visits increased in year 9 prior to the onset of MS. At the same time, visits related to pregnancy and childbirth decreased to a significant level in years 2 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain conditions also had distinct increases prior to MS onset. For example, researchers observed increases in anxiety and depression at years 4, 3 and 2. In the 2 years before MS onset, there was an increase in problems like dizziness and vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year before MS onset, there was an increase in migraines and specific eye problems, such as retinal detachment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data supports the idea that MS may start much sooner than experts previously believed and indicates the need for more research. The authors suggest that psychiatric and mental health concerns may be early features of the prodromal phase of MS, because these concerns started years before increases in visits related to the nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research did allow for extensive follow-up, there are still limitations. First of all, researchers did not have data on some clinical information details. Instead, they had information on why participants sought out health care services. Second, there is some risk for misclassification or miscoding based on the data researchers used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges of determining MS symptom onset, and researchers note that this “may be influenced by recall bias and challenges with medical history taking.” Some participants had a claim for a demyelinating event or MS before the date designated as the “MS symptom onset date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible there were some cases of MS that doctors could have diagnosed earlier. It’s also possible that participants in the matched cohort had MS, in spite of evidence against this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data focused on people with MS in British Columbia, Canada, and the majority of participants with MS were female, limiting generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, researchers did not collect data on race or ethnicity, so more data specifying this could be helpful. They only corrected for some factors in the statistical analysis, which could have impacted the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zeydan-burcu-m-d/bio-20200696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Burcu Zeydan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at Mayo Clinic, who was not involved in this research noted the following cautions to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see that healthcare visits in the ‘pre-MS diagnosis’ period are mainly for rather nonspecific and/or common causes such as headaches, fatigue, and mental health issues. Since most of these individuals will never develop MS, identification of individuals in a possible MS prodrome carries the risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment as well as a concern for causing unnecessary distress for individuals and families. There is also a possibility of missed opportunities for earlier recognition of MS by clinicians, which is supported by the rise in ophthalmology and neurology visits in the current study as pointed out by the authors. These should be considered in evaluating the MS prodrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research implies that MS starts earlier and delves into deeper questions about what may cause the condition. Study author Professor &lt;a href="https://tremlettsmsresearchexplained.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Helen Tremlett&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, in the Faculty of Medicine (Neurology) at the University of British Columbia, Canada, explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MS may start earlier than we previously thought, and that is actually really important when we think about what causes MS… Our findings suggest we need to look back much further in time than we do, perhaps currently, to avoid thinking that something might cause MS, when, in actual fact, the disease has already started… There’s potential here in the future, not currently, to recognize and perhaps diagnose and manage MS earlier than we can do currently, with the view of course of preventing or slowing progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeydan noted that, “using the observations related to MS prodrome, [researchers] should aim to develop individual-level risk models, possibly a scoring system to reliably identify individuals that are at high risk for developing MS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biomarkers (blood and imaging) would be the key to this effort,” she told us. “Perhaps age and sex differences and tools such as AI can help finetune MS risk prediction models,” Zeydan further hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a potential future multimodal biomarker panel, if people at high risk can be effectively identified in the MS prodrome, individualized disease screening methods can be implemented into MS care for these high-risk individuals,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:27:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNUWYwSFJ4RlZ1cGxmNXNiNjVDY0kwQ3pDbXpPd2NmbGRVblR0Z1poLTJ5QUxnbG1CVllvUjVOT19RMnc1UmJhS1NPOG9kd21nQWVuRXRVN0lnYkRCd2I4bDJlUnMxOTJVR3hEYVNOS0RSYmFLbXhWYnNMYnc1QVlZR2tIdzRmdjVGdG5yMHYzNGFyNWxvNjFwYU1XZG55bmEtOFZONUZGQ05wUQ</guid></item><item><title>性忠告：我妻子总是用她的“病情”来摆脱性生活。嗯，现在我知道真相了。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBPYTBCLWJPSDh6OHNQMnlManNoM2pUSl9SLVRLVEpVQ3ZhX3h0WmYxZ2lIRWJncnFCS1pLSXFybjhBLURNSmZIcW91MnhmdjhwZENuWEVoY2pOV0tJSVpYVW1hUUpWenMwLXVQYlZpcWZkY1ZrQ0UwYU1B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sgyy00123b79fkicuxxb@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for 14 years. When we first got together, she said she had a certain condition, but was in remission at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea6ekcn003l3b79kzscre4n@published"&gt;She suffered from inflammatory bowel syndrome. Over the years, she has had periodic flare-ups during which we abstained from sexual activity. However, last week, I learned that all these years she has feigned having the illness to have an excuse to avoid sex with me.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh0e00133b79qc8pxwrl@published"&gt;The proof came when I arrived home from work early and found that she had been eating tortilla chips with hot salsa (she had previously claimed to be unable to eat anything spicy due to her “illness”). When I demanded to know why she had lied to me all this time, her excuse was that she thought it was the only way I would respect her wishes if she wasn’t feeling up to having sex. It really hurts to think that she would feel the need to stage this elaborate ruse because she automatically didn’t think I’d respect her right not to have sex if she didn’t want to. Now I don’t know whether I even want to continue being married to her. Is it possible to get over this sort of deception?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh4s00163b795mpkw69t@published"&gt;Ah, yes, the old reveal-via-salsa. It’s practically a plot device at this point. Look, the fact of your wife’s deception is understandably upsetting, but I don’t think you’re going to get anywhere without empathy. You need to invest in the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. Why did your wife feel that she needed an excuse to get out of sex with you? Is she generally indirect and non-confrontational? Is there anything you’ve done or in your general tone that could have informed her wariness of giving it to you straight? Did something in her past, perhaps another partner, make her hesitant to turn anyone down for sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh6800173b79dpkbikcz@published"&gt;Don’t take this so personally. Use it as an opportunity to investigate and get to know your wife on a deeper level. Look beyond the principle of her deception to the root causes. You can immediately tell her that she doesn’t need to invent excuses to refuse sex—she can turn you down at any time, and that’s OK (which absolutely should be the truth, by the way). It seems unlikely that she would devise such a ruse for sport. Involve yourself in the reasons behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

            I know that casual sex and the hookup culture are often considered the norm in college, and many students don’t consider negative consequences beyond pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea1hfpe00003b6nzv2axnnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, nearly half (48.2%) of the 2.4 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis (all stages) in the United States in the most recent year surveyed were among adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001a3b6nkwn2e39d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What I’ve seen in my clinical experience is that teens and young adults often overlook the need for protection against infections, especially when they are using birth control pills or IUDs to prevent pregnancy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring 2024 National College Health Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data shows that only half (50.2%) of the students   who used any method of contraception reported using a male condom the last time they had vaginal intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001b3b6nko8rkegy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a college health doctor, I’m aware that many college students are having sex, and that is clearly their choice. But I’ve seen firsthand how emotionally and physically devastating these diagnoses can be, with tears flooding the exam room from students diagnosed with herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital warts or HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001c3b6nuw2ddin7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether the disease is curable or chronic, the emotional toll is often greater than the physical symptoms — especially since many of these sexually transmitted infections could have been prevented.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001d3b6na8eb2jy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why I want you to know what’s really going on in college and what you can do to keep yourself safe and healthy. This is the no-judgment, real-world talk that everyone deserves to hear before swiping right in college — or anywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001f3b6noqubf17l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, don’t believe everything you hear in your dorm, at the dining hall or at keg-fueled parties. While students will hear that “everyone” is hooking up, that’s not true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001g3b6n5l6kud8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 52% percent of college students reported having vaginal intercourse within the last year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 American College Health Association National College Health Assessment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That means 48% did not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001i3b6n1lvole45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s not all consensual sex. True consent is clear, enthusiastic, ongoing, verbalized, freely given and able to be withdrawn at any time. Students often feel pressured to be more physically intimate to fit in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001h3b6n5mzyogt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirteen percent of undergrads report “nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association of American Universities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Intoxicated or high individuals cannot give consent, yet many hookups happen under the influence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001j3b6n4gfw0n17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many students have tearfully shared that they “just wanted to get it over with” or chose oral or anal sex to stay a “technical virgin.” Some feel guilt or regret, while others are fully comfortable with their physical intimacy but are shocked by an STI or pregnancy diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001l3b6njjgytuje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a student comes in concerned about a genital rash, blisters, discharge or pain with urination, STI testing is part of the workup. Students often are selective about which STI tests they want; they’re often fine with checking for chlamydia and gonorrhea but decline HIV testing, because their partner is “not that kind of person.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001m3b6nekc2lykd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the myth persists that these diseases are passed around in other communities (not yours), sexually transmitted infections don’t discriminate. Your risk of an STI comes from behavioral choices, not anyone’s appearance, skin color, culture, religion, values, wealth, sexual orientation or political persuasion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001n3b6njqre91ls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, some STIs are more common in certain populations. But check your bias anyway, especially with HIV. Heterosexual contact accounted for 22% of new HIV infections in the United States in 2022, and 13- to 24-year-olds made up 20% of new HIV diagnoses, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV.gov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a federal website with information and resources related to HIV/AIDS from the US government. Additionally, young adults are increasingly more fluid in their sexuality, which includes having more bisexual experiences, whether or not they identify as gay or bisexual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001o3b6nzafzvvb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you test positive for one STI, you need more testing. Sexually transmitted infections are mostly spread through body fluids, and some are simply shared through direct contact. If you’ve contracted one infection, you may have another, so you should be tested for them. Unfortunately, we frequently diagnose more than one at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001q3b6n0gfdle28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Did you know your partner’s cold sore can become your genital herpes? Cold sores are caused by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex virus type 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or HSV-1, which is easily transmitted by direct contact from one person’s oral area to another person’s genitals. While herpes is probably the most common disease we see passed via oral sex, it’s not the only one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001r3b6ndga6lp48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes and less commonly, HIV, can all be spread bidirectionally from oral-genital intimacy. That means STIs can also cause throat, genital and anal infections. Barriers such as condoms or dental dams can significantly reduce your risk. (This is why flavored condoms exist.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001t3b6np5o5v6uq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most STIs are silent, causing no, fleeting or minimal symptoms, yet capable of causing significant disease in you or your partner. Screening tests are critical to detect asymptomatic bacterial infections early while they can still be easily treated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001u3b6nnh4nvo2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chlamydia-infection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan American Health Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Chlamydia is also the most common bacterial STI in the United States, with more than 1.5 million reported cases per year, and yet chlamydia causes no obvious symptoms in &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/news_items/7437-signs-of-chlamydia-and-what-to-do-next" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (75% of females and 50% of males, according to Scripps Health). Left untreated, &lt;a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% to 15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of women will develop pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, and roughly 10% of those women with PID develop infertility, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial STI, with more than 600.000 cases in the United States in 2023, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Overview of STIs in 2023.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although gonorrhea can also cause PID, very often there is a coinfection with chlamydia, ranging from 10% to 40% in some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261441/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gonorrhea’s biggest challenge is its growing resistance to antibiotics, making it increasingly difficult to treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001w3b6n365kdllw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PID is the most common preventable cause of female infertility in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 women per year, &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt; noted&lt;/strong&gt;. Sexually active young women should proactively get tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea each year to protect their future fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001x3b6nauyzujwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Human papillomavirus is the most common STI overall. Although most HPV infections will resolve spontaneously without problems, persistent infections can quickly cause genital warts or, years later, lead to cancer. Because HPV may be transmitted to a person performing oral sex, HPV also causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/oropharyngeal-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60% to 70%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the roughly 60,000 oropharyngeal cancers (twice as common in men versus women) diagnosed annually in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001z3b6n9tm73ugd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Human papillomavirus genital warts are not lethal, but they will make you miserable. The treatment is painful, with repeated procedures and a high risk of recurrence. Patients are often scared, embarrassed and emotionally distraught, terrified that this incurable disease will make them undesirable to any future potential partners. I cannot emphasize enough how this emotional burden (which we see with herpes and HIV as well) critically affects students’ self-image, confidence and mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00203b6n116iwdin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the HPV vaccine rollout, HPV high-risk infections (including genital warts) have fallen by up to 88% among teen girls and young women, thanks to both direct immunization and herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccination-impact/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00213b6ndcnhamy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with genital warts used to fill our college clinics, and now thankfully are significantly less common. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Impact Monitoring Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  shows that cervical precancers dropped &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roughly 80%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in women ages 20 to 24, and researchers predict HPV vaccination can prevent over 90% of all HPV-related cancers from ever developing, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html#:~:text=recommended%20screening%20test.-,Recommendations,child's%20doctor%20about%20HPV%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00243b6n4fnhk3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re going to have sex, be prepared before you have sex. Birth control pills are extremely effective when used correctly, but college life is filled with irregular schedules, late nights, road trip weekends and, for some people — vomiting. If pills are delayed, forgotten, missed or thrown up, the efficacy plummets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00253b6nf3p5emud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adding condoms not only decreases your risk of conception but also adds protection against STIs. Do not, however, double up on condoms. This myth is still perpetuated, but using two condoms at once can increase your risk of breakage and failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00263b6na7cw5t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Numbers also matter. If you never drive or ride in a car, you’ll never have a car accident. The more you drive, the higher your cumulative risk. It’s math, not morality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00283b6n7tyzb26m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teens and young adults deserve more than outdated, awkward and judgmental sex talks. They need to learn how to protect their health, their future fertility and their emotional well-being while learning to live life as adults. If more students knew this information, far fewer would end up blindsided in their college medical center’s exam rooms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Hookups may be part of college culture for many students, but let’s normalize being open, prepared and honest about the risks. Check with your university health center to learn more about prevention, screening and treatment.

Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, are being spotted with eerie black-colored growths resembling tentacles or &lt;a href="/topic/horns"&gt;horns&lt;/a&gt; protruding from their heads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9NEWS Northern Colorado reporter Amanda Gilbert captured &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661"&gt;a photo&lt;/a&gt; of one not-so-cute rabbit with the growth on its head, which resident Susan Mansfield said looked like “black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t.

A relative of human papillomavirus, SPV is not harmful to humans, pets or other wildlife, and usually doesn’t hurt the rabbit unless it affects the eyes or mouth, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits. Most wild rabbits manage well, as the growths often disappear on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabbits’ eerie look has gone viral, with comparisons to “&lt;a href="/topic/zombies"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;,” “aliens, and “Frankenstein bunnies.” Their antler-like growths may have inspired the North American jackalope legend, some researchers and folklorists say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kEhyLN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11386"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Clinton Forry via Flickr, CC-by-2.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wow, I kinda feel bad for them,” one person commented on an &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNR0agaND8l/?img_index=1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; of the affected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One time I need this to be AI,” another joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zombies are on the rise,” someone else added on &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/complex/posts/1267866944979693"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rabbit escaped from ‘Monty Python and The Holy Grail,’” another person referenced the cult-classic movie’s killer rabbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOMDRjUHJ2aE4zb3d4M1pDR1dsUnQ0ejlIZnF3MjlmWlo1Y2hXY0dMQ2stS3lzbGpqR1l2ZnRseElvWS1NOHpROFhJNHFuN216aE9OOEVpdkp6Z0tTSkVsWkNlTWtQeUY3SWV1ZlJxZ3NONWZvZE5odVZDS0Rzem1qS29laHd5bG5VNVUwUXoxaFJmZmdMUW41Zm1WTUZEQkE</guid></item><item><title>全国范围内的自然实验将建筑环境与体育活动联系起来-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE96TlM5bk1JN1hLNlZSeWJxX1F1RE82ajhaV0RFRVhTTF9IbjRkcUxLMFdKem90RjZEMFptZVEzcFpuOGM3X0ZIREEwZUp6NGQ1U2N0S1N1VkVDZkUtZEtz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;Study design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a countrywide, prospective, longitudinal physical activity study of US residents that evaluated their physical activity levels within the context of the walkability of their built environments before and after relocation (‘participants’).

Participants were excluded from a particular analysis if necessary information was unreported (for example, participants with no reported age were excluded from the analysis of Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;).

Anonymized Azumio Argus app data was obtained through a Data Use Agreement. Data handling and analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, which deemed this study exempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For population size statistics, refer to Extended Data Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Tab1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Tab3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Statistical methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All error bars throughout this paper correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. When these bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals do not include the null value (typically 0), they indicate a statistically significant difference at the &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05 level. All statistical hypothesis tests were two-sided Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests unless indicated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Identifying participant relocation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined participant relocation as the action of moving to a new place for a substantial amount of time. We identified participant relocation as follows. Participant location on a given day was assigned to a city based on the weather update in the participant’s app activity feed. Weather updates are automatically added to the feed of each participant according to the nearest cell phone tower. We searched for participants that stayed in one location within a 100-km radius for at least 14 days and then moved to a different location that was at least 100 km away. Participants were required to stay within a 100-km radius of this new location for at least another 14 days. The 14-day threshold was chosen to filter out short trips that may be related to business or leisure travel. Using this threshold, we find that most participants do not relocate again and spend a median of 81 days in the new location, effectively excluding the impact of short-term travel on our analyses. Most participants stopped tracking their activity at this time, rather than relocating again. In addition, we repeated our analyses with thresholds of 21 and 30 days and found highly consistent results (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig9"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). We required a substantial move distance (100 km or more) to ensure that relocating participants were exposed to a new built environment. We allowed for up to 5 days of intermediate travel between these two locations and ignored these days during analyses. We applied this method to 2,112,288 users of the Argus smartphone app and identified 31,034 relocations. Among these, we required participants to have used the app to track their physical activity for at least 10 days within the 30 days before and after their relocation (as in previous work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Althoff, T. et al.

We further required at least 1 day of tracked physical activity before and after relocation to ensure that, whenever we compare two participant populations, these populations are identical and therefore comparable (that is, we seek to identify within-participant changes in physical activity). We repeated our statistical analyses with alternative data inclusion criteria, such as the number of days with tracked physical activity, and found similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Physical activity measure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our device-based (historically often called objective) measure of physical activity was the number of steps over time recorded by the participant’s smartphone. Steps were determined based on the smartphone accelerometers and the manufacturer’s proprietary algorithms for step counting. The Azumio Argus app records step measurements on a minute-by-minute basis. These measurements are collected passively without requiring the smartphone or Azumio Argus app to be in active use.

In Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;, each circle corresponds to a pair of cities sized by the number of participants moving between those cities. We fit a linear model &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;Δ + &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; to these data with slope &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; = 16.6 (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) and intercept &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; = 25.0 (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.462).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered potential confounders such as differences in climate (using Köppen climate type&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 83" title="Köppen, W. et al.

We found that the relationship between walkability and walking behaviour still holds within pairs of cities with similar climate, for instance, moving from Miami, FL to Jacksonville, FL, or from Amarillo, TX to Euless, TX (see annotations in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt; as well as more generally in Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, we found similar effects across relocations in all seasons (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) and relocations to cities with higher, lower and similar median household income levels (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#MOESM1"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Impact of walkability across subgroups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered the effect of walkability differences on change in physical activity across subgroups based on demographics (ages 18–29, 30–49 and 50+ years), weight status (normal, overweight and obese levels of BMI), previous activity level (below 5,000, 5,000–8,500 and above 8,500 average daily steps before relocation) and gender (men and women). Owing to the approximately linear nature of the relationship between walkability changes and physical activity changes (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;), we used a linear model for estimation. For each subgroup, we ran independent linear regressions of the difference in daily steps on differences in walkability between cities at the level of individual relocations. The models included an intercept coefficient: &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="stix"&gt;⋅&lt;/span&gt; Δ + &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;. We determined the estimated coefficient of walkability (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;; that is, the increase in daily steps for each one-point increase in walkability of a city) along with 95% confidence intervals (based on Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-distribution) for each subgroup (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). We performed Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests on the regression model coefficients, which establish that relocation to a city of higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and activity level groups (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test; all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), with the exception of women over 50 years old, for which the positive difference was not statistically significant (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). We found that the effect was diminished in overweight and obese women relative to normal-weight women. Thus, the non-significant effect on women over 50 years of age may be explained, in part, by the larger average BMI of this group (27.4) compared with other women (25.3; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;). In comparison, men over 50 years of age also had a larger BMI compared with other men, but the difference was smaller than in women (28.2 versus 27.0; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Adjusting for seasonality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is influenced by climate and weather&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Tucker, P. &amp;amp; Gilliland, J.

We found that differences in physical activity levels following relocations may be influenced by seasonal variation, especially when considering comparatively long observation periods of about 6 months (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#MOESM1"&gt;3b,c&lt;/a&gt;).

This was achieved by first estimating physical activity levels separately for each calendar month and then taking the average. This process is repeated 1,000 times in our bootstrap estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Selection effects in relocation and mobile app usage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While relocation uniquely enabled the quasi-experimental study of behavioural changes in different environments, there may be selection effects driving relocation, often referred to as residential self-selection.

With respect to this possibility, note that we found no indication of increases in physical activity after moving to a location of similar walkability (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig3"&gt;3c&lt;/a&gt;). This suggests that those relocating participants are not simply more motivated to exercise, on average, but that changes in physical activity may be explained by the changing built environment. It is possible that selection effects were absent because participants may not have perceived themselves as being observed, in contrast to previous studies that featured explicit, short periods of monitoring (Hawthorne effect). We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city’s walkability (for example, length of work days). We investigated potential selection effects further by comparing the population of relocating mobile app users, first, to the overall US population, and, second, to the overall mobile app user population, including non-relocating app users. We found that the relocating participant population is similar in age (36 versus 37.7 years median age) and gender (49.8% versus 51.0% female, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.132; Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test) to the US population (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). We adjusted for differences in age for the simulation estimates in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig3"&gt;3f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Within the app user population, we found that movers and non-movers (that is, relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be close in age (43.8 versus 37.9 and 38.5 versus 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4a,b&lt;/a&gt;), and weight status (68.1% versus 59.8% and 45.6% versus 44.3% overweight and obese for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4c,d&lt;/a&gt;). However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 versus 5,825 and 5,279 versus 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4e,f&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, we found that within movers, those that relocate to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig8"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Simulating the impact of walkability improvements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We simulated the impact of US nationwide walkability improvements on US population physical activity levels. Concretely, we simulated the impact of increasing US city walkability scores to a constant target walkability score between 1 and 100. We also highlight the walkability scores of Chicago and Philadelphia (78) as well as New York City (89) to aid interpretation. As the relocation population was not explicitly drawn to be representative of the US population, we adjusted our estimates through ratio-based post-stratification weights across age-based strata&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 86" title="Bethlehem, J.

We used civilian population estimates from the US Census Bureau for 2016 as the target population distribution. While there were no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female versus 51.0% female, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.132; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;), we found slight differences in age (36.0 versus 37.7 years median age; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;), which we corrected for through sampling weights. We acknowledge that other selection effects and heterogeneous treatment effects may exist.

We used a linear regression model and data from relocations associated with both walkability increases and decreases. We estimated the total fraction of US population meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines as the sum between the fraction of people already meeting these guidelines before relocating plus the estimated addition based on the regression model.

                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH-supported trial finds dalbavancin safe, effective for treating bacteremia &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported clinical trial has found that the outcome of treating complicated &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections with two intravenous (IV) doses of the antibiotic dalbavancin seven days apart is just as good as daily IV doses of conventional antibiotics over four to six weeks. Nearly 120,000 &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections and 20,000 associated deaths occurred in the United States in 2017. The study results provide the clearest evidence to date for the safety and effectiveness of dalbavancin therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections, expanding the number of antimicrobial treatment options for clinicians and patients. The findings were published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Given the small number of antimicrobial drugs available to treat &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus &lt;/em&gt;bloodstream infections&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the bacteria’s growing drug resistance, establishing dalbavancin as a beneficial therapy for these severe infections gives us a vital new alternative to treat them,” said John Beigel, M.D., the acting director of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which sponsored and funded the trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standard therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections, or bacteremia, typically involves inserting a long IV line known as a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into a vein, usually in the arm, to deliver antibiotics through the blood for many weeks. The PICC line remains in place for the full duration of treatment, and people with a PICC line have many limitations on their activity to avoid damaging the line. Its long-term presence and use can lead to complications such as blood clots and additional infections. By contrast, dalbavancin therapy requires temporarily inserting a short catheter into a vein in the hand or arm twice for only an hour at a time. Given these differences, the investigators who designed the trial hypothesized that study participants who received dalbavancin therapy would have fewer side effects, higher rates of treatment completion, and a better quality of life than those who received standard therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Phase 2b trial enrolled 200 hospitalized adults with complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia at 23 medical centers in the United States and Canada from 2021 to 2023. The participants initially received three to 10 days of preliminary treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, had no fever, and lacked detectable &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; in their blood when it was cultured in a laboratory. The bacteria could still be present below the limit of detection, however. For study purposes, complicated bacteremia was defined as any case not meeting criteria for uncomplicated bacteremia according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s 2011 guidelines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants were assigned at random to receive either dalbavancin 1500 mg intravenously on days one and eight, or standard therapy for four to eight weeks. The antibiotics used as standard therapy were cefazolin or an anti-Staphylococcal penicillin for methicillin-susceptible &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; and vancomycin or daptomycin for methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), with the amount and frequency of dosing determined by each study site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team evaluated the likelihood that a participant randomly selected from the dalbavancin group would have a better overall treatment outcome than a participant randomly selected from the standard therapy group. The components of overall outcome were clinical success (survival with resolution of bacteremia), infectious complications, safety complications, death, and health-related quality of life. In measuring outcomes this way, the researchers aimed to capture not only the end result of antibiotic therapy, but also participants’ treatment-related experiences during therapy. A committee of four infectious disease experts ranked study participants based on the desirability of their overall treatment outcome after 70 days of therapy. To avoid risk of bias, the committee did not know which treatment the participants received.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team also did a more conventional analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin therapy to standard therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Investigators found that a participant randomly selected from the dalbavancin group was 47.7% likely to have a better overall treatment outcome than a participant randomly selected from the standard therapy group, meaning dalbavancin was not superior to standard therapy. However, the individual components of overall outcome, such as clinical success, were similar for the two groups, suggesting that dalbavancin therapy and standard therapy were equally good. This was reinforced by the finding from the conventional analysis that dalbavancin and standard therapy were similarly safe and effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our findings give patients and healthcare providers the data to support an extra choice when deciding on treatment for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia,” said Nicholas A. Turner, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, and first author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the investigators’ surprise, study participants in the two groups reported a similar health-related quality of life. It is unclear whether this is because the quality-of-life survey given to participants at each study visit failed to capture relevant differences between the groups, or because the way the antibiotics were delivered had little effect on participants’ treatment experiences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As expected, the rate of side effects leading to treatment discontinuation and of complications such as catheter-associated blood clots were greater in the standard therapy group than the dalbavancin therapy group. Yet the overarching similarities in the components of overall outcome diluted these differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To further compare the two types of therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia, the investigators are analyzing their cost effectiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Called “Dalbavancin as an Option for Treatment of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; Bacteremia” (DOTS), the study was conducted by the NIH’s Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group under the leadership of Thomas L. Holland, M.D. Dr. Holland is a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine and a member of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you fancy being healthy while you're eating something typically unhealthy, then it's also worth adding them to your next chocolate pudding.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed why millions of people struggle to get a good night's sleep—and it's not lumpy pillows or a racing mind, the problem lies in their GUT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, published in medical journal General Psychiatry, researchers explored the link between nodding off and the presence of certain types of bacteria in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study lead Shangyun Shi, from Nanjing Medical University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-a9753600-783b-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that there appears to be a direct link between &lt;span&gt;gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ms Shi used the data from 386,533 people with insomnia and compared it with data taken from two studies into microbiomes—totalling 26,548 people—who had 71 groups of bacteria in common. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded that certain types of bacteria seem to boost or lower the risk of insomnia, and the sleep disorder itself also seems to alter the presence of certain types of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis revealed a total of 14 groups of bacteria were positively associated (1-4 per cent higher odds), and 8 groups negatively associated (1-3 per cent lower odds), with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia was also noted to have an effect on gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was linked to a reduction of 43 per cent to 79 per cent of seven groups of bacteria, and a more than four-fold increase in the abundance of 12 other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Future treatments for insomnia could include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group in particular, the odoribacter class of bacteria which is also linked to was associated with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High levels of odoribacter are linked with good gut help and lower levels of inflammation in the body, while lower levels have been observed in people living with diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Shi said her study further cemented the link between 'the effects of insomnia on gut microbiota, and vice versa', adding that they have a complex two-way relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Future treatments for insomnia could therefore include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Shi noted that the study was not without limitations which needed further exploration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, all the study participants were of European descent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is important to note as the make-up of the microbiome varies among different ethnicities and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as diet and lifestyle weren't accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are known to have an effect the microbiome, and the interplay between genes and the environment, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS estimates that around a third of Britons experience insomnia, with a similar figure in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-7a1a69b0-7855-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-422b7ed0-5085-11e9-ac87-a5c80044591f" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6855797/WHAT-HAPPENS-BODIES-STAY-AWAKE-DAYS-END.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Failing to sleep for days on end can cause an array of symptoms and may even be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within the first 24 hours of sleep deprivation, the body's hormone levels change, leading to a rise in blood pressure, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/05/can-you-die-from-lack-of-sleep.html"&gt;SLATE&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By day two the body is no longer able to break down glucose properly, leading to carbohydrate cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person's body temperature also drops and their immune system becomes compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although no human has ever being reported as dying from insomnia, a 1980s study by the University of Chicago found rats died after 32 days of total sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought the rodents' body temperatures dropped so much they developed hypothermia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their immune systems may also have become so weak that bacteria normally confined to their guts spread throughout their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory is the animals became so stressed they died.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous insomniacs is the music teacher Michael Corke, of New Lenox, Illinois, who suffered from the rare disease fatal familial insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died aged 42 after an alleged six months of total sleep deprivation, however, it cannot be said for sure that insomnia is what killed him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is Randy Gardner who holds the record for the longest time without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1964 while at secondary school in San Diego, the then 17-year-old stayed awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the experiment, Mr Gardner developed speech and memory problems, and began hallucinating, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepio.com/articles/sleep-science/how-long-can-you-go-without-sleep/"&gt;Sleepio&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed why millions of people struggle to get a good night's sleep—and it's not lumpy pillows or a racing mind, the problem lies in their GUT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, published in medical journal General Psychiatry, researchers explored the link between nodding off and the presence of certain types of bacteria in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study lead Shangyun Shi, from Nanjing Medical University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-a9753600-783b-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that there appears to be a direct link between &lt;span&gt;gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ms Shi used the data from 386,533 people with insomnia and compared it with data taken from two studies into microbiomes—totalling 26,548 people—who had 71 groups of bacteria in common. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded that certain types of bacteria seem to boost or lower the risk of insomnia, and the sleep disorder itself also seems to alter the presence of certain types of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis revealed a total of 14 groups of bacteria were positively associated (1-4 per cent higher odds), and 8 groups negatively associated (1-3 per cent lower odds), with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia was also noted to have an effect on gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was linked to a reduction of 43 per cent to 79 per cent of seven groups of bacteria, and a more than four-fold increase in the abundance of 12 other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Future treatments for insomnia could include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group in particular, the odoribacter class of bacteria which is also linked to was associated with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High levels of odoribacter are linked with good gut help and lower levels of inflammation in the body, while lower levels have been observed in people living with diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Shi said her study further cemented the link between 'the effects of insomnia on gut microbiota, and vice versa', adding that they have a complex two-way relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Future treatments for insomnia could therefore include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Shi noted that the study was not without limitations which needed further exploration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, all the study participants were of European descent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is important to note as the make-up of the microbiome varies among different ethnicities and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as diet and lifestyle weren't accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are known to have an effect the microbiome, and the interplay between genes and the environment, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS estimates that around a third of Britons experience insomnia, with a similar figure in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-7a1a69b0-7855-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-422b7ed0-5085-11e9-ac87-a5c80044591f" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6855797/WHAT-HAPPENS-BODIES-STAY-AWAKE-DAYS-END.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Failing to sleep for days on end can cause an array of symptoms and may even be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within the first 24 hours of sleep deprivation, the body's hormone levels change, leading to a rise in blood pressure, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/05/can-you-die-from-lack-of-sleep.html"&gt;SLATE&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By day two the body is no longer able to break down glucose properly, leading to carbohydrate cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person's body temperature also drops and their immune system becomes compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although no human has ever being reported as dying from insomnia, a 1980s study by the University of Chicago found rats died after 32 days of total sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought the rodents' body temperatures dropped so much they developed hypothermia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their immune systems may also have become so weak that bacteria normally confined to their guts spread throughout their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory is the animals became so stressed they died.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous insomniacs is the music teacher Michael Corke, of New Lenox, Illinois, who suffered from the rare disease fatal familial insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died aged 42 after an alleged six months of total sleep deprivation, however, it cannot be said for sure that insomnia is what killed him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is Randy Gardner who holds the record for the longest time without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1964 while at secondary school in San Diego, the then 17-year-old stayed awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the experiment, Mr Gardner developed speech and memory problems, and began hallucinating, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepio.com/articles/sleep-science/how-long-can-you-go-without-sleep/"&gt;Sleepio&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are complicated conditions, new research suggests taking a vitamin D supplement may help lower blood sugar in certain groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11938431/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the Endocrine Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed data from 10 clinical trials involving nearly 4,500 people with prediabetes. The researchers discovered that 18.5% of study participants who took vitamin D reached normal blood sugar levels, compared to 14% who took a placebo. In all of the trials, the data showed that people with prediabetes who took vitamin D were more likely to develop normal blood sugar levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=christak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., is a vitamin D researcher and professor of microbiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School; &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, is author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game Changers&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; is a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/ankit-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ankit Shah, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ankit Shah, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., assistant professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nutrition at Rutgers – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/anastassios-pittas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anastassios Pittas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anastassios Pittas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, is a study co-author and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between vitamin D and blood sugar management seems random, but doctors say there is something to this.

Also known as calciferol, the vitamin helps your gut’s absorption of calcium. If you don’t have enough vitamin D, your bones may become thin and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vitamin D plays many roles in the body, including reducing inflammation and supporting immune function and blood sugar metabolism, according to the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is produced by your body when your skin is exposed to the sun’s rays, and it’s also found in some foods, like certain fatty fish, mushrooms, and fortified milk and cereal, says &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game Changers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might vitamin D help with blood sugar management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, although this isn’t the first time vitamin D has been linked with managing diabetes. A scientific analysis published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-3018" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2023 analyzed three clinical trials that studied the impact of vitamin D supplementation on people with prediabetes. During a three-year follow-up, the researchers discovered that 22.7% of participants who took vitamin D developed type 2 diabetes, compared to 25% of those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences aren’t massive—meaning, taking a vitamin D supplement isn’t a guarantee that you’ll avoid developing type 2 diabetes—but many experts agree that there does seem to be something here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory behind this link is that vitamin D impacts glycemic control, which is your body’s ability to manage your blood sugar, Cording says. “Vitamin D is actually a hormone,” Cording points out. Having healthy levels of vitamin D may &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; help regulate other hormones in the body, helping to support the function of your endocrine system. (Type 2 diabetes impacts the endocrine system, which regulates glucose, a.k.a. blood sugar, levels in the blood, Cording explains.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is also &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-5996-5-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a lower risk of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38595773/what-is-insulin-resistance-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is when the body is unable to respond to or use the hormone insulin. Insulin helps to escort sugar to your cells, where it’s used for energy. Insulin resistance is often seen as a part of prediabetes and a precursor for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, vitamin D may have an anti-inflammatory effect, and inflammation is a known risk factor for developing diabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/ankit-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ankit Shah, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ankit Shah, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., assistant professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nutrition at Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still a lot of unknowns here. “The mechanisms involved in potential helpful effects of vitamin D in lowering the risk for type 2 diabetes at this time have not been well defined,” says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=christak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., a vitamin D researcher and professor of microbiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she points out that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9938722/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; suggest that people with low vitamin D levels also seem to have impaired pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance. Both of those are linked to the development of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also entirely possible that there’s nothing to this link, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “It’s very easy to find studies that show associations,” he says. “You have to accept that many studies that were done showed no association and never came to light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I use vitamin D to manage blood sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of right now, there’s no official recommendation on using vitamin D to manage blood sugar in people with prediabetes. However, Christakos recommends having your vitamin D levels tested if you’re at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. If you’re low, your doctor may recommend that you take a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35686472/best-vitamin-d-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D supplement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; to support several areas of your health, not just your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah agrees. “While vitamin D deficiency and diabetes are two separate issues that have different treatment strategies, there might be a benefit such that treating one issue may have positive spillover effects on the other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your doctor says you could benefit from taking a vitamin D supplement, it’s important to have the right expectations for what this could do for you, says &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/anastassios-pittas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anastassios Pittas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anastassios Pittas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D should be viewed as part of an overall diabetes prevention plan, not a stand-alone solution,” he says. “In the vitamin D and diabetes prevention trials, participants took an average of about 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily. That dose would be a good starting point.” He says some people may need a bit less or more, depending on their lifestyle and size. Again, it’s important to consult your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cording says it’s important to keep in mind that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; overdo it with vitamin D. So, you don’t want to put yourself on this vitamin without talking to a healthcare professional first. “Taking too much vitamin D can lead to vitamin D toxicity,” she points out. That can cause your body to absorb too much calcium, raising your risk of kidney stones and constipation. In extreme cases, it may even lead to heart rhythm issues, kidney failure, and death, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind-healthprofessional/#h36" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to lower type 2 diabetes risk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah stresses that you’re not doomed to develop type 2 diabetes if you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes. “Having prediabetes puts you at risk for developing overt type 2 diabetes, but it does not have to be a foregone conclusion,” he says. “One can prevent, or at least delay, this progression by employing multiple well-known strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means focusing on eating a low-glycemic diet, doing your best to manage your weight (as this may impact insulin resistance), and exercising regularly, Dr. Cutler says. “These are all proven to both prevent type 2 diabetes and help with blood sugar control,” he says. Dr. Shah also recommends trying to reduce your stress levels and aiming to get at least seven hours of sleep a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to have a conversation with your healthcare provider if you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes. They should be able to give you personalized guidance on next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:05:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1Hc25HekppWnM4ZHlBTElJVm9lZzUydGd0Rm0xSWF1a3dzZTMtd093UWpNVHBJbUwtR2Rvek05blpxVWdaQ19KSXlzWGllNm0tUEVTZ3NRdmxyUzBYN3FjZFRuUlhPRzV5cl9LbmhQUVNqWV81Z0JxOA</guid></item><item><title>新疗法在82%的患者中消除了膀胱癌-南加州大学凯克医学院</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQMFZ5YV83OGRPWDdIaTlCYUtaZ0ZTbXBqQmFCQ1hGTUN4MVJmS1ZTRkx5Wlc4YzdLQzRPVmVXdDZyR3VNbi1JT3hpUkNhNlFGTWJYVUNPSER4aTA5cUdFcUhJX3gycDlmdlJjUXhKWkRoYWNVRUd2MDc4QjdXM25ickxBLVdldnk0V3VUQnJGaVl0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text_companyprofile"&gt;

                TAR-200 is a miniature, pretzel-shaped drug-device duo containing a chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, which is inserted into the bladder through a catheter and releases the drug for three weeks per treatment cycle.
            &lt;/p&gt;          
         &lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the drug delivery system works &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TAR-200 is a miniature, pretzel-shaped drug-device duo containing a chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, which is inserted into the bladder through a catheter. Once inside the bladder, the TAR-200 slowly and consistently releases the gemcitabine into the organ for three weeks per treatment cycle.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Traditionally, gemcitabine has been delivered to the bladder as a liquid solution that only stays in the bladder for a few hours, which had limited effect destroying the cancer, said Daneshmand, who is also a member of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/services/cancer-care/norris-cancer-center/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The theory behind this study was that the longer the medicine sits inside the bladder, the more deeply it would penetrate the bladder and the more cancer it would destroy,” he said. “And it appears that having the chemotherapy released slowly over weeks rather than in just a few hours is a much more effective approach.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient population in the clinical trial &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical trial, known as the SunRISe-1, was conducted at 144 locations globally, including at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/about/keck-hospital-of-usc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keck Hospital of USC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It included 85 patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is the most common form of bladder cancer. The disease is considered high risk when, depending on the type and location of the tumors, the cancer carries a higher chance of recurrence and/or spreading to the bladder muscles or other parts of the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The standard treatment for this type of bladder cancer is an immunotherapy drug, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, which may be ineffective in a percentage of patients. All the patients in the clinical trial had been previously treated with this drug, but their cancer had returned.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The standard treatment plan for these patients &lt;span&gt;was surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissue and organs, which has many health risks and may negatively impact patients’ quality of life,” said Daneshmand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To offer patients a better option, urologic oncologists treated patients with TAR-200 every three weeks for six months, and then four times a year for the next two years. In 70 out of 85 patients, the cancer disappeared and for almost half the patients, was still gone a year later. The treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study also showed that administering TAR-200 along with another immunotherapy drug (cetrelimab) did not prove as effective as TAR-200 on its own and had more side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While participants in the clinical trial will be followed for another year, the study is closed to new participants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of slow-release cancer drugs &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This clinical trial is one of several ongoing ones investigating the effect of TAR-200 and the slow release of cancer-fighting drugs into the bladder to fight cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are at an exciting moment in history,” said Daneshmand, who has been researching this novel treatment since 2016. “Our mission is to deliver cancer-fighting medications into the bladder that will offer lasting remission from cancer, and it looks like we are well on our way toward that goal.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted TAR-200 a New Drug Application Priority Review, which means the FDA plans to take quicker action on the application than other applications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health care corporation Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson manufactures TAR-200.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a bad hare day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rapidly spreading virus is causing cottontail rabbits to grow black, tentacle-like growths out of their heads, prompting warnings to steer clear of the mutated animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The so-called Frankenbunnies have been spotted multiple times in Fort Collins, Colorado. Resident Susan Mansfield &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told 9News&lt;/a&gt; she saw a rabbit with what looked like “black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A viral photo of the “Frankenstein” rabbit that was filmed in Minnesota in 2013.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gunnar Boettcher/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A rapidly-spreading condition called cottontail papilloma virus is causing cottontail rabbits to grow black, tentacle-like protrusions out of their heads, prompting warnings to steer clear of the mutated animals. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t,” she said. “He came back a second year, and it grew.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;One person described the infected critter as having “a scabbiesh-looking growth over their face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The so-called bunny blight is actually a disease called cottontail papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, which causes cottontails to sprout tumors around their head.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is spread by parasites ticks and fleas, which pass on the ailment through their bites, &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/rabbit/conditions/viral/c_rb_shope_papilloma_virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Pet MD.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Typically rabbits become infected in the warmer months of summer when transmitted by being bitten by insects like fleas and ticks,” said Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose, per &lt;a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2025/08/12/frankenstein-rabbits-with-papillomas-sprout-tentacle-like-growths/85628242007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Coloradoan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A bunny with a veritable beard of black growths. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reddit/RecommendationPast54&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the recent sightings occurred in Colorado, the disease most frequently rears its horny head&lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/diseases-of-research-animals-dora/rabbits/rabbit-shope-papilloma-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; in the Midwest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a Minnesota resident caused a stir after posting a video of a tendril-ridden rabbit in his backyard, which he dubbed the “Frankenstein” bunny and &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;compared to the mythical Jackalope&lt;/a&gt; — a hoax that was promulgated by jokesters sewing antlers onto taxidermy rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In light of the rampant CRPV sightings, wildlife experts have warned people not to approach or handle any of the afflicted critters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth,” said Fort Collins, Colorado resident Susan Mansfield while describing one of the infected critters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reddit/Different_Try3353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, while the virus can spread between rabbits, it is not known to infect humans or pets and is therefore not considered a threat to public health, according to &lt;a href="https://cpw.state.co.us/species/cottontail-rabbits#:~:text=Rabbit%20Papillomas,be%20treated%20by%20a%20veterinarian." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rabbits, on the other hand, are often not so lucky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although cases can resolve on their own, the Medusa-like protrusions can also balloon up to the point that they interfere with the infected carrot cruncher’s ability to eat, causing the creatures to die of starvation, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14993099/Frankenstein-rabbits-tentacles-heads-colorado.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Daily Mail reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In addition, the disease is more severe in domestic bunnies than their wild brethren, with the big fear being that they can develop squamous cell carcinoma — a serious and potentially fatal skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this reason, experts advise keeping pet rabbits away from pets.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If a rabbit does become infected, veterinarians can surgically excise the malevolent dreadlocks before they can become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, CRPV has no known cure. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you think last week's decision by the federal government to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-halts-500-million-for-mrna-vaccine-research/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;halt $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of vaccines &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/therapy/mrnavaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/jeff-coller/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Jeff Coller&lt;/a&gt;, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a "completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr." that was "clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-trump-surgeon-general-rfk-mrna-vaccine-research/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology "helps us develop vaccines and new treatments," and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the "most promising areas of modern medicine." &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology," Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' "&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/face-the-nation" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06063-y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving," Coller said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt; Phase 2 trial&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39115419/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11919954/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;colorectal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1094199" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;gastric&lt;/a&gt; cancers. For example, a study published online in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10120-025-01640-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;journal Gastric Cancer&lt;/a&gt; found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/infant-worlds-first-patient-personalized-gene-editing-treatment-crispr-liver-disorder/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;personalized gene-editing treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases," he said. "We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes," Coller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is mRNA medicine so versatile? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Coller put it: "If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To harness that power for treating disease, "All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller — who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts — hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc5" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have to keep moving forward," he said. "People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving."&lt;/p&gt;

The study cannot prove the cause, but suggests it could be down to lifestyle factors such an increase in drinking and smoking, or changes in the type or patterns of sleep – all of which can increase the risk of the condition. As a result, they have called the phenomenon “social apnoea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Obviously, people tend to drink more on the weekend. They tend to smoke more on the weekend if they are prone to smoking,” said Prof Danny Eckert, a co-author of the research at Flinders University in Australia, adding that as well as a possible effect from irregular sleep patterns, it might also be that people were less likely to use devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machines to manage the condition at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers say regardless of the underlying cause, the results matter given the health and safety implications of OSA. It is known to &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/obstructive-sleep-apnoea/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raise&lt;/a&gt; the risk of conditions including stroke, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and can also affect driving safety as a result of sleepiness, have an impact on relationships, and reduce quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202505-1184RL" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Eckert and colleagues report how they analysed de-identified data from 70,052 people – the majority of whom were middle-aged, male, and overweight – who used a commercially available under-mattress sleep sensor that can track heart rate, snoring and sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All participants had four or more sleep recordings a week, at least 28 sleep apnoea measurements a year, and five or more breathing disruptions an hour during sleep, on average, a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the odds of moderate to severe sleep apnoea, meaning 15 or more breathing interruptions an hour, were 18% higher on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, and the effect was more pronounced in men and people under the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They also found weekend catch-up sleep of 45 minutes or more, compared with less than six minutes, and social jetlag – in other words, a clock-shift in sleep patterns – of 60 minutes or more, compared with less than 18 minutes, was associated with 47% and 38% greater odds of having moderate to severe OSA respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Sriram Iyer, an NHS respiratory and sleep consultant, who was not involved in the work, said the study highlighted the night-to-night variability in OSA symptoms, and the team’s assumptions about the cause of the weekend uptick were “perfectly reasonable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ryan Chin Taw Cheong, a consultant ENT and sleep surgeon at the Cleveland clinic, London, praised the size of the study, saying it was the first of its kind to look at variability in the severity of the condition throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While he noted that study did not include data on participants’ lifestyles, meaning it could not prove the cause of the increased severity of OSA at the weekends, he said factors such as smoking and drinking were known to exacerbate symptoms, and addressing such issues – alongside diet and weight – should be one of the first steps taken to tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With the best intentions, we can try to treat you medically. But if you’re consuming lots of alcohol or smoking heavily, whatever we’re doing as medical professionals will be just a drop in the ocean,” Cheong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPcHo0UTd1VmhzVkJMOUVNUk5pQWJmRWhlXzJaa2R1WmcwR3JyNlpWMWxVWGhDRW50UkpMWTVIY1dUY3Z2bXM2RGQwUVZnR3ZON0h5d2lPM1ByOEg2NTFwczF1Skp5TGJxWEFyNjgtSUhiOVRXNmY3Z09DcGRndXV6RnZKbkE3b1BzbVlxY0VhVXZMbDRiU29vbGY1SmkyVmxiMUQ4TmpmWWZNb1lnOUE</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐用于疟疾病媒控制的空间散发器，并对前两种产品进行资格预审-世界卫生组织（世卫组织）</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0gFBVV95cUxOZmEzeU8zSHNudHBSWDIxTVhsYW45STdlRU9sSWNxYTZ1bWVFSnViQkJSLTJuSnh0MVBJYldPVGxLVTNkNmxLOHdCLW9WOVFUNEZaNTgwUlBIVmo3c1Jfb3ZRazF1dWduWURoRTN4dzEyQVJtNjlmVDlzRmlBbERJOS1mTk50N2dzM25MVWRFamF6U3NtV0Q1S0h6TnNtYUNlc0dOQlcxOWdPbHhLeXdoVlJoeThhdlRBUWZRXzdyQlhuYkFJcEpZcWM5SXJxOVp3Nnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a &lt;a target="_blank" href="/publications/i/item/guidelines-for-malaria"&gt;new recommendation&lt;/a&gt; supporting the use of spatial emanators, introducing a new class of intervention for malaria vector control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial emanators – also known as spatial repellents – emit active ingredients into the air to kill mosquitoes, deter them from entering treated spaces, and prevent them from locating and biting human hosts. They offer a promising complement to existing prevention measures such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying.  Unlike ITNs, spatial emanators may provide an added layer of protection against day-time mosquito biting, when residents of a household are active within the home and not sleeping under a net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This recommendation opens the door to a new intervention for national malaria control programmes at a time when innovation is urgently needed,” said Dr Daniel Ngamije, Director a.i., Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases, WHO.  “As rising insecticide resistance and changes in mosquito behaviour threaten the effectiveness of long-standing vector control tools, spatial emanators offer an innovative approach to help protect people at risk from infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The WHO conditional recommendation for spatial repellents is a significant step forward in providing access to a new malaria vector control intervention,” said Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid. “Unitaid is proud to have supported research proving that spatial repellents, when used alongside insecticide-treated nets, can significantly reduce malaria transmission. At a time when progress against malaria has stalled, spatial repellents are the first new class of vector control intervention in decades, offering a new approach to protect people at risk. &lt;a href="https://unitaid.org/news-blog/unitaid-funded-research-drives-who-recommendation-of-spatial-repellents-the-first-new-malaria-vector-control-tool-in-decades/" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Unitaid will continue to support&lt;/a&gt; efforts to ensure market access for these tools, generate further evidence on their potential as a standalone intervention, and help define a set of use cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also prequalified two spatial emanators products, Mosquito Shield and Guardian, manufactured by SC Johnson &amp;amp; Son, Inc. The products emit the active ingredient transfluthrin which has the effect of repelling, disorienting and killing mosquitoes which transmit malaria. The products have been shown to remain effective for up to 1-month and 12-months, respectively, meaning that they can be deployed in a variety of settings where replacement strategies and distribution schedules may differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prequalification decision is expected to support procurement decisions at international, regional, and national levels by UN and partner procurement agencies, as well as member states, ultimately enabling faster and broader access to these products in communities with urgent needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO prequalification programme assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of each submitted product. The complete WHO public assessment reports can be found on the product pages for each product in the  &lt;a href="https://extranet.who.int/prequal/vector-control-products/prequalified-product-list" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;list of prequalified vector control products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This achievement showcases the close and continuing partnership between two departments at WHO headquarters – Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases, Regulation and Prequalification – to speed up access to high-impact tools to the people who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on the WHO recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;WHO has issued a &lt;strong&gt;conditional recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; in support of the use of spatial emanators indoors in addition to ITNs to prevent and control malaria in both children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. The recommendation is based on moderate-certainty evidence from 5 studies that independently evaluated both passive emanators and mosquito coils against malaria. The trials assessing passive emanators were conducted in settings where other malaria control tools – such as ITNs – were already in use. For more on the recommendation, visit the &lt;a target="_blank" href="/teams/global-malaria-programme/guidelines-for-malaria"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHO guidelines for malaria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this recommendation marks a major step forward, key evidence gaps remain – particularly around the effectiveness of spatial emanators when used alone, their potential to protect people outdoors or in humanitarian emergencies, and their role in managing insecticide resistance. Global research and funding partners are now working to close these gaps and strengthen the evidence base for spatial emanators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond malaria, spatial emanators are also being evaluated for their potential to reduce the transmission of dengue virus and other arboviruses. Results from a first trial in Peru found that spatial emanators reduced arbovirus infection in the study population; a second trial in South-East Asia has just been completed and analyses are under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, data from these trials spanning malaria to arboviral diseases will inform future deliberations of the relevant WHO guideline development groups, potentially leading to new and/or updated recommendations for the expanded use of spatial emanators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Though medically stable at first, he soon developed hallucinations and paranoia. The cause turned out to be bromide toxicity—triggered by a health experiment he began after consulting ChatGPT. The case, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlights a rare but reversible form of psychosis that may have been influenced by generative artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a disconnection from reality. It often involves hallucinations, where people hear, see, or feel things that are not there, or delusions, which are fixed beliefs that persist despite clear evidence to the contrary. People experiencing psychosis may have difficulty distinguishing between real and imagined experiences, and may behave in ways that seem irrational or confusing to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosis is not a diagnosis in itself, but a symptom that can appear in a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. It can also be triggered by brain injuries, infections, or toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man’s initial presentation was unusual but not dramatic. He came to the emergency department reporting that his neighbor was trying to poison him. His vital signs and physical examination were mostly normal. Routine laboratory tests, however, revealed some striking abnormalities: extremely high chloride levels, a highly negative anion gap, and severe phosphate deficiency. Despite this, he denied using any medications or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As doctors searched for answers, his mental state worsened. Within a day, he was hallucinating and behaving erratically. He had to be placed on a psychiatric hold and was started on risperidone to manage his symptoms. But a deeper look at his bloodwork suggested a rare toxic condition: bromism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromism occurs when bromide—a chemical similar to chloride—builds up in the body to toxic levels. Historically, bromide was used in sedatives and other medications, but it was phased out in the United States by the late 1980s. It is still used in some industrial and cleaning applications. In cases of bromism, bromide can interfere with chloride tests and cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms ranging from confusion to full-blown psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man’s doctors consulted with Poison Control and eventually confirmed that bromism was the likely cause of his symptoms. After being stabilized with fluids and nutritional support, the man revealed a key detail: for the past three months, he had been replacing regular table salt with sodium bromide. His motivation was nutritional—he wanted to eliminate chloride from his diet, based on what he believed were harmful effects of sodium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief was strengthened, he explained, by information he had received from ChatGPT. While experimenting with ways to improve his health, he asked the chatbot whether chloride could be replaced. The model reportedly offered bromide as an alternative, without flagging any health risks or asking why the substitution was being considered. Encouraged by what he interpreted as scientific endorsement, he purchased sodium bromide online and began consuming it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests confirmed that his blood bromide level had reached 1700 mg/L—well above the normal range of 0.9 to 7.3 mg/L. After stopping the supplement and receiving supportive treatment, his psychiatric symptoms gradually subsided. He was weaned off risperidone before discharge and remained stable in follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual incident carries several caveats. A single case report cannot establish causation. There may have been multiple factors contributing to the man’s psychosis, and his exact interaction with ChatGPT remains unverified. The medical team does not have access to the chatbot conversation logs and cannot confirm the exact wording or sequence of messages that led to the decision to consume bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case reports, by nature, describe only one patient’s experience. They are not designed to test hypotheses or rule out alternative explanations. In some cases, rare outcomes may simply be coincidental or misunderstood. Without controlled studies or broader surveillance, it is difficult to know how common—or uncommon—such incidents truly are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their limitations, case reports often serve as early warning signs in medicine. They tend to highlight novel presentations, unexpected side effects, or emerging risks that are not yet widely recognized. Many medical breakthroughs and safety reforms have started with a single unusual case. In this instance, the authors argue that the use of AI-powered chatbots should be considered when evaluating unusual psychiatric presentations, especially when patients are known to seek health advice online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case also raises broader concerns about the growing role of generative AI in personal health decisions. Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained to provide fluent, human-like responses. But they do not understand context, cannot assess user intent, and are not equipped to evaluate medical risk. In this case, the bot may have listed bromide as a chemical analogue to chloride without realizing that a user might interpret that information as a dietary recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/chatgpt-psychosis-this-scientist-predicted-ai-induced-delusions-two-years-later-it-appears-he-was-right/" target="_blank"&gt;chatbots could contribute to psychosis&lt;/a&gt; once seemed speculative. But recent editorials and anecdotal reports suggest that this may be a real, if rare, phenomenon—especially among individuals with underlying vulnerability. Danish psychiatrist Søren Dinesen Østergaard was among the first to raise the alarm. In 2023, he published a warning in Schizophrenia Bulletin, suggesting that the cognitive dissonance of interacting with a seemingly intelligent but ultimately mechanical system could destabilize users who already struggle with reality-testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, multiple stories have emerged of individuals who experienced dramatic changes in thinking and behavior after prolonged chatbot use. Some became convinced that they had divine missions, while others believed they were communicating with sentient beings. In one reported case, a man believed he had been chosen by ChatGPT to “break” a simulated reality. In another, a user’s romantic partner came to believe that the chatbot was a spiritual guide and began withdrawing from human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories tend to follow a pattern: intense engagement with the chatbot, increasingly eccentric beliefs, and a lack of pushback from the system itself. Critics point out that language models are trained to reward user satisfaction, which can mean agreeing with or amplifying the user’s worldview—even when it is distorted or delusional. That dynamic may mimic what psychiatrists call confirmation bias, a known contributor to psychotic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some developers are exploring ways to detect when a conversation appears to touch on delusional thinking—such as references to secret messages or supernatural identity—and redirect users to professional help. But such systems are still in their infancy, and the commercial incentives for chatbot companies tend to prioritize engagement over safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case of the Seattle man is a sobering reminder of how even a seemingly minor substitution—replacing salt with a chemical cousin—can spiral into a medical and psychiatric emergency when guided by decontextualized information. While AI chatbots have potential to support healthcare in structured settings, this report suggests they may also present hidden risks, especially for users who take their advice literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;A Case of Bromism Influenced by Use of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Audrey Eichenberger, Stephen Thielke, and Adam Van Buskirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:06:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOMWpPX1ZOUVNSemZzZU9hVklJSmpBQVdxU2ZfOW9COE1jUm5veWtCM3VyM3JZdVlMTVB6a1VHUHNsS3BFbHRDb1Q4ekxXa2YzazY1dUJ4M2E5V29UNTlEaG1NaFdTa3FobzFUQmJ4RGlaSHZRQXVINEVUUEdvYzRzOXEycVNPOXBrajdXaV9sTWtFdjFtWW84TlVBV29DOGRldWdFaVFn</guid></item><item><title>素食饮食可降低高达45%的癌症风险，大型研究发现- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPTk5VMncxeUNscVJsY0JuR3lLdDlQTG5ZWk42YW9UNmZ5Mk5ORUxrWXpGYTdGWDZEUG1Hdi1iMDBEem1YWHhSU2pFaDFIVEdIckJGUldmSDQ3c1FnVV9NbFNxcWo0SzBybW03cThFRXFOdXpwU1JZYjhlTk1QVTJydjJfb1kzeVc3c3kxWXJadDBjeDdtUVJRM25NeUhZZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Nutr&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that the clearest impacts would be seen in the gastrointestinal system, the team notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These organs have direct contact with foods and their breakdown products during digestion and other derived metabolites that are provided by the actions of gut bacteria," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.06.006"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Fraser and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Processed meats are accepted as risk factors for both of these sites, and for stomach cancer also, higher intakes of fruits (especially citrus), grilled and barbecued fish and meats, and vegetables probably confer protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet did not, however, seem to convey any protection from other types of cancers, including those that impact the urinary tract or nervous system, Fraser notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may also be pointing the finger at several other cancers – such as lung, ovary, and pancreas," &lt;a href="https://news.llu.edu/research/study-shows-vegetarian-diets-have-reduced-risk-medium-frequency-cancers"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Fraser. "The evidence from this study was suggestive of lower risk in vegetarians, but did not quite reach the necessary standard to say more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is a large study spanning a long time period, it can only provide evidence for trends, as opposed to causes. So it may well be that those who are choosing to avoid animal products are also more likely to make other decisions that positively impact their health as well, like exercising more, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-help-fight-breast-cancer-experiments-show"&gt;also associated&lt;/a&gt; with better outcomes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-reduces-death-from-colon-cancer-by-37-study-finds"&gt;when it comes to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on Seventh-day adventists helps somewhat account for this limitation, as religious followers tend to put a strong emphasis on healthiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that taking any diet too far can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/extreme-vegan-diets-can-be-very-bad-for-you-a-nutritionist-explains-why"&gt;health problems, too&lt;/a&gt;. Vegetarian diets can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-estimates-millions-in-us-risk-liver-damage-from-herbal-remedies"&gt;nutrient deficiencies&lt;/a&gt; if not executed correctly. This can be a lot harder to do for those of us living in less wealthy areas and more likely surrounded by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2023.103184"&gt;food deserts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/food-swamps-scientists-explain-the-health-risks-of-living-inside-them"&gt;swamped by unhealthy options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, vegetarianism can be extremely difficult for those with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-sussed-out-a-driving-mechanism-behind-irritable-bowel-syndrome"&gt;dietary health conditions&lt;/a&gt; to achieve. For these reasons, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegan-diet-can-improve-heart-health-in-just-8-weeks-study-reveals"&gt;researchers often emphasize&lt;/a&gt; that including more vegetables in your diet, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-daily-meal-plan-that-could-sustain-10-billion-people"&gt;becoming strictly vegan&lt;/a&gt;, is the most important takeaway from all these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.06.006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Then &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-protein-do-i-need/" target="_blank"&gt;protein in your soda&lt;/a&gt;. The latest wellness staple sneaking into your pantry is creatine. In the days of yore, creatine supplements were a muscle-bro staple, relegated to the lockers of collegiate linebackers and bodybuilders. Lately, it has muscled its way into Pilates studios, gym girlies’ TikToks, and longevity wellness retreats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="TiktokEmbedContainer-kStCbK ctMwBJ"&gt;&lt;div class="MessageBannerWrapper-klYDnQ dPveNI ConsentBannerWrapper-bRwBBp jQIVit" data-testid="message-banner"&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE MessageBannerContent-gGBSYC deqABF cTlmpd jzGeJP"&gt;&lt;h4 class="ConsentBannerTitle-laHQtm hoOHDt"&gt;TikTok content&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This content can also be viewed on the site it &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@melrobbins/video/7486864431763180842" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window" class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE BaseLink-eTpkqh ConsentBannerLink-dEGWLe deqABF cTlmpd hxjKSp"&gt;originates&lt;/a&gt; from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Creatine has been gaining popularity among women across different age groups,” says Gretchen Zimmermann, a registered dietitian. “We do see women who are lifting heavier, and there used to be this thing that was circulating a decade or two ago, where women thought that if they lifted heavy, they would get bulked up. Now we know that’s not true, and naturally there’s some interest in creatine for that reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; creatine? Here's everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="TableOfContentWrapper-jDOHAN fhKwHR table-of-content"&gt;&lt;div data="[object Object]" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT bgMFty"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;p class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM diANax"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw cSYOvq" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="creatine-explained" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Creatine, Explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine is a compound your body produces in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas, according to Federica Amati, a medical scientist and registered public health nutritionist. Most of it ends up in your skeletal muscles, where it’s stored as phosphocreatine and used to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that powers muscle contractions, nerve signals, and protein synthesis for tissue repair. The rest—&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass"}' href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt;—is found in brain tissue and the testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;You make about a gram of creatine a day from three amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine. You also get more from animal-based foods like red meat, fish, and poultry. For most healthy people, that’s enough. So, creatine supplements aren’t essential for general health, but they can boost performance and recovery under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-creatine-works-in-the-body" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;How Creatine Works in the Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit"&gt;Photo by Steve Mitchell/EMPICS via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;ATP is your cells’ main energy source. High-intensity exercise drains it fast, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553175/"&gt;breaking ATP down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine phosphate donates a phosphate group to ADP, recycling it back into ATP almost immediately. The more phosphocreatine stored in your muscles, the faster you can regenerate ATP and the more power you can produce in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="muscle-growth-and-exercise-performance" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Muscle Growth and Exercise Performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine is most useful for activities that demand short, intense effort: sprinting, weightlifting, and high-intensity interval training, to name a few. It’s far less relevant for endurance sports like marathons. Some evidence suggests creatine also increases muscle glycogen storage, which could help with recovery and energy replenishment between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine doesn’t directly build muscle, but paired with resistance training and adequate nutrition, it can help preserve muscle strength and lean body mass. It’s particularly important if you’re recovering from an injury, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/" target="_blank"&gt;as you age&lt;/a&gt;, when sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) becomes a risk, as it activates specialized stem cells known as satellite cells. Zimmerman points out that women, especially in perimenopause and menopause, may see health benefits. “As women get older—starting in our forties—we lose body mass 1 to 2 percent a year, and that can affect bone health later on in life,” says Zimmermann. “Creatine [supplements] support keeping and building lean muscle mass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Zimmermann adds, “Women tend to have lower muscle mass than men, just naturally, so I think women may actually respond better to supplementation, because they’re at baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="creatine-and-brain-health" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Creatine and Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic performance are well-documented, its effects on mental performance are still emerging. Early findings are promising. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may reduce mental fatigue, especially during high-stress situations, such as sleep deprivation or exhaustive exercise. It may also improve certain aspects of memory, particularly in groups with lower baseline creatine levels, such as vegetarians and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some preliminary research even suggests it could help with symptoms of depression by supporting brain energy and boosting the production of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. That’s particularly relevant for women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, says Zimmerman. “Estrogen shifts affect brain health, our mood, brain fog, and being able to think clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="the-best-form-of-creatine" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Best Form of Creatine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nowadays, step into any GNC and you’ll find several forms of creatine: creatine hydrochloride, magnesium creatine chelate, creatine citrate, creatine nitrate, creatine ethyl ester, and buffered creatine. But creatine monohydrate is the most studied, the most effective, and usually the cheapest, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. No other form has shown any additional benefits, confirms Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine monohydrate is typically sold as a flavorless, white powder that you can mix into water or a shake. The standard dose is three to five grams per day, says Amati. Some athletes may “load” with higher doses, but studies show this offers no long-term benefits and can put unnecessary stress on the kidneys, says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="is-creatine-safe" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Is Creatine Safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For most healthy adults, creatine is a safe and well-tolerated supplement for months or even years of use. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found no significant health risks. The main side effects are minor: weight gain from temporary water retention in the first week of supplementation, bloating, and mild gastric discomfort, usually from oversize doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="testing" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT bgMFty"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Meet the Experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="paywall"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/v2/offers/wir_generic_ctrl?source=Site_0_HCL_WIR_EDIT_HARDCODED_0_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE_ZZ" target="_blank"&gt;Power up with unlimited access to WIRED&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to make Greek yogurt at home is simple with this easy recipe. Start by making homemade yogurt by heating milk, combining it with a little bit of already-cultured yogurt and letting it sit in a warm spot until the milk turns into yogurt. Making protein-rich Greek yogurt takes one step beyond regular yogurt: straining the yogurt to thicken it. You can add the leftover liquid—also known as whey—to smoothies, or you can use it in place of buttermilk in baking.
&lt;/p&gt;

That’s why when my editor challenged me to eat a serving of almonds every single day for a week, I was really looking forward (and a little nervous) to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Over the week, I kept close tabs on how I was feeling, looking, and eating. Turns out, there’s more to these crunchy little bites than meets the eye.&lt;br data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When my editor asked me to commit to eating a serving of almonds daily for a week, I was all in, but I won’t pretend it felt second nature right away. If I am being completely honest, as much as I advocate for nuts as a healthy snack, consistency is not always my strong suit. With this challenge, though, I paid careful attention to the changes, big and small, that came from actually doing what I recommend to my clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Incorporating almonds into my routine felt a little clunky at first. There were days I forgot until late afternoon, and other times I just grabbed a handful alongside whatever else I was eating. Some days they were a mid-morning snack, other times I tossed them into salads or added them to oatmeal. The main goal was just to get them in, not to stress about timing or presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="8" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happened to my body when I ate almonds every day" data-anchor-id="what-happened-to-my-body-when-i-ate-almonds-every-day" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;What happened to my body when I ate almonds every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One of the first things I noticed by midweek was a genuine change in how full I felt throughout my day. Normally, I’m a bit of an opportunistic snacker, meaning I’ll grab whatever’s nearby, especially when the afternoon slump hits. With daily almonds, I found myself far less likely to go hunting for a bag of chips or an energy bar. Even a single serving (around 23 almonds) helped keep hunger pangs at bay, which surprised me with how much steadier my energy felt between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I didn’t experience a dramatic difference in my skin, despite the promising data on almond consumption and its link to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduced wrinkles and facial pigment intensity" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0"&gt;reduced wrinkles and facial pigment intensity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect these kinds of changes would require a longer-term commitment; a week simply may not be long enough to turn over a new leaf when it comes to your complexion. That said, I do believe the nutrients in almonds are doing beneficial work beneath the surface. I just can’t see the fruits of my labor yet! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Digestively, almonds didn’t cause me any issues, but the fiber content certainly helped keep things regular. If you’re not used to eating high-fiber foods, a sudden jump in almond intake could potentially leave you feeling a bit bloated or gassy, but for me, it was only a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What stood out the most, however, was the shift in my snacking behavior and my perception of fullness. Eating almonds daily made it easier to pass on less nutritious snacks. This wasn’t about strict self-discipline but more about not needing to battle cravings in the first place. They simply didn’t come on as strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;From a practical standpoint, almonds proved incredibly convenient. I didn’t need special preparation, refrigeration, or a plan to fit them into my days. This was key for me sticking to my goal of eating almonds every day, since my days can get a bit chaotic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The bottom line for my week-long experiment? While big, outward changes (like glowing skin) didn’t materialize in just seven days, the more subtle shifts in my appetite, digestion, and overall food choices were clear. It reminded me that sometimes the best nutrition habits are the ones that feel almost effortless once you start. Eating almonds every day nudged my body and mind toward healthier decisions without feeling like a chore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="health-benefits-of-eating-almonds" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-jpjoxu emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Health benefits of eating almonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s no surprise that almonds are a nutritional powerhouse. Packed with healthy fats, plant-based protein, and essential nutrients, they’ve earned their spot as a favorite among health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Rich in nutrients &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346393/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346393/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Just one ounce of almonds" data-node-id="18.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.0.0"&gt;Just one ounce of almonds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contains around 6 grams of protein, 14 grams of fat (primarily heart-healthy monounsaturated fats), and 3.5 grams of fiber. It packs a variety of vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin E (37% of the daily recommended intake) and magnesium (19% of the daily recommended intake).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant" data-node-id="19.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="19.0.0"&gt;Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in protecting your cells from oxidative damage.

Almonds are little nutrient superstars that pack a punch in the vitamin and mineral department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Supports heart health &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One of the most well-documented benefits of almonds is their impact on cardiovascular health.

Almonds are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high in healthy fats and dietary fiber" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;high in healthy fats and dietary fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are two factors that help promote longer-lasting fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Interestingly, research suggests that almonds may also slightly support metabolism, helping your &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201139/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201139/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body burn calories more efficiently" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="24.1.0"&gt;body burn calories more efficiently&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Not quite. But, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="some data suggest" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;some data suggest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that regular almond consumption might improve skin elasticity and reduce signs of aging over time. Results may vary depending on individual factors like genetics and duration of intake (like in my case—womp womp).

While I didn’t notice my skin turning into a radiant, glowing masterpiece worthy of its own Instagram filter (which I was SO hoping to see!), I did feel fuller, more satisfied, and less inclined to snack on junk food. And at the risk of giving TMI, I was very regular that week too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Would I recommend this? Absolutely. Whether you’re looking to improve satiety, support your heart, or just add more vitamins and minerals to your routine, almonds are worth the small effort it takes to include them. My biggest tip is to get creative! Add sliced almonds to your salad, mix them into oatmeal, or blend them into smoothies (really!!). And if you have a sweet tooth, try enjoying them dipped in chocolate. With so many easy ways to enjoy almonds, this is one healthy habit you’ll actually want to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:31:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNUjBhQVFLNk8wdFJuS1djN3JWeGtaVDV2dWVFSXgzY2pud3d2aHNpdGNHdlNzUF8xbjRaTjF6TnFrYUVxWjREdFczZHd6dlJjVExMdlp4NVVldHBscV9yanl3Q29TXzRGcEg0YWFuX2JKSUVVMGxydDZ2TGNycVE3U0tqRDh2UDdYYVE5YmUzajUtSTVaQkJPbG1CbnNXdFVoODZ2b2tfdVhxMFBUbHBQYg</guid></item><item><title>鸡肉阿尔弗雷多烘焙是终极高蛋白晚餐- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBFNjh6T01VM21vb01pakdCOEF5VHVWNDVuUmlsRlNXZnlmYzFxd2w2NFZWYWFqU0pUeG5rTHFDMXJ2OEViU1VOUHZRQmtxTWFzXzBnNi1nSEZ1VnpWYjlwN3NFVjEwUFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mm-recipes-intro__content_1-0" class="comp mm-recipes-intro__content mntl-sc-page mntl-block" data-sc-sticky-offset="190" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="1" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Why You’ll Love This Recipe" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

Protein-packed chicken bakes in a homemade Alfredo sauce made with a blend of cheeses, creamy half-and-half and aromatic onions and garlic. The sauce clings to the ridges in the whole-wheat penne while it bakes and is topped with more gooey, melty cheese. Garnish this crowd-pleasing casserole with fresh parsley for brightness and color.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These are the key tips we learned while developing and testing this recipe in our Test Kitchen to make sure it works, tastes great and is good for you too!

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be sure you don’t overcook the pasta when boiling; you want it to be just al dente, as it will continue to cook after being assembled. Also, remember to save your pasta water! It helps bind the sauce to the pasta, resulting in a much creamier texture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To enhance the flavor of this casserole, consider adding ingredients such as mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes or crushed red pepper. Including spinach would also provide a nice earthy touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To save on preparation time, we used a prepackaged, pre-shredded Italian cheese blend. However, shredding Asiago or Fontina cheese would also be a delicious option. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the Parmesan, we recommend grating it by hand rather than using a pre-grated variety.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Boneless, skinless &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030412/is-chicken-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chicken breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the main protein source in this dish. Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, as well as for helping you feel fuller after a meal. Chicken also contains B vitamins to keep your metabolism working efficiently, and choline for brain health. Choosing skinless chicken ensures you keep your saturated fat intake low. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing &lt;strong&gt;whole-wheat penne&lt;/strong&gt; over regular pasta helps you get more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber into your diet&lt;/a&gt;. Along with protein, fiber helps to slow digestion to keep you fuller for longer after a meal. Fiber is essential for good digestive health and for a healthy microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-garlic-841810" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garlic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is often overlooked as a healthy ingredient, but it’s high in antioxidant power. When you cut or crush garlic, like in this recipe, you release a compound called allicin, which has cancer-fighting and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;For eight months, a 35-year-old man in India was bothered by his left eye. It was red and blurry. When he finally visited an ophthalmology clinic, it didn't take long for doctors to unearth the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2502742"&gt;a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors report that they first noted that the eye was bloodshot and inflamed, and the pupil was dilated and fixed. The man's vision in the eye was 20/80. A quick look inside his eye revealed it was all due to a small worm, which they watched "moving sluggishly" in the back of his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gouge out the parasitic pillager, the doctors performed a pars plana vitrectomy—a procedure that involves sucking out some of the jelly-like vitreous inside the eye. This procedure can be used in the treatment of a variety of eye conditions, but using it to hoover up worms is rare. In order to get in, the doctors make tiny incisions in the white parts of the eye (the sclera) and use a hollow needle-like device with suction. They replace extracted eye jelly with things like saline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the device was able to suck in part of the worm's tail and drag it out—still squirming. Under the microscope, they quickly identified the peeper creeper. With a bulbous head, well-formed intestines, and a thick outer layer, it perfectly fit the description of &lt;em&gt;Gnathostoma spinigerum&lt;/em&gt;, a known bodily marauder that can sometimes wiggle its way into eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2111681 align-center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. spinigerum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are endemic parasites in India that infect carnivorous mammals, particularly wild and domestic cats and dogs. In these primary hosts, adult worms form tumor-like masses on the walls of the animals' intestinal tracts. There, the adults mate, and the mass erupts like an infernal, infectious volcano, spewing out eggs. The eggs are passed in the animals' feces and can then spread to intermediate hosts. These include freshwater plankton, which get eaten by fish and amphibians, which then get eaten by the cats and dogs to complete the cycle. The young parasites can also be taken up by dead-end hosts like birds, including chickens, and snakes—these are called paratenic hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

The recommended dietary allowance is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. That means a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds and who doesn’t exercise would need 53 grams of protein a day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As examples, 7 ounces of cooked chicken breast contains roughly 50 grams of protein, and so does 5.5 ounces of Greek yogurt eaten with 3 ounces of chicken breast. The American Heart Association says that most people, even athletes, can get enough protein by eating a serving of dairy for each of three meals in a day, plus a piece of meat the size of a deck of cards at lunch and supper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you get older, protein needs may increase, experts said. “Older adults slowly lose muscle mass, and there’s data suggesting it’s perhaps partially because they are less efficient at using dietary protein,” Trommelen noted. “It’s been suggested that older adults should consume up to 1.2 grams per kilogram of weight per day, up from the general recommendation of 0.36 grams, although this is still a topic of debate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have You Considered The Rest Of Your Diet? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may also want to consider what other nutrients might help your body do its best.

For adolescent and premenopausal females, iron is also a shortfall nutrient. Nutritionists are especially concerned about four nutrients — fiber, calcium, vitamin D and potassium. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Avoid Protein-Related Visceral Fat, Try Strength Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of us aren’t engaging in lifestyles that will help us absorb protein in the most efficient way possible. If you want more muscle growth, you’ll need extra strength training, not extra protein. Mozaffarian said that you’ve got to be working out on the regular for protein to be able to make a difference. “Eating more protein is valuable when people are engaged in a regular program of strength training and when they’re working out several times per week, where it helps build muscle mass and strength.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trommelen agreed, saying: “Physical activity, especially resistance exercise, greatly enhances the body’s use of dietary protein.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also true that since the body can’t store protein, amounts that are more than your body needs end up being used for energy or stored as fat. “Without a regular program of strength training, eating more protein has little health value,” Mozaffarian said. “Just eating more protein alone won’t build muscle. In fact, excess dietary protein is converted to visceral fat, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. That’s because when protein intake is high, insulin rises, just like it does with starch or sugar intakes. In studies across the world, people who have the highest levels of protein actually have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522031902" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="higher risk of diabetes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522031902" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;higher risk of diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Sources Of Protein &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you want to build muscle mass, engage in a regular program of strength training or resistance exercise, and focus on healthy food sources of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Otherwise, emphasize a generally healthy diet, and rather than being obsessed with protein, seek out minimally processed fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, plant oils, fish and yogurt. Avoid soda, candy, processed meat and ultraprocessed foods high in starch, sugar or salt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Focus on the food source and its overall impact on your health, rather than the grams of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Avoid processed meats, ultraprocessed foods like protein bars and protein powders. Protein-rich foods with evidence for general health benefits include fish, shellfish, yogurt, cheese and milk. Legumes, grains and nuts also provide protein and substantial health benefits. Unprocessed red meats are OK in moderation, up to two servings per week.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head For The Produce Aisle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

That’s a way of eating that lowers your risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer — and it gives you all the protein you need, without even trying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNQ1gyUDZFOTNDY0NpYVVvMVVGOE94bmJORmd5ZGF4aXFCM0xaWFZqUEFTNGRDVFhPLWhWbmptRXR5SzZybXVOVHZuOGpmb0l5clQzdnBfWXY3VXp6T3lTeXB3MGN4ZU9xa0hPZU5rQTFEUGlMZEVfUlN3ZzlHeGk2Qy1CY3RWd9IBiwFBVV95cUxQamhzZUQ1NnRQeFFKX1MxMUVxUG5CSUphQmlVaTRnU2x2NzBKOWNaWGdiS2UtaURVbG0zSTZycG5iRHRRTjB2NUVCejREbzZXMmlDVkp2MThyWGsyVnJvX18za1RrVER6cUQyYU41YjBIbE5UQ1hIUFR6QVFUUnQxNjBjMjNuUXBMWTRR</guid></item><item><title>为什么您在旅行时应该尝试“陆上浮潜” —在家里- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPSmxWUThMazN1dDFXQm5DWThnR2Q0eWxCS0hHLTdOQnZWQnJWWmZOWU9ScjBuWEo1TEJPSGhiQ1NOZ1Vpek56ZjdZc0g3LV9PWUtCaFBwTkdEbUhNUUhkZHpvYlNEQk10Q3JNZEw2RFlEUWo4M3pOYjdCaFpaZ2xnN2Y0NTdlbTdpRjl1dDdCWdIBlAFBVV95cUxNT3hDVGZpVmpGRFpPbjlJdGR2QkpDcEM3NU9aSnpsUURqYm5TZUkyYnp2ejF5TElBaTZiNUpCcTdLN0RCbXpIdjdqQ05nb2pRbTBncHl3STBDSjdkM3IwS0QtbTJMdkxzdzVpbmJtR2daYXBPTXBHNEFvZ3UwOVNXWm9FbUNieThURW1Ic3VMVDJMWE4y?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jomo-travel-vacation-tourism_l_67ec9390e4b049e10922615a" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="JOMO trips" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67ec9390e4b049e10922615a" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;JOMO trips&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/blue-mind-theory-travel_l_689135e4e4b0eacd23de3fc2" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“blue mind theory” vacations" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="689135e4e4b0eacd23de3fc2" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;“blue mind theory” vacations&lt;/a&gt;, there are seemingly endless trends in the travel zeitgeist these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another one with a particularly fun name is “land snorkeling” ― a fresh mindset that invites travelers to explore cities and neighborhoods with the kind of curiosity and awareness they bring to floating through a coral reef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is land snorkeling, and how might it guide your next vacation? HuffPost asked a couple of travel experts to break down the benefits, downsides and tips for taking this approach to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Artur Debat via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Artur Debat via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Land snorkeling is about giving all your surroundings the same attention you'd pay to a coral reef while floating in the water. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is land snorkeling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Land snorkeling is the idea of exploring a place slowly and intentionally, like you’re ‘snorkeling’ through a neighborhood or city,” travel blogger &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/estherelsewhere/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Esther Susag" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/estherelsewhere/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Esther Susag&lt;/a&gt; told HuffPost. “It’s that meandering, no-itinerary-needed way of discovering hidden gems, whether you’re wandering a quiet neighborhood, checking out a local market or stumbling across a tucked-away coffee shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to take it slow and appreciate the space around you when you’re traveling or even when you’re in your own hometown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of racing from one must-see to the next, you’re taking a page from the underwater playbook ― drifting, noticing, tuning in,” said &lt;a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us/newsroom/our-people" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Leigh Barnes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us/newsroom/our-people" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Leigh Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, president of Americas at Intrepid Travel. “Just like floating through a reef lets you take in the colors and textures up close, land snorkeling is about appreciating the small stuff: the sound of a local conversation, the smell of street food sizzling, the way the light hits a building. It’s presence, not just sightseeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits? Any downsides?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to opt for this slow, immersive approach to travel and everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I love about it is how grounded it feels,” Susag said. “You end up discovering hole-in-the-wall bakeries, chatting with locals or stumbling into a park you never would’ve planned for. It brings back that sense of wonder that sometimes gets lost in overplanned trips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes believes &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-slow-travel-vacation_l_63ea5c31e4b0063ccb27b668" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="slow travel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63ea5c31e4b0063ccb27b668" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;slow travel&lt;/a&gt; trends like land snorkeling are better for the planet and for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s jumping on a scenic train, joining a walking tour with a local guide, or staying in a homestay that gives back to the community ― you get more out of your travels when you go deeper, not faster,” he said. “It helps ease burnout, brings you back to the moment, and supports the people and places you visit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that slowing down helps you reconnect with yourself, others and the earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only downside is that it’s not always the most time-efficient way to see a city, especially if you’re on a tight schedule,” Susag noted. “But if you’ve got a few days and want to feel a place rather than just visit it, it’s amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way to try out land snorkeling on your next trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold on the idea of land snorkeling but don’t know where to begin? Just start simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you arrive somewhere new, walk instead of jumping in a car,” Barnes advised. “Ditch the big bucket-list blitz and choose a few experiences that really matter. And give yourself permission to wander ― without a plan, without your phone, and without rushing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that you can even start with a small group tour and let a guide handle the logistics of your day so that you can stay present and curious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to give land snorkeling a try, pick a neighborhood, leave your phone in your pocket and just start walking,” Susag said. “Walk with no real goal, chat with locals, follow your curiosity and don’t be afraid to take a few wrong turns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to commit to a full land-snorkeling vacation, either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The trial of new food items often accounts for hilarious moments. This viral clip captures the same in the cutest way. The video shows a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy trying a strawberry for the first time. However, trying to eat the fruit ends up becoming a playful struggle for the little one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever puppy’s first time eating strawberry makes for adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a user, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bhootu_the_samoyed/?e=f2942643-37b3-403a-8118-951f37f20834&amp;amp;g=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:@bhootu_the_samoyed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;@bhootu_the_samoyed&lt;/a&gt;, took to Instagram to share an adorable post about their dog named Chomchom. The profile is dedicated to the pup’s endless adventures with his &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/samoyed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samoyed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samoyed&lt;/a&gt; brother, Bhootu. In the Instagram Reel, the Golden tries out a strawberry for the very first time. However, the furbaby realizes that eating the fruit isn’t an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video begins with the Golden Retriever puppy asking if fans want to see how he ate his first strawberry. His owner delivers the fruit on the floor to make it easier for the puppy to explore it. The furball tries to eat it, finding it extremely delicious. However, Chomchom struggles to get the strawberry in his mouth. It keeps slipping away whenever he tries to grab it. This leaves the canine frustrated and restless, but he refuses to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He uses his paws and mouth to grab the fruit. Since Chomchom is a puppy, it is natural for him to find it a little difficult to grab a new food item. After multiple attempts, the Golden succeeds in getting the strawberry as he swiftly taps his paw on it.

There were more than 7,000 cases of the virus recorded by officials as of Wednesday (August 13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were mostly in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Foshan, which is about 105 miles (170km) from &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/hong-kong?pageNumber=3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number of new cases appears to be dropping slowly, according to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to be the largest chikungunya outbreak ever recorded in China, according to Cesar Lopez-Camacho from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "What makes this event notable is that chikungunya has never been established in mainland China before. This suggests most of the population had no pre-existing immunity, making it easier for the virus to spread quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 10:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNOFdrVko5WnF5RHNqWFhPVXpLVDdMalIzM19ia1VtZXFfd3NEeU5oZjlaa1AzTHNRLXpZS29YNEVQcGRTUHgxZm1KYjJkSkRNaGJtQnNnclBiXzNOWWFob2VUNThEUVA0VEJIdUtib0tQRWdCUDlrWEdQQThVcElRRUcydHZSSDBJMEIxaFlDZTBWZVXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTmdpd1RhSWVFS2kzYkUyRVAyMjJuUWtxV3FGaFU3b3AtUklFQ3ViSE56dFhPR3M5dkF4Tl9HUkJaQ1N1R2lmbC1uaUk3UTk0djJDRGRaUjhDeFJnQU9VRmx2VzJZZ1Z1QkJKSlM2TnVHVXJ1RGt6TlBHenlSWnlmWFVnbVVyUU9wWURWQTNpbm50VGdfdHNreEg</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：女孩的牙齿问题导致危及生命的眼部感染- Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNYXN3Um9yQ0tFZUxjNThDelRMSVFVOG11QTdOcEpScTlWUjJhenFJYnpqVWJPOXdhc2NicjM0SkstT3NST25FWXhmQVdoNEFjZGQ0VHNFZ1JzOEVnZnZzR2Q4VTFSdExvX2VLWGhXMldId2Z3UUktbmUxT3c2bnJpdXhCTnpNeWxCUDdLLVNsTDRpLWYtRjBEY3o1OA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="ad69810c-35f0-4fac-8941-c0ddf400cd54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 6-year-old girl in the West Bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The girl was brought to her primary dentist because she had a toothache near her back-right molars, along with a headache, swelling around her right eye, and a fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). She received &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/how-does-tylenol-work" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/how-does-tylenol-work"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to reduce her temperature and oral antibiotics to fight the infection, but the swelling worsened. Following two episodes of vomiting, she was admitted to a hospital pediatric ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad69810c-35f0-4fac-8941-c0ddf400cd54-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; Doctors gave the patient intravenous antibiotics, including vancomycin, which is often used for hard-to-treat bacterial infections, including those caused by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/10-of-the-deadliest-superbugs-that-scientists-are-worried-about" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/10-of-the-deadliest-superbugs-that-scientists-are-worried-about"&gt;&lt;u&gt;methicillin-resistant &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA). Her condition did not improve. The eye began to bulge from the socket, and she developed double vision and light sensitivity. She could move this eye only a little, and the area around it was severely swollen, shiny, flushed and warm to the touch. Her left eye was also mildly swollen, but she could still freely move that eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fa8116e6-9fa2-4174-962a-7f8b4c73c0e2"&gt;A CT scan of the patient's head showed that her right sinus cavities were so inflamed that they appeared opaque on the scan. A closer look revealed swollen tissues that displaced fat layers around the eye. There was also an accumulation of pus in the eye socket — known as a subperiosteal abscess, doctors wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-025-05575-5" target="_blank" data-url="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-025-05575-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Ophthalmologists determined that the girl's eye swelling was caused by a bacterial infection known as orbital cellulitis, which affects fat and muscle tissues around the eye but not the eye itself. It can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels and nerves in the eye. If untreated, the infection can spread to the bloodstream or brain, leading to life-threatening complications. The doctors determined that bacteria had migrated from the patient's original infection in her teeth to her sinuses, and had then spread to her eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1072879406347187307&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-62606-2_1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgirls-dental-trouble-caused-a-life-threatening-eye-infection" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-62606-2_1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-62606-2_1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgirls-dental-trouble-caused-a-life-threatening-eye-infection" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prior to 1985&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, orbital cellulitis was commonly linked to the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenza&lt;/em&gt;. Since the development of a vaccine for &lt;em&gt;H. influenza&lt;/em&gt; type b, however, orbital cellulitis is usually caused by &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (also known as staph) and various species of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Because&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;orbital cellulitis can cause blindness and other dangerous complications, the doctors surgically removed the abscess to relieve the pressure on the patient's eye. Several days later, surgeons operated again and extracted two infected teeth: the first and second molars on the right side. They created a drainage opening in the patient's sinuses and removed several polyps that had formed in her sinus cavity. She continued to receive intravenous antibiotics, and her condition quickly improved. At a follow-up visit eight months later, her eye appeared normal, with no loss of vision or mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aJyxK9CjTTWrb7zPzVxbjm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aJyxK9CjTTWrb7zPzVxbjm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="b0a14389-4408-4285-985a-e6792923648b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Orbital cellulitis is much less common than periorbital cellulitis, a superficial eye infection that typically only affects the skin around the eye. In a study that reviewed 10 years of data from children hospitalized for eye infections, orbital cellulitis made up only 17% of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, about 90% of orbital cellulitis cases stem from sinus infections, and the condition is very rarely caused by dental issues. To date, only four such examples have been described in the medical literature, according to the report authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-aJyxK9CjTTWrb7zPzVxbjm-J8gg5o3kq8m1Y4vRbkCeVjBI4Y6LFIBp" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-aJyxK9CjTTWrb7zPzVxbjm-J8gg5o3kq8m1Y4vRbkCeVjBI4Y6LFIBp slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Louisiana accounts for a disproportionate share of the cases, with 20 infections and four deaths. In comparison, the state averaged just seven cases and one death per year over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Experts point to several factors fueling the recent increase, including rising water temperatures and storm runoff that provides nutrients for bacterial growth. While the bacterium can sometimes enter the body through eating raw or undercooked seafood, the Louisiana Department of Health reports that three-quarters of recent infections involved wounds or other direct water exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ideal conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm, brackish waters — conditions that are common during the summer months. After heavy rains and storms, nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen wash into coastal waters, helping the bacteria multiply, said Tiong Aw, a public health microbiologist and professor at Tulane University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"All these create an ideal condition for Vibrio to grow and survive," Aw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are dozens of types of Vibrio bacteria, and they can live in temperatures as low as 50 degrees. But they especially like the warm conditions of the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/36/8/JCLI-D-22-0409.1.xml" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Climate found that water temperatures in the Gulf have risen at twice the rate of global ocean temperatures between 1970 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the oceans have gotten warmer in recent years, it’s not surprising that cases are increasing,” said Dr. David Mushatt, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University. “Temperature and salt content are what these bacteria like.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;h3&gt;A dangerous infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus enters the body either through an open wound exposed to contaminated water or by consuming raw shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating raw or undercooked contaminated oysters causes gastrointestinal illness and, in severe cases, a bloodstream infection. That form is not a skin-destroying infection, but it can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection can also occur when Vibrio vulnificus gains access through a break in the skin. Someone shucking raw oysters with a cut, for example, can be exposed if the bacteria invade the wound. It can also enter through injuries sustained in or near the water, such as scraping a leg on a boat, or from any existing wound that comes into contact with contaminated seawater.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, it multiplies rapidly and releases toxins that kill cells and break down tissue, causing severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a "rare but very serious infection," said Dr. Norman Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida. Most cuts exposed to seawater will heal normally, he said, but certain warning signs can signal the infection has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hallmark sign is the appearance of blisters, known as bullae, near the infected wound, and a rapid onset of swelling and redness, Beatty said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Often, a delay in getting to a doctor who could prescribe antibiotics allows the infection to progress, sometimes requiring surgical removal of infected tissue or even amputation, said Beatty. Severe cases can lead to sepsis and septic shock, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a cut while in the water, Mushatt suggested cleaning it right away with hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic ointment. But don’t wait if the wound starts turning red, swelling or oozing pus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can progress over hours,” Mushatt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting off going to the emergency room until your vacation is over is not the right choice. Even a three-hour drive back home from the beach could make a difference in the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t want to wait that long,” said Mushatt, who recommended seeking care at a local ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with liver disease, diabetes or weakened immune systems should be especially cautious. “For these individuals, the threshold to seek care is even lower,” Dr. Mushatt added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small number linked to raw oysters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of recent infections have been linked to eating raw oysters, according to LDH, and no single harvesting area has been identified as a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Watts, a seafood extension specialist at LSU AgCenter, emphasized that eating raw shellfish always carries some risk, especially from April through October when the bacteria is most active. She advised consumers to look for oysters labeled safe for raw consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Certain groups, including pregnant people, older adults, those with weakened immune systems, and individuals with liver disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or undergoing chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive treatments, should avoid raw shellfish altogether to reduce their risk of serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no specific state or federal program testing coastal waters for Vibrio vulnificus, said Aw. However, Aw’s lab has been monitoring Lake Pontchartrain for the last year and found the bacteria present year-round, with higher levels during summer when water temperatures reach about 86 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 75 to 85 percent of Americans experience back pain at some point during their lifetimes, while 25million currently suffer from lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors normally treat the pain, which can be caused by sprains, arthritis and traumatic injuries, with over-the-counter painkillers, physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients have also been offered talk therapy since 2017, with doctors referring some patients for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With CBT, patients attempt to reconceptualize their pain in order to reduce it. Pain reductions from this tend to be short-lived, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, scientists recruited patients who had been suffering from moderate back pain who said it limited their day-to-day activities, such as causing them to move slowly or struggle to pick up heavy objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were 47 years old on average, overweight and said they had been seeking care for the pain for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were asked to attend 20 clinics in Perth and Sydney, Australia, to receive treatment between October 2018 and August 2020 and split into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first received CFT, the second received CFT plus biofeedback, where sensors are used to map movements, and the third received typical care, or followed the care plan recommended by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in both CFT groups attended seven treatment sessions over three months and a booster session at six months. Each session lasted 60 minutes and was led by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of adults aged 18 and over with any form of pain. Back pain is the most common form of pain in the US, the figures suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the CFT sessions, participants were first encouraged to share the story of their pain to help them understand their discomfort and its underlying causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then guided through movements and activities that they previously said were painful, feared or avoided, to help them learn how to manage the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the sessions, patients also received lifestyle guidance on healthy habits such as the need for regular physical activity, improved sleep, diet and regular socializing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the initial study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00441-5/abstract"&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/a&gt;, all participants had a moderate level of disability from back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years later, however, in the groups that received CFT this had dropped to and remained at a mild level of disability, when back pain causes some limitations but does not impair overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with mild impairment may be able to walk around with little difficulty but can still struggle to lift heavy objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant difference between the groups that received CFT only and those that received CFT and biofeedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the group continuing typical care, however, people still experienced a moderate level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Participants who received CFT still reported significant improvements in pain three years later (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A moderate level of disability suggests participants can move only a short distance before requiring a break and can still perform basic daily activities like dressing or cooking but may take longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was first revealed in 2023 but was republished again this month with updated data from three years after the study began, showing that the therapy could reduce pain for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists said CFT boosted participants' movement and reduced their pain because it reduced their fear of certain actions that had caused pain and made them less likely to avoid these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the course was also carried out by trained therapists and had a booster session six months later, which ensured patients got better training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest paper, the researchers said: 'CFT produces clinically important effects for activity limitation at three-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These long-term effects are novel and provide the opportunity to markedly reduce the effect of chronic back pain if the intervention can be widely implemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:58:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生分享了10种模仿Ozempic的日常食物，让减肥变得更容易|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-10-daily-foods-that-mimic-ozempic-and-make-weight-loss-easier-101754996660582.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ozempic is not just a celebrity buzzword! It is a prescription drug originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, now widely talked about for its surprising weight loss effects. This buzz has sparked curiosity about whether there are natural alternatives to Ozempic. The answer is yes! Dr Adrian, a functional medicine doctor and MD specializing in thyroid, PCOS, and gut health, recently shared on Instagram a list of foods that may work in a similar way. These foods can help boost GLP-1, the hormone that curbs unnecessary hunger and helps control appetite, supporting a healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/12/550x309/ozempic_1754997191624_1754997201343.jpg" alt="Try these foods to naturally boost GLP-1 levels!

(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is the brand name for semaglutide, a medication created by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk. It belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, meaning it imitates the effects of a hormone your body naturally produces, GLP-1. First approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for managing type 2 diabetes, Ozempic comes as a once-weekly injection, usually given in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm using a prefilled pen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How does GLP-1 support weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 is an incretin hormone released in your gut after you eat. Health Shots also got in touch with dietitian Vidhi Chawla to learn more about it. She says, “It triggers more insulin, curbs glucagon (which raises blood sugar), and slows digestion, all of which help keep blood sugar stable and reduce appetite.” That is why Ozempic is effective for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Foods to boost GLP-1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 foods that may help make weight loss feel easier and quicker with an Ozempic prescription:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with healthy monounsaturated fats and fibre, avocados keep hunger hormones in check. Dr Adrian notes that their slow-digesting fat content supports steady blood sugar, while the fibre helps keep you feeling full for longer. A study published in Nutrients revealed that eating a whole avocado can boost GLP-1 levels, along with reducing cravings and appetite. This food is also rich in potassium, which supports metabolism and slows down digestion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny seeds are a powerhouse of soluble fibre. When soaked, they form a gel in your stomach that slows digestion, much like Ozempic delays gastric emptying (the rate at which food moves from the stomach to the small intestine). Vidhi Chawla adds that chia seeds are also a good plant-based omega-3 source, supporting gut health and reducing inflammation linked to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often misunderstood, potatoes (especially boiled or baked) are among the most satiating foods that can support weight loss. They provide slow-digesting carbs that keep energy stable. Dr Adrian points out that their resistant starch content feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which may indirectly support weight control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Oats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, particularly rolled oats, are rich in beta-glucan, a soluble fibre that triggers fullness hormones. They are a steady energy source that reduces the risk of unwanted hunger. Vidhi recommends starting your day with oatmeal paired with protein, like Greek yogurt, for even better hunger control. According to her, fibre rich foods help reduce your calorie intake by promoting the feeling of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/08/original/AdobeStock_109115874_1746692663218.jpeg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Oats can support weight loss!(Adobe Stock)" title="Oats can support weight loss!(Adobe Stock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Oats can support weight loss!(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Eggs and egg whites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are loaded with protein that lowers ghrelin, the "I'm hungry" hormone. Their amino acids also support muscle maintenance during weight loss. Having them at breakfast can help curb appetite for hours, making them a simple yet effective tool in any weight-loss-friendly diet. So, make sure you start your day with a protein and fibre-rich breakfast to support weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Greek Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thick, creamy, and protein-rich, Greek yogurt is digested slowly, keeping you satisfied for longer. Its probiotic content supports gut health, which is linked to better weight management. Dr Adrian advises choosing unsweetened versions to avoid unnecessary sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Lean meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From skinless chicken to turkey, lean meats deliver high-quality protein that boosts metabolism due to the thermic effect of food. This means you burn more calories even when digesting food. Vidhi notes that protein also helps prevent the muscle loss often seen in rapid weight loss, keeping metabolism healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines offer both protein and omega-3 fats. Dr Adrian says this combo reduces inflammation, balances hormones, and suppresses appetite. Eating fish 2–3 times a week can be a game-changer for promoting both satiety and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low in sugar but high in fibre, berries are ideal for controlling blood sugar spikes. Their antioxidants also help reduce inflammation, which can interfere with hunger and satiety signals. Vidhi suggests pairing berries with Greek yogurt for a balanced, filling snack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, broccoli, and other fibre-rich vegetables are filling yet low in calories. They fill your stomach, stimulate fullness hormones, and deliver vitamins that support overall metabolic function, explains Dr Adrian. One 2022 study published in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine found that eating vegetables before carbohydrates significantly improves glucose and GLP-1 levels in people with type 2 diabetes. What's more? Since they are also high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, they can also help support healthy metabolism and the fat-burning process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:38:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“便秘导致的记忆丧失” ： 79种可能改变你看待自己的方式的野生人体怪癖-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV0FVX3lxTE0zcE9SaUN4eFdYQnhjTFRPVWNEMzdkRGZNaFRsTk45ek4tbDkwMXgyLXRaV3dSOE54eXZ1enFjMnNDaE5SaDdRWThhRzhMTWdxVmszOEZGOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-items clearfix "&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161335"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161335" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm not a medical person but my mum was a midwife before she retired. She told me about the septum primum and has always referred to it as the most amazing thing about human development that continues to blow her mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, it's a valve in the heart that develops when in the womb. It allows blood to bypass the lungs, which are too immature and the mother's blood supplies oxygen needs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's remarkable is that when the baby is delivered and draws its first breath, the change in pressure in the circulatory system causes the valve to shut, cutting off the blood flow from the mother and allowing oxygenated blood from the lungs to pass through the heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not in medicine so may have explained that a little wrong - perhaps someone can correct me.&lt;/span&gt;

If you suddenly cannot see, typically you're fine because your brain can sense that you've got two feet on the ground, thus it can use the weight on two feet to determine the best way to keep you upright. (and why you become disoriented in a tunnel with spinning lights)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If; however, you lift one leg with your eyes closed, then your body needs to find out a way to know where you're at. So...you'll start feeling the nerves in the ankle that is touching the ground begin to fire in a sort of pattern around your ankle. your body is using a patterned out of balance means to determine where balance is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also, nothing is real time. there are fractions of a second between when you touch something and when your brain says you've touched it. therefore, even as you type, your fingers are actually touching the keys before your brain is registering it. you're brain is typing in the past but anticipating for the future. Also, doing things that require minutely fine timing (like releasing a baseball) become even more complex because your hand must release the ball at a very precise time to get it to its target. Your brain has to anticipate this tiny amount of lag because you're fingers don't react the instant the brain says let go. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciw98fy/" target="_blank"&gt; destin325 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/low-section-woman-standing-land_120961953.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=34&amp;amp;uuid=4d54811e-3b90-4e4d-9baf-bf8ac36e3bce&amp;amp;query=leg+step" target="_blank"&gt; EyeEm/Freepik (Not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-12/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161314"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161314" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The coolest thing in medschool I learnt was about Eagle Syndrome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you have these two pointy, bony spikes behind your jaw called your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_styloid_process#mediaviewer/File:Processus_styloideus_(close)_with_label.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;styloid processes&lt;/a&gt;.They are there as an anchor point for many ligaments including some from your tongue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In some people the styloid processes are too long and it begins to compress on your carotid arteries leading up from your neck to your head.

Throw something behind you, close your eyes, listen for the sound, and turn towards it without opening your eyes. Then check how close your were to looking directly at the location of the object. Usually, you will be extremely accurate, although practice can improve the accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your eyes: You were born with blue eyes, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun turned them to whatever colour they are now (or didn't, depending on your genetics: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080130170343.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;blue-eyed people are technically part-albino mutants&lt;/a&gt;, with a certain protein "turned off" in their eyes, which stops melanin production, and forces your eyes to stay albino-blue). They use up about 90% of the average person's daily sensory input, and the muscles in them flex and relax so constantly that it would be the leg muscle equivalent of walking about 50 miles a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most interesting, I think, however, is your skin. The interesting part doesn't come from the skin itself, though, it's how dangerous life would be without it. You see, your skin is made of several layers, the top few layers (epidermis) giving it the colour that it needs for optimal survival. The basal layer of the epidermis is technically the only "living" layer (receiving oxygen), producing cells that are basically just nuclei and sacs of melanin, the size and distribution of which give your skin colour. These cells rapidly decompose until the only thing left is a sac of melanin. Here's the cool part, though: your skin is always, always, ALWAYS adjusting the amount and distribution of melanin. Were it not doing that, you would begin to suffer from UV radiation poisoning almost immediately (resulting in widespread burns across the body and general nausea, dizziness, and the other symptoms associated with sun poisoning). Yet, if we had too MUCH melanin, we would not get enough sunlight (Vitamin D) and would become very sick as well. Therefore, the closer you are to the equator, or the more you are out in sunlight, the more melanin you have. But as you travel away from the equator or stay inside, your body needs to gather as much sunlight as possible to keep up vitamin D levels, so it reduces the melanin in your skin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciwpagk/" target="_blank"&gt; moonshinejester &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/shot-beautiful-young-businesswoman-wearing-blue-chifon-shirt-while-standing-street-with-folded-arms_10284656.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=8&amp;amp;uuid=4cb8dcff-e63e-4ca5-99ab-d37b1dd1e0fb&amp;amp;query=standing+woman" target="_blank"&gt; ArthurHidden/Freepik (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-69/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161389"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161389" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/human-body-facts-14-689b07016c705__700.jpg" alt="Woman enjoying sunlight outdoors, highlighting surprising body quirks that may change how you see yourself." title="Woman enjoying sunlight outdoors, highlighting surprising body quirks that may change how you see yourself."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I know a couple of fun ones. When we undergo cellular respiration the waste product is CO2. When we lose weight the extra weight is being breathed out. Plants take that CO2 and can turn it into wood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes when people suffer facial injuries the nerves can get crossed when they try to repair themselves. This can result in crying whenever somebody smells something delicious instead of salivating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human heart pumps the equivalent volume of the entire blood supply in 60-90 seconds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people with severe coronary disease develop a transverse crease (Frank's sign).

Inside your ear, there's these two sacs above the cochlea (which is the weird snail shell inside your head allowing you to hear) called otolithic organs because they literally contain rocks. You have rocks inside of your head that tell you how your head is positioned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sacs are lined with gel. In that gel, there are tiny hairs that are connected to nerves. On top of the gel, there's a crystal called an otolith. Now, when you tilt your head backwards, the crystal moves because gravity's pulled it backwards. The crystal moves the gel underneath it, and the gel in turn moves the hair cells.

The entirety of the pelvic organ structure is held up by muscular and ligamentous attachments. This is by design to permit childbirth. Most women return to a normal pelvic floor architecture without any special exercising or effort.

Our bodies are amazing and depending on your personal beliefs, one can either say that we are fearfully and wonderfully made or Mother nature has really outdone herself and will continue to do so through natural selection. Some of my favorites:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Images we see are formed upside down on our retina. Our brains convert the images received to the normal upright positions which we see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Acid base physiology. Our blood maintains a strict pH of 7.35-7.45 and has some precise mechanisms to maintain it. The Henderson- Hasselbach equation is the equation of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Neuronal plasticity. The brain is able to train different parts to adapt to new functions if needed. This poorly understood mechanism if well researched and understood will only push the borders of what we are able to do for patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The right side of your brain controls the left side of your body and vice versa.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciw9b9p/" target="_blank"&gt; Verapamil123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/portrait-smiley-woman-posing-outdoors_11767783.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=22&amp;amp;uuid=421b6a67-abed-4248-8f13-d3dc713e8819&amp;amp;query=woman" target="_blank"&gt; Freepik (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161374"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161374" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/human-body-facts-32-689b0f6a14d58__700.jpg" alt="Person in wheelchair with a bandaged amputated leg showing surprising body quirks and unique physical traits." title="Person in wheelchair with a bandaged amputated leg showing surprising body quirks and unique physical traits."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm not a medical person, but the concept of 'Phantom Limbs' is really interesting. Basically if you've had an amputation of some sort, the body experiences this phantom pain which feels as though the amputated part is still there and that you are still able to move it.

A human may have more muscle than a chimp, but the chimp will activate a higher percent of muscle for the same kind of motion. As a result of heightened muscle control, humans are "better" at finer motor skills, which sacrifices the muscle power seen in primates. (Think of humans as a fine handling sports car, whereas primates are a super-charged diesel.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**TL;DR** apes are stronger than humans because their muscles activate in a way that sacrifices the fine motor skills that allowed humans to evolve. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciwbuzp/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-52/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161359"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161359" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;You can make someone vomit by squirting ice cold water into their ears.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciwafy9/" target="_blank"&gt; 5679brma &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-61/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161369"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161369" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Saliva is mostly made of mucus.

I will contribute something most people didn't know or think about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a blood vessel is blocked, say like in a stroke, your body tries it's hardest to compensate for it. It will even branch vessels around the part that is circulating poorly. As in, it will force and grow around it to establish flow through the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May not sound like much, but this always amazed me.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciw8l1m/" target="_blank"&gt; punkbenRN &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161307"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161307" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;As long as there is not significant blood loss taking place (no arteries are damaged), and the circulatory system is working, the human body can survive a s**t tone of punishment for a very long time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciw5d0f/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161348"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161348" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Close one eye and stare at a point in space.

Your plumbing is dynamic. Even at rest, your arteries have what's called, "vascular tone," which keeps them in a somewhat tense and constricted state (all arteries have at least some circumferential muscle in their walls, the contraction of which allows for squeezing the arterial walls inward and reducing the lumen of the vessel). If I snapped my fingers and removed this influence on all the blood vessels, well, default is relaxation. Your blood pressure would drop expeditiously and you wouldn't last too much longer after that (without medical care, that is).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2aktzu/medical_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_favourite/ciwtjg4/" target="_blank"&gt; mikepjr &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10078-122/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9161430"&gt;  &lt;p id="9161430" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;People can't see far away (myopic) because their eyes a too long and thus the cornea/lens system is focusing their light in the middle of the eye.
