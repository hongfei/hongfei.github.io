    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy neck circumference to waist circumference ratio is generally considered to be less than 0.5; meaning your waist circumference should be less than twice your neck circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AFib is associated with an increased risk of death and can potentially shorten lifespan. A 2018 study found people with Afib had an up to four times increased risk of mortality compared to the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While modern treatments have improved outcomes, AFib still carries a significant risk, particularly due to complications like stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For measurement of neck circumference, participants were instructed to stand straight with the measuring tape around the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both neck and waist circumference were measured to the nearest quarter inch. Standardized protocols were used to measure height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a larger neck circumference is a proxy for excess upper body subcutaneous fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of fat, particularly in the upper body, can be a major source of circulating free fatty acids in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increased levels of free fatty acids are linked with insulin resistance and an imbalance of lipids in the blood, which can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Boston University found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study out of Israel in 2019 presented similar findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis included 302 patients with the average age being around 62 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the participants' height was accounted for, they found a high neck circumference 'significantly correlated with poor long-term outcome'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the complaints they found among the subjects with thicker necks included diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found the risk of these ailments was 2.3 times higher for those with larger neck circumferences compared to those with slimmer necks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2022 study by researchers based out of Shanghai found that neck circumference was 'significantly associated' with the risk of future cardiovascular events in middle-aged and elderly populations and was a better predictor in men.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers enrolled 1,435 participants aged 50 to 80 years from communities in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high neck circumference was defined as more than 15 inches in men and over 13 inches in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers employed various methods to explore the association between neck circumference and cardiovascular events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years, 148 cardiovascular events occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that for every one standard deviation increase in neck circumference, individuals in the study population were 1.45 times more likely to experience a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke compared to those with a lower neck circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conclude that neck circumference is 'a new measurement index that is simple, saves time, has little variability, and can reflect upper-body fat content'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:07:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOR00zN1I2TTFvWENHMTduLWhLdU1HUWI2WjJOa01LMENzS3Z6azVHUkVyQjB1S0dzMGtld3ZEVWpTYS1HVkZmT2FSTUp4MWVlb3RGNGhJTnN4dVpuTDVSNjhxR1dPb2FFUV90cWFXZkwtdk84aktFRjlrWmNGYkpfaGJkZU5jRm5SZDlzLXVWZ0lBM0RSZENfeWp30gGfAUFVX3lxTE9wV3UwZS10YVBDcjRSbU1GbTd2dXJYQjRVeVlKMGZYNUtQVHN1dHBTWUZmelpyb3Z1REU0cmdyMkV2SUxSS004cUpoR0pjbG9aWVBIVTZ1QWMwcHV4UWxrZmVwcC0zT3FPOG5DZ0ViVTNYWTRnUzVKY1kyNjc1TVZsUnlma01uVk1nS2NiMlAwV2V6RmtRT0dueFlXUDVfTQ</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州宣布麻疹疫情结束-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNY01oaEJIajFzVlp5SmUxRkptWkNiQUt5c1hJNFF6NnpabkFMOVEya200ME85Vjk1VzlqdUNHQ216ajJwYW05QlVQTkV5cmx0YmRJTVBpbWdGcTZwY3NIeDZ2cW1qc3hQR1B0aTFMVDB4SXQwN3ZJUHVDM0NZNk94UDdRZHllWi1Semd4LXNPNTc3bG82UzR4dVh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNY01oaEJIajFzVlp5SmUxRkptWkNiQUt5c1hJNFF6NnpabkFMOVEya200ME85Vjk1VzlqdUNHQ216ajJwYW05QlVQTkV5cmx0YmRJTVBpbWdGcTZwY3NIeDZ2cW1qc3hQR1B0aTFMVDB4SXQwN3ZJUHVDM0NZNk94UDdRZHllWi1Semd4LXNPNTc3bG82UzR4dVh3</guid></item><item><title>人们现在在后院看到“僵尸”松鼠- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQTG1QOExLa1piVEh0c2tZOElsZXJ6cXlmMHR0cmU2c3h1UGdrSklkTXNCRVBtcmNobEtxaTNsaWlHTzJiQ19oTEdsYk9Fc3RiR3QzWWN1YTRGWDljS1Q2a2Q0WlM4OE0yelFsbUFhWW1HaUFpeWhhMzUtVnJZbEZCd1h6Q3c2NW1ZcERYd0N6QW5sQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;As if &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/colorado-residents-are-spotting-weird-looking-rabbits-with-black-horns-and-mouth-tentacles-2000641896"&gt;black-horned rabbits&lt;/a&gt; weren’t strange enough, people are now spotting zombie-like squirrels covered in odd, sometimes bleeding sores in their backyards and parks. These sickly squirrels aren’t zombies, however, but victims of a real viral disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residents in both &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/what-is-squirrelpox-and-should-canadians-be-concerned/"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/05/15/homestead/squirrel-pox-maine-joam40zk0w/"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; have recently reported sightings of the zombie squirrels, dating back to at least 2023. These animals are likely carrying a germ known as the squirrel fibroma virus (SFV). Though the condition is scary-looking, squirrels usually recover from the infection, and it poses no threat to humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV was first &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13037878/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s and is a poxvirus, meaning it’s related to the virus that causes smallpox in humans. That said, it’s a part of a genus, leporipoxvirus, whose only &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/leporipoxvirus#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that%20leporipoxviruses%20are%20zoonotic%2C%20but%20myxoma%20virus%20exhibits%20tropism%20for%20tumor%20cells%20from%20outside%20the%20rabbit%20species."&gt;known natural hosts&lt;/a&gt; are squirrels and rabbits. The infection causes benign tumors, or fibromas, to form across the squirrel’s skin, particularly on its head or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

It predominantly affects gray squirrels, though it can infect &lt;a href="https://ilacadofsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/108-07MS991Final.pdf"&gt;other species&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV can be a dangerous disease for squirrels. The tumors can potentially metastasize to the animal’s internal organs or become so large and numerous on the skin that they cause secondary infections or even hamper the animal’s vision and ability to eat. But according to the &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/squirrel-pox"&gt;Michigan Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, the infection typically doesn’t cause any obvious signs of illness outside of the skin fibromas. And in areas where it is common, like Michigan, the virus hasn’t had any effect on the overall squirrel population. In &lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas"&gt;most cases&lt;/a&gt;, the fibromas regress over time, and the animal recovers completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a hunter with a hankering for squirrel meat, you can also rest easy. Even SFV-infected squirrels are apparently safe for consumption, according to the Michigan DNR. Still, the average person shouldn’t try to touch or handle infected squirrels, or really any wildlife for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On a little side note, SFV is sometimes called the squirrel pox virus. But this is also the nickname for a different pox virus (the &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/sciuripoxvirus"&gt;squirrelpox virus&lt;/a&gt;) that predominantly affects squirrels in the UK. Adding to the confusion, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23307385/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5621524/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; potential squirrel pox viruses in countries like Canada and Germany. All of which is to say: It feels like there should be a cleaner labeling system for these squirrel-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, 37% of Americans say they can tell how their day will go within the first 10 minutes of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else we uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;1 in 3 Americans have morning thrown off by change in routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take much to throw off a morning.

Here’s what people said were the biggest morning disruptors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day? Because routines provide structure, predictability and control, all of which help you mentally and physically prepare for the day ahead. When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day?

When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So What Happens When You Wake Up on the Wrong Side of the Bed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer? A bad day. Half of Americans say they can tell how their entire day will go based on how they feel right after waking up. Younger generations are especially attuned to this connection, with 67% of Gen Z and 58% of millennials linking a rough morning to a rough day ahead. The takeaway? How you start your day matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Generational perception of how mornings affect days. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people don’t just feel the impact of a bad morning, they recognize it. In fact, over 60% said they could likely trace a rough day back to how it started. When you know, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentages of respondents that can identify a bad day was caused by a bad morning. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why does a bad morning lead to a bad day? One possible explanation is that the first hour of your day shapes your mindset, stress levels, and energy. Thus, when you wake up feeling tired, rushed, or out of sync, it can trigger a cascade of negative emotions and decision fatigue that together make it harder to stay focused, patient, or productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can You Turn a Rough Morning Around?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the morning goes sideways, most people have a go-to fix. For some, it’s a solid breakfast. For others, it’s as simple as stepping outside for fresh air or sipping more water alongside that first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the data, these are the top things people do to turn a rough morning around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Eating breakfast early in the day (49%)&lt;br&gt;• Getting fresh air (46%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking as much water as coffee or tea (42%)&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/meditation-cushions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stretching;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stretching&lt;/a&gt; (35%)&lt;br&gt;• Taking a lukewarm or cool shower (27%)&lt;br&gt;• Exercising before going to work (24%)&lt;br&gt;• Spending less than 10 minutes scrolling on a phone (21%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Top seven things to do in the morning to boost your day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of gender, the top three ways to improve a morning were the same:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Eating an early breakfast&lt;br&gt;2. Getting fresh air&lt;br&gt;3. Drinking just as much water as coffee or tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simple habits stood out across the board as the most effective ways to reset and reclaim the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Responses to question - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it's helpful to know how to bounce back from a rough start, the best mornings are the ones that don’t need fixing. That’s where routine comes in. On average, it takes about 25 minutes to feel fully awake. Millennials take the longest, with a 29-minute gap between waking up and feeling awake, while the Silent Generation needs only 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Time spent waking up in minutes, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s no surprise, then, that most people build a morning routine that lasts around 30 minutes — just enough time to fully wake up and move through the habits that help them feel ready for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our findings, these are the most common ways people start their mornings on the right foot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Brushing their teeth (65%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking water (60%)&lt;br&gt;• Making fresh coffee and tea (51%)&lt;br&gt;• Clearing their eyes (48%)&lt;br&gt;• Scrolling through missed notifications (40%)&lt;br&gt;• Stretching (38%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graph showing tasks that comprise a typical morning routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;But What If a Great Morning Starts the Night Before?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people focus on what happens after the alarm goes off, the truth is, better mornings often begin long before that. In fact, most (68%) agree that a good night of sleep is the real secret to a good day — and the data backs it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Cycle showing the relationship between a good night of sleep and having a good day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sleep well, wake well, live better. It’s a cycle worth getting right. Most adults (75%) believe their day would be better if they got the perfect amount of sleep. This is especially true for Gen Zers, with 80% of respondents born between the years 1997 and 2012 believing that getting the perfect amount of sleep leads to a better day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentage of people who believe their day would be better with better sleep, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all know what the perfect night of sleep feels like, but how many of us are actually getting it? When we asked people to compare how much sleep they typically get versus how much they wish they got, the gap was impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority report sleeping between four and six hours a night, even though 80% say their ideal would be seven to nine hours. And while 72% believe hitting that sweet spot would make their day better, only 47% are actually doing it. The struggle for better sleep? Very real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Opinions on getting the perfect amount of sleep. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to Give Yourself the Best Chance at Rest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the path to better mornings starts the night before, the path to better sleep starts before your head hits the pillow. Many people rely on small, familiar habits to help them &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/healthy-bedtime-routine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wind down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wind down&lt;/a&gt; — watching TV, reading, pouring a glass of water, or &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/bed-pro-step-step-guide-150005165.html" data-ylk="slk:putting fresh bedding on the bed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;putting fresh bedding on the bed&lt;/a&gt;. These routines create a sense of calm and consistency, helping &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/your-circadian-rhythm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signal to the body;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;signal to the body&lt;/a&gt; that it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Activities that people say will help them get the right amount of sleep. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Takeaway? Better Days Begin With Better Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first few minutes after waking up to the small habits we rely on before bed, one theme is clear: how we structure our routines matters. A consistent morning sets the tone for the day, but real energy, focus, and resilience start the night before — with enough rest, the right habits, and a space (&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/adult/mattresses" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mattress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mattress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/np/adult-bedding" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bedding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bedding&lt;/a&gt; included) that supports deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because when you sleep better, you live better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR: Quick Answers to Your Morning Routine Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to feel fully awake in the morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On average, it takes about 25 minutes to fully wake up in the morning (though it varies slightly by generation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should a morning routine be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A morning routine should be about 30 minutes long. That’s the average across all age groups and matches the time most people need to fully wake up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to improve a bad morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eating breakfast early, getting fresh air, and drinking water are the top three things people do to improve a bad morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a bad morning really ruin your day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. 49% of people say their morning plays a major role in how the rest of the day goes, and 37% can tell within 10 minutes how their day will unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does better sleep lead to a better day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely. 70% of people believe that a good night of sleep improves their day, and 68% of people believe a good day improves their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What helps people fall asleep and stay asleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top bedtime habits for better sleep include watching TV, reading, drinking a glass of water, using fresh sheets, and limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/healthy-morning-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://naturepedic.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Naturepedic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturepedic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:07:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BMW81OFliQjM3UW5ZRFJIY0psRTVPQnRtbnpXU01QbTlfVWNfMDNPQ1l4ZHJmZDZUWkM0M2lNaTZoOTdEMHhWSlhsZ2tES01ORzBpVEdEdkRpcmFHZllPQmZ5eWNsb3g4N1E</guid></item><item><title>“我的癌症症状被误认为是更年期的迹象–现在我无法行走” -《独立报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

However, she was told the back pain was due to gardening,&lt;/a&gt; despite having only done 20 minutes of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, her symptoms worsened and she stopped eating properly, lost weight, and developed a temperature, later losing all sensation in her legs and as well as bladder and bowel function. After being taken to the hospital and admitted for two weeks, she was given the devastating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;news that she had stage four non-Hodgkin lymphoma in her kidneys, and a tumour wrapped around her spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one round of radiotherapy and further chemotherapy, she is now in remission. However, she has been left unable to walk and is now a full-time wheelchair user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “life-changing” impacts of the cancer have meant she has to reduce her working hours to four a week, while her husband has given up work to be a full-time carer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-right"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dZfcjv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14146"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey told the Spinal Injuries Association she felt her symptoms were “dismissed” by her GP and continued to be dismissed until she was admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “I’d gone from somebody who was quite active before. I’d do a lot of hiking across the moors, I used to go cold water swimming all year round. One of the last things I did before I got ill was an abseil off a 120-foot viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing at this time of life. I’ve not yet been able to get back to driving or anything like that. I’m completely reliant on my husband; it’s messed up my social life, just going out to meet friends or going swimming or popping into town to look around the shops. Emotionally, it’s just completely messed me up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey said she wanted to spread awareness of her situation and help others who might be experiencing similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 PzkRY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14147"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said, “I had no idea that hot flushes would lead to all this. The symptoms you’ve got aren’t always menopause symptoms, and we need to be more mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just get annoyed that it was attributed to menopause and doing gardening when it needed looking into a bit more. I didn’t know anything about &lt;a href="/topic/spinal-cord-injury"&gt;spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt; and when my toes started going tingly, it didn’t occur to me that that’s what it was.

Dharshana Sridhar, campaigns manager at Spinal Injuries Association, said, “Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that women’s health symptoms should never be dismissed or explained away without proper investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too often, women with spinal cord injuries face delays in diagnosis and unnecessary barriers to equitable care, leaving them to cope with life-changing consequences that could have been prevented. Across the board, women’s concerns are frequently overlooked and when disability or other intersecting factors are involved, the barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment become even greater. Through our women’s health campaign, we’re calling for better awareness, earlier diagnosis, and accessible healthcare for every woman, no matter her disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ</guid></item><item><title>阿勒格尼县确认今年首例西尼罗河病毒人类病例- WTAE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNNF84TDBhc3IyeS1WNHlFbjVIakJrOW9DX0dBU3k5SC04ajdudWI3MWs2VTJiQ2ppU1IzbGkwTlZvV0JKMDBwc0djWjJCdlBwUnlEN3lBdzRRZnliM0NEend0VzVrVDhxS2RpVWtFUDZRa0N0NngzOWRwOGNQQWNaa2RtU29FV2pEeHloLWh4cFJOWFYyUXhpS2RibGhmc3lEQXpxcG9faEpHU3RYRXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

You will also see a reduction in belly fat as the fat in your liver begins to decrease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went on to explain that eliminating sugar can restore a healthier gut microbiome—the trillions of microorganisms that live in the digestive tract and play a key role in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lastly, if you have acne or red spots, your skin should improve and look clearer,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advice echoes recent research. A 2019 study of more than 8,000 students in China found that high-sugar soft drinks 'significantly' increased the risk of acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has linked excess sugar to liver fat accumulation and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A leading doctor has revealed cutting out sugar for just two weeks can improve your facial skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians have long highlighted how cutting out sugar—which can trigger drug-like cravings—can boost health, fitness and even performance at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samantha Coogan, a lecturer at the University of Nevada, has previously described the effects of quitting the sweet stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches and bowel changes may last for days or even weeks, but once the body adjusts, she said people often see sharper brain function, fewer sick days and more energy for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Coogan, hair, skin and nails also improve, sleep becomes more restful and weight loss is 'inevitable' when high-calorie snacks are eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting sugar further reduces the risk of serious diseases, with excess intake widely linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sugar is an addictive substance for some people, so it really is necessary to approach it in a similar manner to drug or alcohol detoxification,' she wrote in a recent article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the type most people overconsume are so-called 'free sugars,' found in sweets, chocolate, fizzy drinks and many processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some naturally occurring sugars also count as 'free sugars' like those in honey, syrups, nectars, unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b46d3920-7c20-11f0-a507-fd22384e2bb3" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15010145/Harvard-doctor-reveals-happens-FACE-you-cut-sugar-just-two-weeks.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;How much of 'free sugars' should you consume each day? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says anyone aged 11 or older shouldn't consume more than 30g of added sugar a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they warn children and infants should have less. They recommend the following limits per day: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt; Children aged seven to 10 should have no more than 24g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Children aged four to six should have no more than 19g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children aged two to three should have no more than 14g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Children aged one should have no more than 10g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;While there is no guideline limit for babies under the age of one, sugars shouldn't be added to foods or drinks given to babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, sugar that occurs naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables is not counted as 'free sugar,' according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To cut down, the health service recommends simple swaps such as replacing fizzy drinks or sugary squash with water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also warns that even unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies contain high levels of sugar, advising people to limit intake to no more than 150ml a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who take sugar in hot drinks like tea or coffee, the NHS suggests gradually reducing the amount or switching to a sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advice comes amid a sharp rise in type 2 diabetes cases in the UK, a condition that places immense pressure on the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, government figures estimated that 3.6 million people in England are now living with type 2 diabetes, based on an analysis of diagnosed and undiagnosed cases in each local authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Helen Kirrane, head of policy and campaigns at the charity Diabetes UK, previously said: 'Without the right treatment, it can lead to dangerously high blood sugar levels and this can cause life-altering diabetes-related complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;A disease that turns rabbits into zombie-looking creatures is trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horned, demon-looking rabbits were reported hopping around Fort Collins, Colorado, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rabbits-with-horns-virus-colorado-tentacles-papillomavirus-98b1ad95ba3a0f308bf884d79d1eea7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press (AP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. There have even been claims of the grotesque animals in Washington, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/unusual-zombie-rabbits-spotted-washington-state/BR3GF7UTNFC3ZIZ6GBVHCRE65Q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;KIRO 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus causes ‘zombie’ rabbit disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Chase Gunnell, Communications Manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told &lt;em&gt;MyNorthwest &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus (CRPV) is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Shope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt; papilloma virus (SPV), also known as cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), has been present in the U.S. for around a century and is not new in Washington,” Gunnell wrote in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunnell noted that while people have posted about the rabbits on social media in Washington — WDFW, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;wildlife biologists, and veterinarians have not received any recent reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“We cannot provide confirmation of a wildlife disease based on photos from social media alone,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRPV gives rabbits rough, red lesions around the ears, eyelids, neck, and shoulder, according to the book “Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents,” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cottontail-rabbit-papillomavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths don’t harm the rabbits unless they interfere with eating, Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told &lt;em&gt;The AP&lt;/em&gt;. Once the animals’ immune system fights off the virus, the growths subside.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;h3&gt;‘Zombie’ rabbit disease cannot spread to other species&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for pets catching CRPV, Van Hoose said the virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit, but not to other species. Although the disease helped scientists research the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;human papillomavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who play certain wind instruments, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8628"&gt;&lt;span&gt;like the didgeridoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, may find it easier to breathe while sleeping, according to emerging research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new randomized controlled trial suggests that blowing through a conch shell is another option for keeping our airways clear when we sleep, reducing the risk of a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affecting close to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(19)30198-5/abstract"&gt;a billion adults&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in some form, OSA is characterized by significant pauses in breathing while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among 30 participants with moderate OSA, roughly half the group were tasked with a traditional Indian exercise known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankha"&gt;shankh&lt;/a&gt;, which involves using a conch-shell as a trumpet. Meanwhile, the other half practiced deep, slow breathing through the nose and out a relaxed mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-5-minute-breathing-technique-is-a-powerful-tool-to-reduce-anxiety"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Simple, 5-Minute Breathing Technique Is a Powerful Tool to Reduce Anxiety&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, researchers found that participants in the conch-blowing group slept better and woke up the next day feeling substantially more rested than the deep breathing group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The standard treatment for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which keeps the patient's airway open by blowing air through a facemask throughout the night," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pulmonologist Krishna K. Sharma from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regular breathing exercises like conch blowing could be a useful alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants in the randomized controlled trial practiced their conch blowing with a traditional shankh for fifteen minutes, five days a week. B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;efore the trial, each participant was given a formal lesson on the yogic practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Sharma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six months, the group that practiced the conch exercises reported feeling 34 percent less sleepy during the daytime than the deep breathing group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep monitors also revealed that the conch blowing group had up to five fewer apneas a night. What's mo&lt;span&gt;re, they had significantly higher blood oxygen levels while sleeping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trial is small and not blinded, admits Sharma, but the results are clinically meaningful. He and his colleagues are now planning a larger trial at several hospitals to validate their findings in a more diverse cohort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We're particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA," he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00258-2025"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study showed that “using effective disinfectants on high-touch surfaces can reduce infection risk by over 97%,” Reynolds said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if you do pick up germs, your immune system may be able to fight them off before you get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Regular exercise, good sleep, nutritious food [and] stress management” are key for maintaining a healthy immune system, Doron explained. “People with compromised immune systems, from disease or medications, are [also] at higher risk of becoming sick after being exposed to pathogens.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to avoid getting sick? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I’m in a hotel lobby, I might touch a lot of surfaces … [like] the credit card machine and elevator buttons, but I’m very careful not to touch my face without washing my hands,” Doron said. “So I consider my risk to be very low.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tetro recommended bringing a bottle of hand sanitizer with you everywhere. Make sure it contains 62-70% of ethanol, and use enough for your hands to feel wet for about 20 seconds as you’re rubbing it in, he advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washing your hands with soap and water is also effective, as long as you’re doing it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="properly" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f35e4e4b0df16e32c40bb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;properly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

This makes gait retraining a very promising and effective option for early stage knee osteoarthritis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in the study were aged 18 or over.

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could this be an effective alternative to medication?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/small-change-to-how-you-walk-may-help-relieve-osteoarthritis-pain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB0SXlwZHFJLTV2WTVxWTVLdHp1UFNjSXdZTl9jaGNYRHhzSEZzQTJTLWhZZ2VKVzg5dWdCS1M4UkNXSU00SmNnTlBCN0JhV1RZYm9hR3FrOWpsdURVU1JKMkFhaGRIM1F6OHdwTzRB</guid></item><item><title>具有这种身体特征的男性更有可能患上癌症，专家警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading doctor has warned that 'man boobs' can be a sign of potentially deadly testicular &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a3682a90-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer or liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gynecomastia—when boys or men develop big breasts—can also cause sore or swollen nipples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-a36ae9b0-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says it is 'common' and does not always need treatment, sometimes it can be caused by underlying health issues which need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include kidney disease, thyroid problems or cirrhosis—permanent scarring of the liver often due to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent video posted on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a36ce580-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; which has amassed more than 228,000 views, Dr Surak Kukadia, an NHS GP known as Dr Sooj shared other potential sinister causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The little-known symptom, he said: 'Is such an important sign to be aware of because it could be a sign for so many different things, including things like liver disease, testicular cancer and even breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And yes, men can get breast cancer. It is so important you are aware of that because if you notice any kinds of lumps or bumps in your breasts, it's so important to get checked out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'When you go and see your clinician, we can take a history, we can examine you, and we can even do some investigations like blood tests and hormone profiles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting the video, he received lots of comments from social media users, who shared their personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS GP warned it can be an important sign of several potentially life-threatening illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One user wrote: 'I was diagnosed in 2022 and had an orchiectomy to remove the cancerous testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, we were too late, and it had spread into my lymph nodes and caused me to undergo a Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Please, please check yourself lads.

Many men forget to do the simple weekly checks to check for any lumps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a concerning rise in cancers among young people which has left many experts baffled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men, it is usually treatable with a high survival rate, killing 65 men in the UK each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of men diagnosed with penile cancer early, more than 90 per cent go on to survive at least five years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the outlook for men with the most advanced cancer where it has spread to other parts of the body is bleak, so it is important to catch it early.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other signs of testicular cancer include a lump or swelling, an enlarged testicle, ache or pain in the testicle or the scrotum feeling heavy, firm or hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, breast cancer kills 85 men each year in the UK, with the vast majority of cases occurring in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms in men can include a lump or swelling in the chest or armpit, nipple discharge ,which may have blood in it, sores or ulcers on the chest and a change in the shape or look of the nipple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there has been a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/information-and-support/statistics/"&gt;sharp rise&lt;/a&gt; in liver disease related deaths, with it estimated to kill more than 11,000 Britons each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it was once largely thought to be an illness that affected the elderly and heavy drinkers, it is now rising rapidly among younger adults, with cases in children doubling over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates the condition now affects one in five people in the UK, worryingly with 80 per cent thought to remain undiagnosed because it often has no obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But signs of liver disease include fatigue, feeling weak all the time, loss of appetite, subsequent weight loss, loss of sex drive, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice—yellow skin and whites of the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:14:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R</guid></item><item><title>从Ozempic嫉妒到幽灵般的朋友： GLP-1如何重塑关系-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE15YWZfMjNXSmRQcktNM3pyaDlONHBPVGQ0WUFwMjdFT3huRFBPWWVIUWVNNjczcmFTMHlhc1pwcS1HaFU4d3dDeGVmbjI1Z1lxVWNwM0NMRm81alRvcDM4eGJMSUEzVlZFYTFfaVRIV1Y5VDhIal9TOTV2TzY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

In a Boston suburb, a wife who is struggling to lose weight for lack of a GLP-1 prescription finds herself being happy for — but also sort of resenting — her husband, who’s dropping pounds easily on a weight-loss drug. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I get up early to exercise while he’s in bed or watching the news,” she said. “It gets frustrating. I’m cutting my portions in half, and he wants to go out for ice cream.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, Amanda Torrey, 48, a nanny and a &lt;a href="https://theamandabookverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://theamandabookverse.com/"&gt;romance writer &lt;/a&gt;from Blackstone, is fighting an inner battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’d like to lose 25 to 50 pounds, but instead has been gaining weight. Recently, she saw one of her many friends who is taking a GLP-1. The friend was 100 pounds thinner than she’d been, and looked “adorable,” Torrey said. “And she was feeling great.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Torrey couldn’t get the transformation out of her mind. “Maybe I should just do it,” she told her partner. He’d like to lose weight, too, but they reminded each other about the side effects and how they don’t want to start a drug they’d be on for life, or put themselves at the “whim” of an insurance company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So that was that. Or was it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Everyone else looks so good,” she said wistfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

I have told my husband that it’s time for her to move out, but he doesn’t agree. So now I am stuck taking care of her and her dog, especially now that she has a full-time job. I need help encouraging my daughter to move along with her own life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzpi000r3b7919dx6b6t@published"&gt;Congratulations on being in remission! I would like to suggest that you don’t need help with your daughter—you need help with your husband! I’m sure your husband is a lovely man, but you would have solved this problem already if he hadn’t objected. So the key to your sanity will be getting on the same page &lt;em&gt;as partners&lt;/em&gt; regarding what you want your home life to be like. After that, you can make a plan to confront your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzrg000s3b79mks119i6@published"&gt;When you told your husband that your daughter needed to move out, what reason did he give for disagreeing with you? Maybe he thinks her presence is somehow good for your health or well-being. He might be under the impression that she provides a kind of companionship you benefit from. Or, perhaps his reasons have more to do with him; being the only caretaker in a home can be a lot of pressure and feel a bit lonely. He may feel relieved knowing that your daughter is there to share the burden, and thus be reticent to give that up. Whatever the case is, he needs to articulate why he wants your daughter to stay. And if she does stick around, he should be the one to either whip her behaviors into shape or make up for her oversights.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vztd000t3b79cq2an2rd@published"&gt;A serious illness is a surefire way to put one’s life into perspective—for both the patient and their partner. It causes some folks to draw their loved ones closer, while others yell, “YOLO” and book a Tanzania safari. Still others work to cultivate a peaceful and tranquil home. There is no wrong response. But in this case, as with most relationship discord, communication is key. You and your husband might not be able to reach a full consensus just yet, but I bet you can get there after a few thoughtful, vulnerable conversations. At the very least, I hope he agrees that dirty dishes and laundry are not a gift you should be forced to “receive” at this stage in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:45:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOajc2S1R0cnRjVl9GU0hfTGNnMkVMQ3dha1VOanJzQjU5NldpVFlxdF9OS0FLd2s4a0ZFWWRYNEtfNEhab2tKcXdTUnNXTm0zRFZPRGw2bURUbTFnWjg1eFFjYjY2UC1TeDRZR0ppUWlmZEJnb2c0cHpIYjVBNzhEWDFFZVdiQ3gxd3F3ZHdhYnVJQlhnQTFma3hjZVFydEJXeG5FcTg4Z2hlLU0</guid></item><item><title>LASIK的替代方案-无需激光- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBqUWlqUmhaVVdXaktJS2xNOVRwdXRmUnZPUkluX2FpZFBzVl9TTE12bzRiUThCejFjTFdKcGM1a0tUbEpJSlVvdG5SeUhJbDlyS3kxS2Q4V3pHOGRSVXM5WElWVkZ2TVRjZFBqeVVmMmxuVDVzRjBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have altered vision, ranging from blurriness to blindness. But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK—a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The procedure can result in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative side effects&lt;/a&gt;, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, presented his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (&lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/events/fall.html" target="_blank"&gt;ACS Fall 2025&lt;/a&gt;) held Aug. 17–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue—it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electric+potential/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electric potential&lt;/a&gt; to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;contact lenses&lt;/a&gt;" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens—about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea—a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, these are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://splashblocker.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largely used in healthcare settings &lt;/a&gt;to protect nurses and doctors from patients' flushed pathogens, says Paddy. There are also air &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;sprays &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; have been demonstrated to be effective in sanitising the air and surfaces&lt;/a&gt; in bathrooms, therefore helping to counteract the dissemination of pathogens via toilet "sneezes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another option is to just flush and then leave the stall immediately. "I usually do the flush and run," says Gerba. He also recommends waiting 10 minutes before going into a public toilet after somebody else, though that might be tricky to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;If you bring your phone to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then there are mobile phones. It's not recommended to use your phone while in the toilet stall, says Roberts – your phone is already exceptionally dirty, as you take it with you everywhere, rest it on every ledge, and touch it all the time. If you bring it to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall, and then you'll carry them around with you even after washing your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The simplest thing you can do is to always wash your hands immediately after you go to the bathroom, says Gerba, who notes that the average person in Tucson, Arizona, only spends 11 seconds washing their hands, while the Centers for Disease Control in the United States &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests handwashing for 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. "Only about one in five actually wash their hands adequately," says Gerba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, to prevent catching a disease in the public restroom, wash your hands. Better still, add an extra step of applying hand sanitiser too, as the combination is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/hand-sanitizer-facts.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;significantly more protective than handwashing alone&lt;/a&gt;. And try not to let the fear of pathogens lurking in toilets keep you up at night – your risk is (probably) lower than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-disclaimer.-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only,-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* Disclaimer.

&lt;p&gt;But we all have dreams for that future, and so we went into public health knowing it was not a great approach to riches, and we also knew it was not likely we would ever be thanked. People don’t thank us for something they did not know they were destined to encounter. So we must be secure in the knowledge that what we are doing has a beneficial impact. It became clear when smallpox disappeared with the strategic use of vaccine. It became clear that measles transmission was stopped in this country because of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/"&gt;deliberate strategy using vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, plus surveillance and all of the tools of public health. The majority of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-12-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increase in longevity&lt;/a&gt; in this country through the 20th century was due to public health, the stealth ingredient of health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But our view of the future did not include a vision that people would hunt us down with some of the most powerful guns developed for use in war. And we ask, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the Covid-19 crisis, public health practices were overturned. The usual approach was for a federal recommendation to states, counties, cities, and tribes that could be modified to fit local situations. The federal plans typically included getting vaccines and expertise to the field as needed. At the request of states, federal employees would be assigned to the states with supervision coming from the state. Public health people did not worry about the lack of federal authority to enter the state to help. These were people of quality, serving the public good and they could be trusted. The relationship between CDC and the states was so close that a phone call would usually lead to an invitation from the state. I worked on both sides of that agreement, in the state of Colorado and at CDC. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Covid, the Trump White House gave a different message. The president told the states to develop their own plans and compete for resources. Chaos was the result.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, when we thought the public health damage had reached its limits, the president withdrew from the World Health Organization, a decision so thoughtless that no one had a ready response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Academy of Medicine developed a plan for vaccine distribution when supplies were limited. I was in my 80s but could isolate at home, so a healthy 30-year-old who was required to interface with the public could have been higher on the priority list under the NAM framework. That would have been the right move. Instead, the White House decided everyone 65 and over was a priority, making logical distribution more difficult. Their idea of sound practice was to hire a Stanford professor with no public health experience, Scott Atlas, who promoted the idea of letting low risk individuals get Covid to provide herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We thought public health was on a path toward healing when suddenly, in his second term, President Trump acquired the peculiar expertise of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He promotes raw milk, which can transmit pathogens; promotes the rotting of children’s teeth; and despite exhaustive testing that has shown &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, clings to that belief for reasons that defy understanding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One would think Kennedy’s track record of nonsense would win no followers, yet there are people willing to accept drivel from those in positions of authority. Kennedy would be less hazardous if he decided to do cardiac surgery. Then he would kill people only one at a time rather than his current ability to kill by the thousands. Why is it that killing a single person is seen as murder but killing masses is excused if you are a politician?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this environment, those working in public health must continue to keep the objectives of their profession in mind: prevent premature death, reduce unnecessary suffering, and improve the quality of life for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to define the challenges faced. We have always been challenged by nature with organisms, droughts, malnutrition, and climate change. We have also been challenged by human foibles with addictions to alcohol, tobacco, violence, and power discrepancies. Now we have special challenges because of those who hold power but have no concept of public health responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we can face these new challenges with our traditional threefold approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, try to get the science right. Thomas Henry Huxley, the famous 19th century biologist, described science as “common sense at its best.” Science is not the same as truth, but it is our best avenue to seek the truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, add art to create “creative common sense at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And third, add the &lt;a href="https://iep.utm.edu/roger-bacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moral compass that Roger Bacon called for&lt;/a&gt; 800 years ago. The pope asked for a summary of science, and Bacon warned him that science has no inherent moral compass. Therefore, it needs scientists with a moral compass. When that is done, we have the ability to strive for “moral common sense at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will live through this drought of values, principles, and facts and again apply our talents to improving global health and happiness. Do not back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, be clear. Kennedy’s words can be as lethal as the smallpox virus. Americans deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Foege, M.D., served as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, founder of the Task Force for Global Health, and executive director of the Carter Center and was instrumental in the eradication of smallpox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

Eye specialists emphasize that conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even certain cancers can be detected early through a comprehensive eye exam. These changes are usually invisible to the patient but can be identified by trained professionals using advanced imaging tools. Detecting these early signs allows timely intervention, protecting both vision and overall health, and sometimes even saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28369076" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Eye-signs" source="Orion"&gt;Eye signs&lt;/keyword&gt; that unmask systemic diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes offer a unique, non-invasive window into the body’s overall health. A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine highlights that multiple systemic diseases, ranging from diabetes and hypertension to cholesterol disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancers, often manifest subtle signs in the eyes before other symptoms appear. Retinal blood vessels, for instance, can reveal early vascular problems since they are directly observable, unlike most internal blood vessels. Eye care professionals trained to recognize narrowing, deposits, or abnormal pigmentation in the retina are often the first to identify these risks. Regular eye exams therefore provide critical early warning signals that support broader disease prevention and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Basic yoga poses that bring down BP naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes: detected years before other symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is often dubbed the silent disease because it can cause organ and tissue damage long before noticeable symptoms appear. According to the National Eye Institute of the US, diabetic retinopathy is one of the earliest detectable complications. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing swelling, leakage, or abnormal vessel growth. Studies, including a 2025 Medscape review, show these retinal changes can precede classic diabetic symptoms and even blood test diagnosis. Early detection through routine eye screenings is essential, particularly for people with risk factors like obesity or a family history of diabetes. Timely intervention can prevent vision loss and reduce the risk of serious complications associated with prolonged high blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol visible in the eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol often develop silently, causing serious health risks without obvious symptoms. The eyes, however, can reveal early signs before complications arise. Hypertensive retinopathy, caused by prolonged high blood pressure, damages tiny retinal vessels, leading to narrowing, thickening, or bleeding. Similarly, high cholesterol may manifest as yellow deposits on the eyelids (xanthelasma) or cholesterol plaques inside retinal vessels, known as Hollenhorst plaques. The Frontiers in Medicine review and expert insights from clinics like Heart of Texas Eye Care emphasize that detecting these subtle eye changes early can prompt lifestyle or medical interventions that reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and vascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer and neurological diseases can be spotted too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes may also provide early warning signs for certain cancers and neurological disorders. Eye cancers, such as retinoblastoma or ocular melanoma, may first appear as abnormal pigment changes or lesions in the retina. Additionally, systemic cancers sometimes metastasize to the eyes, and subtle retinal pigment abnormalities, such as patterns resembling a bear’s paw, have been linked to colon cancer. Neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and brain tumors, can cause early symptoms like double vision, unequal pupil responses, or sudden reading difficulties. Research shows that visual field testing and detailed eye exams can identify these issues before patients notice significant symptoms, highlighting the critical role of the eye in early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glaucoma and other silent threats detected early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, often called the silent thief of sight, progresses without obvious symptoms until irreversible vision loss occurs. The disease develops when intraocular pressure rises, damaging the optic nerve. A 2019 study noted that systemic factors like age, hypertension, and high cholesterol may increase glaucoma risk. Normotensive glaucoma, where eye pressure remains normal, may result from low blood pressure or conditions like sleep apnea. Early detection through eye exams, including optic nerve evaluation and pressure measurements, allows timely treatment, often preventing permanent vision loss. This reinforces why glaucoma screenings are a key part of routine eye care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why regular eye exams matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine confirms that comprehensive eye exams serve as a frontline tool for detecting hidden health risks. Routine eye care does more than preserve vision; it can uncover early signs of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cancer, and neurological disorders. Eye specialists are often the first to detect subtle changes that other tests might miss.

On August 14, 2025, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), along with a slew of trusted partners, dropped their 2025 guideline for preventing, detecting, evaluating, and managing high blood pressure in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/one-exercise-could-boost-memory-and-reduce-dementia-risk-says-doctor/amp_articleshow/123302302.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-dietitian-recommends-four-foods-to-lower-blood-sugar-to-non-diabetic-level/articleshow/123293218.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Diabetes dietitian recommends four foods to lower blood sugar to non-diabetic level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, nearly half of adults (46.7%) have high blood pressure, and it’s still the single most modifiable risk for death worldwide. This new guideline doesn’t just outline targets, it puts you at the center, blending lifestyle, science, and real-world tools. Whether you’re looking after your own health or supporting a loved one, it's about feeling empowered, not overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Common Blood Pressure Medications Linked to Low Risk of Total Knee Replacement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cloves-10-health-benefits-of-eating-them-daily/amp_etphotostory/123298472.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Cloves: 10 health benefits of eating them daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention first, but be ready to act fast&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the star of the show: lifestyle. Think heart-healthy diet, less salt, exercise, stress management, you know the drill. But the new guidance encourages early treatment, when needed, to help ward off not just heart attacks and strokes, but also kidney issues, type-2 diabetes, and even memory decline and dementia. Yes, that's right. Your brain, too, is in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important step in managing high blood pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A smarter risk calculator: PREVENT&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet PREVENT, the brand new risk calculator debuting in 2023, now officially part of the guideline lineup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates your 10- and 30-year risk of heart trouble by weighing age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and even zip code, as a nod to social determinants of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharper lab tests&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys and hormones get a closer look: the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test is now routine for all hypertensive patients, not optional anymore. . On top of that, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio test, used to detect a specific hormone-driven type of high blood pressure (primary aldosteronism), now applies to more people, especially if you also have sleep apnea or stage 2 hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain health gets a spotlight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, your blood pressure isn’t just a heart and kidney issue, it’s a brain issue, too. Even slight increases can chip away at memory and cognition. That’s why the guideline now targets a systolic (upper number) goal of under 130 mm Hg, especially to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medication gets personalized&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many adults, especially those juggling type-2 diabetes, obesity, or kidney disease, one pill might not do it. The updates encourage starting with drug classes like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics. If stage 2 hypertension (140/90 mm Hg or up), a combo pill, two drugs in one, is often the way to go. And for some individuals struggling with obesity, adding newer options like GLP-1 medications (yes, the ones often in the headlines) may make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy gets a careful tune-up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension during pregnancy is no joke, with risks like preeclampsia or even preterm delivery. The guideline steps up: recommending low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) for some, tighter blood pressure control during pregnancy (140/90 mm Hg threshold), and continued monitoring postpartum, because high blood pressure can hang around after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The lifestyle hot sheet: Real, doable, effective&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s your personal game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt: Keep it under 2,300 mg/day, ideally closer to 1,500 mg.

However, research shows that drinking beverages hotter than 65°C (149°F) may do more than burn your tongue; it could increase the risk of oesophageal cancer. According to the study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/7185/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and global studies, regularly consuming very hot drinks can damage the oesophageal lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure may cause inflammation and cellular changes that lead to cancer over time. Experts recommend allowing hot beverages to cool before sipping, as this simple habit could significantly reduce the risk of this serious and often overlooked health threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hot drinks may increase the risk of oesophageal cancer: Understanding the connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that hot water or very hot drinks can lead to cancer may sound surprising. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has been studying this link for years. It classified beverages consumed above 65°C (149°F) as "probably carcinogenic to humans." That means there is credible evidence that repeatedly drinking very hot liquids may increase cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed at such high temperatures, hot beverages, including plain hot water, can injure the lining of the oesophagus. Repeated damage can cause inflammation, affect cell structure, and potentially lead to oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a type of throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oesophageal cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oesophageal cancer is a serious condition that affects the muscular tube (oesophagus) connecting the mouth to the stomach. There are two main types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: more common in the upper and middle parts of the oesophagus, and closely linked to &lt;keyword id="28359543" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="hot-beverage-consumption" source="keywords"&gt;hot beverage consumption&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oesophageal adenocarcinoma: typically occurs in the lower part, and is often related to acid reflux or obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squamous cell type is the one most strongly associated with scalding-hot drink intake. Early symptoms can be subtle, such as difficulty swallowing, a persistent sore throat, or unexplained weight loss. Because symptoms often appear late, oesophageal cancer is frequently diagnosed in advanced stages, making it more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not the beverage, it’s the heat: Why beverage temperature matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand: the drink itself is not the issue; it’s the temperature. Whether it's herbal tea, coffee, soup, or plain water, consuming it at scalding temperatures poses the same risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries like Iran, China, and parts of South America, where it's common to consume very hot tea or water, studies have found higher rates of oesophageal cancer. This supports the conclusion that the temperature of the liquid, not its ingredients, is the critical factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expert insight: How hot is too hot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what counts as “too hot”? Research suggests that 65°C (149°F) is the upper limit of safe temperature. However, many people drink freshly poured tea or coffee at temperatures ranging from 70°C to 85°C, which is dangerously high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinks that are too hot to sip comfortably can burn the oesophagus, even if you don’t feel it immediately. This repeated injury to the oesophageal lining may increase the risk of long-term complications, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why temperature awareness is critical for prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oesophageal cancer ranks as the eighth most common cancer globally and has one of the lowest survival rates when detected late.

But the numbers tell a different story. Every year in the United States, more than 375,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and another 106,000 face gynecologic cancers such as ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer. While the majority of these cases are found after menopause, younger women are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that only breast cancer and cervical cancer have routine screening tools. For most other gynecologic cancers, the first clue is a symptom, and those symptoms are often vague, easily mistaken for stress, diet changes, or common conditions. That’s why listening to your body and acting on unusual changes can be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some surprising warning signs that shouldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在大提顿小屋（ Grand Teton lodge ）内发现蝙蝠群后，数百人可能已经暴露于狂犬病中-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5IQ191ajB0RDBJS0l0elpJeHZpaVBYb0hpU21BVjJYbG10UHdSODliV0ZFbEFoUzROZkVBN0VnXzFkM3pLLWpHd1pZa2hMTzBIVGJReGxFUXZ4MjNEcE9GbUlfWjJNMjNJMURaLW5IdEtzTVZSdm9qYXFHZjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hundreds of people may have been exposed to rabies after a suspected bat colony was discovered inside a lodge in Grand Teton National Park in recent months, national park and state health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bat colony was found over the past few months in cabins at the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/jacksonlakelodgeplan.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jackson Lake Lodge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jackson Lake Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, a popular eco-hotel and historic landmark located in Grand Teton National Park, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Park Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;.

Further investigation revealed that the colony was nesting in an attic space above those eight guest rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rooms were closed as a precaution while public health officials investigate and provide recommendations for mitigation, according to the National Park Service. The agency noted that there was no immediate threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Wyoming Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are leading the effort to coordinate with the affected guests' local public health officials, who will conduct rabies risk assessments," the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;State health officials are reaching out to guests for rabies risk assessments and will determine whether they meet the criteria for preventive treatment, the National Park Service said.

Bats help with natural pest control by eating insects — such as mosquitoes — every night, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most common species of bats found in Grand Teton National Park are little brown bats, followed by big brown, silver-haired, hoary, Yuma, long-legged, and long-eared bats, the agency said. Other bats, including California myotis and western small-footed bats, have also been found at the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The National Park Service noted that less than one percent of bats have rabies and has advised park visitors to follow guidelines to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rabid-bats-sparked-public-health-095106987.html" data-ylk="slk:avoid exposure to rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;avoid exposure to rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Observe wildlife from a safe distance.

In Wyoming, the National Park Service said rabies are most commonly found in bats and skunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though rabies is fatal, the CDC says that it is a preventable disease, and has advised people to receive a pre-exposure vaccination for increased protection, vaccinate pets, and immediately seek medical care if exposed. The disease mostly impacts the central nervous system, and causes severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before the onset of symptoms, according to the National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It can take weeks to months for rabies symptoms to appear after the initial exposure, the agency said. The National Park Service added that bats are a "special concern" for rabies exposure due to the small size of their scratches and bites, which may not be noticeable to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Even though rabies in animals is rare, animal exposure, especially involving bats, is treated very seriously due to the fatal outcome if the animal is rabid," according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/17/rabies-bat-colony-grand-teton-lodge-warning/85701872007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bat colony found in Grand Teton lodge, possibly exposing rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bat colony found in Grand Teton lodge, possibly exposing rabies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5IQ191ajB0RDBJS0l0elpJeHZpaVBYb0hpU21BVjJYbG10UHdSODliV0ZFbEFoUzROZkVBN0VnXzFkM3pLLWpHd1pZa2hMTzBIVGJReGxFUXZ4MjNEcE9GbUlfWjJNMjNJMURaLW5IdEtzTVZSdm9qYXFHZjQ</guid></item><item><title>首次同类细胞移植为糖尿病带来更紧密的治愈- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQb04zOFZkNm91OTVWdFpxSUZiSEgtbkY0WDRaSEtGR3BXZ0VIRGVNSFZReFliYmh6dkJiaTYwMmFhM1pKRzJ6VFNEUlp4VnZBQ01pOFJYYjdpUjFsOFF1aFZNVHo1N09ZVjE5V284blA4UTB3eUtzYnZoemlUMnVfZWg4SURLcVU4b0pkWFB6X0l5UnNBZjdNQ09XV0w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A patient with type 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; has begun producing his own insulin after receiving a transplant of pancreatic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in humans, these islet cells have been genetically edited so they wouldn't be rejected by the patient, removing the need for immunosuppressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes usually begins when the immune system mistakenly attacks the islet cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin. The condition is usually managed with a careful diet and regular insulin injections, but an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-grown-functional-insulin-producing-cells-from-stem-cells"&gt;emerging treatment&lt;/a&gt; involves replacing the damaged islet cells with functional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-treatment-may-cure-severe-type-1-diabetes-study-finds"&gt;New Treatment May Cure Severe Type 1 Diabetes, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new proof-of-concept study, a 42-year-old male patient, who had had type 1 diabetes since the age of 5, received a transplant of islet cells from a healthy donor. The cells were delivered through a series of injections into the muscle of his forearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 weeks, the cells successfully produced insulin in response to glucose spikes, such as after meals. But the most important aspect is that the patient didn't require immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the immune system will recognize the transplanted cells as foreign and destroy them, rendering the therapy ineffective. &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/islet-cell-transplants"&gt;To get around that&lt;/a&gt;, patients are given drugs that suppress their immune system. That solution works, but leaves the patients vulnerable to infections and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before the cells were implanted, three genetic edits were made using the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; tool. Two edits reduced the amount of particular antigens that adaptive T cells use to identify foreign objects. The third boosted production of a protein called CD47, which in turn blocks innate immune cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gene edits were successful, but in a way that provided an intriguing control group. Cells with no successful edits were killed off by T cells within a few weeks, while those that knocked out the antigen production were still wiped out by natural killer cells and macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only those with three successful edits survived, and thankfully there were enough of them in the graft to remain functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg" alt="Islet Cells" class="size-medium wp-image-171389" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pancreatic islet cells stained for glucagon  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; (red) and insulin antibody (blue) under the microscope.

Similar studies in humans have shown promise, but always with the help of immunosuppressant drugs, which bring their own complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cells-reverse-type-1-diabetes-in-clinical-trial"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a young woman in China received a transplant of insulin-producing cells grown from her own  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. Within four months, her body was able to produce enough insulin to stay within a safe blood glucose range for over 98 percent of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers on the new study say that their method could not only make for more effective, safer treatments for diabetes, but could be applied to other types of cells, reducing the need for immunosuppressants with other transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A COVID infection, particularly in women, may lead to blood vessels aging around five years, according to research published in the &lt;i&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Blood vessels gradually become stiffer with age, but the new study suggests that COVID could accelerate this process. Researchers say this is important since people with stiffer blood vessels face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Professor Rosa Maria Bruno from Université Paris Cité, France. She said, "Since the pandemic, we have learned that many people who have had COVID are left with symptoms that can last for months or even years. However, we are still learning what's happening in the body to create these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that COVID can directly affect blood vessels. We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular aging, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronological age&lt;/a&gt; and you are more susceptible to heart disease. If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included 2,390 people from 16 different countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Turkey, UK and US) who were recruited between September 2020 to February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were categorized according to whether they had never had COVID, had recent COVID but were not hospitalized, hospitalized for COVID on a general ward or hospitalized for COVID in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed each person's vascular age with a device that measures how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carotid+artery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carotid artery&lt;/a&gt; (in the neck) and femoral arteries (in the legs), a measure called carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). The higher this measurement, the stiffer the blood vessels and the higher the vascular age of a person. Measurements were taken six months after COVID infection and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also recorded demographic information such as patient's sex, age and other factors that can influence cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking these factors into consideration, researchers found that all three groups of patients who had been infected with COVID, including those with mild COVID, had stiffer arteries, compared to those who had not been infected. The effect was greater in women than in men and in people who experienced the persistent symptoms of long COVID, such as shortness of breath and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average increase in PWV in women who had mild COVID was 0.55 meters per second, 0.60 in women hospitalized with COVID, and 1.09 for women treated in intensive care. Researchers say an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is "clinically relevant" and equivalent to aging around five years, with a 3% increased risk of cardiovascular disease in a 60-year-old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who had been vaccinated against COVID generally had arteries that were less stiff than people who were unvaccinated. Over the longer term, the vascular aging associated with COVID infection seemed to stabilize or improve slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno said, "There are several possible explanations for the vascular effects of COVID. The COVID-19 virus acts on specific receptors in the body, called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, that are present on the lining of the blood vessels. The virus uses these receptors to enter and infect cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This may result in vascular dysfunction and accelerated vascular aging. Our body's inflammation and immune responses, which defend against infections, may also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the reasons for the difference between women and men could be differences in the function of the immune system. Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vascular aging is easy to measure and can be addressed with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs. For people with accelerated vascular aging, it is important to do whatever possible to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno and her colleagues will continue to follow the participants over the coming years to establish whether the accelerated vascular aging they have found leads to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial Dr. Behnood Bikdeli from Harvard Medical School, Boston, U.S. and colleagues said, "Although the acute threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, a new challenge emerged in its aftermath: post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Defined by the World Health Organization as symptoms appearing three months post-infection and lasting at least two months, studies suggest that up to 40% of initial COVID-19 survivors develop this syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This large, multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled 2,390 participants from 34 centers to investigate whether arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, persisted in individuals with recent COVID-19 infection. […] sex-stratified analyses revealed striking differences: females across all COVID-19-positive groups had significantly elevated PWV, with the highest increase (+1.09 m/s) observed in those requiring ICU admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The CARTESIAN study makes the case that COVID-19 has aged our arteries, especially for female adults. The question is whether we can find modifiable targets to prevent this in future surges of infection, and mitigate adverse outcomes in those afflicted with COVID-19-induced vascular aging."&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that microglia, immune cells in the brain, mistakenly remove nerve fibers connecting the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb—two regions essential for processing odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immune-driven pruning occurs when hyperactive neurons display altered membranes, marking them as defective even when they are not. By identifying this mechanism, the study highlights a pathway that could allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment before cognitive symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Misfire:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia break down nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; These changes occur before cognitive decline, making smell loss a potential diagnostic tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may allow earlier use of amyloid-beta antibody treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fading sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease even before cognitive impairments manifest. Research by scientists at DZNE and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) sheds new light on this phenomenon, pointing to a significant role for the brain’s immune response, which seems to fatally attack neuronal fibers crucial for the perception of odors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, is based on observations in mice and humans, including analysis of brain tissue and so-called PET scanning. These findings may help to devise ways for early diagnosis and, consequently, early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers come to the conclusion that these olfactory dysfunctions arise because immune cells of the brain called “microglia” remove connections between two brain regions, namely the olfactory bulb and the locus coeruleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb, located in the forebrain, analyzes sensory information from the nose’s scent receptors. The locus coeruleus, a region of the brainstem, influences this processing by means of long nerve fibers originating from neurons in the locus coeruleus and extending all the way to the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The locus coeruleus regulates a variety physiological mechanisms. These include, for example, cerebral blood flow, sleep-wake cycles, and sensory processing. The latter applies, in particular, also to the sense of smell,” says Dr. Lars Paeger, a scientist at DZNE and LMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that in early Alzheimer’s disease, changes occur in the nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus to the olfactory bulb. These alterations signal to the microglia that affected fibers are defective or superfluous. Consequently, the microglia break them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alterations in the membrane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team of Dr. Lars Paeger and Prof. Dr. Jochen Herms, who is a co-author of the current publication, found evidence of changes in the composition of the membranes of the affected nerve fibers: Phosphatidylserine, a fatty acid that usually occurs inside a neuron’s membrane, had been moved to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer site of the cell membrane is known to be an “eat-me” signal for microglia. In the olfactory bulb, this is usually associated with a process called synaptic pruning, which serves to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional neuronal connections”, explains Paeger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our situation, we assume that the shift in membrane composition is triggered by hyperactivity of the affected neurons due to Alzheimer’s disease. That is, these neurons exhibit abnormal firing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wide range of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of Paeger and colleagues are based on a plethora of observations. These include studies on mice with features of Alzheimer’s disease, analysis of brain samples from deceased Alzheimer’s patients, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smell issues in Alzheimer’s disease and damage to the associated nerves have been discussed for some time. However, the causes were unclear until yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, our ﬁndings point to an immunological mechanism as cause for such dysfunctions – and, in particular, that such events already arise in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” says Joachim Herms, a research group leader at DZNE and LMU as well as a member of the Munich-based “SyNergy” Cluster of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for early diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called amyloid-beta antibodies have recently become available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. For this novel therapy to be effective, it needs to be applied at an early stage of the disease, and this is precisely where the current research could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could pave the way for the early identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, enabling them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention with amyloid-beta antibodies, increasing the probability of a positive response,” says Herms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this olfaction and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08d8192839593ce8e8589949a859294a0849a8e85ce8485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marcus Neitzert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzne.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marcus Neitzert – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62500-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Paeger et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE0zeWhrMnF0VEJDX250U09NQWtmOUltMi1PU3lDb3JNaDBobmdzdEVQZnZnWUJwc29HLWk4M0ZjVG9zX1lTYVlCSWxzbU1JdjFIMHY0SExKX0JnVlBiVDdHaE82N0hVc3FJM3lHYjlJbEwxMGp1</guid></item><item><title>专家说，走路更快，活得更久- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOUkZCaENNR1ZDejNCLVk2X1JWMnIxMHVvY0toSXd2SDhYYTZzY2xjZ0RuQ2NDb3RnTXZ2WVVkQlpuMUlHdkktVXdvam14SWNia0hPUld4NVEtdXhRdEpkM2xBZlFocUV1enlKNENIajB1MUdmc21JaGxPSTlINC11Z1NMdlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Too busy to go to the gym? Don't worry — you can stay healthy by incorporating at least 15 minutes of fast walking into your everyday routine, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it's recommended that people commit to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week to see sufficient health benefits, said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study's corresponding author. But if 150 minutes is too difficult to manage, fast walking a minimum of 15 minutes every day can have the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng and a team of researchers recruited mostly low-income and Black study participants from 2002 to 2009, according to the study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The nearly 85,000 participants were given a comprehensive questionnaire about their exercise habits, average time spent working out, walking speed and health. Then the participants completed a questionnaire about 16 years later, and the analysis began in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know "fast &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51188871" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is good compared to slow walking," but there isn't much research on how many minutes you should spend fast walking on average, said Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and the Anne Potter Wilson Professor in Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, study participants who fast walked for at least 15 minutes every day saw a nearly 20% reduction in premature death compared with a 4% reduction among participants who walked slowly for a total of more than three hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. And it certainly makes sense, because you can imagine, somebody who's in really bad shape is probably not going to be able to walk very quickly," said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking can impact your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has health benefits, such as managing weight and sugar intake, reducing the risk of cancer, easing joint pain and boosting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts "know that when people are exercising regularly, blood vessels can relax and dilate a bit better. And then we also know that exercise is quite good for cholesterol, so it seems to lower cholesterol. And then overall, it reduces the risk of cancer and things that would otherwise hurt people," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily can also lower the risk of dementia or cognitive decline in people predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in daily physical activity, such as walking, promotes better sleep and reduces inflammation, which improves brain structure, according to the Piedmont Medical Center in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to emphasize that these exercises, no matter slow or fast, all confirm some benefit," Zheng said. "But what we find is that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day confirms substantiated benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking has been found to have specific benefits, such as decreasing the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(T)he thought is that exercise has a very big effect on blood pressure, as you may know, and blood pressure, it is one of the more exponential risk factors that we have, for roughly every 20 points blood pressure goes above 120 (what is considered normal or healthy), the risk of a cardiac event roughly doubles," Freeman said. "So, it's a super potent and exponential risk factor, and we know that regular exercise lowers that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, you can tell you're fast walking when you're able to talk but not sing, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can increase your walking pace by a couple of steps and track it with a metronome, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/health/walking-cadence-mobility-speed-endurance-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;July study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I usually recommend that they get up before work, and they go for a brisk walk or a bike or a swim, or they do some high-intensity interval training, whatever it is that they're into," Freeman said. People can go to "a rec center, or they walk outside, if it is safe, or whatever it may be, and just weave it into their day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following good &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/perfecting-your-walking-technique#:~:text=Eyes%20up.,reduce%20your%20risk%20of%20injury." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;walking form&lt;/a&gt;, such as standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms, can help prevent backaches, make it easy to breathe and keep you balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking is a full-body movement. It is not just about your lower body. It's not just one step in front of the one foot in front of the other," said Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, in a previous article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your arm swing is a huge part involved in the mechanics of walking. So, you want to have an arm swing that's coordinated with your foot movement, so it's opposing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take it up a notch? When doing any form of exercise, try to practice conscious or nasal breathing, which is when you inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps regulate blood pressure and can prevent hypertension, according to Santas&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
