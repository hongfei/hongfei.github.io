&lt;p&gt;They’re pumping protein — and guzzling sugar bombs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fairlife’s Core Power protein shakes — beloved by fitness fanatics and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/health/drugs-like-ozempic-can-affect-your-fertility-dietitian-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ozempic users&lt;/a&gt; alike — have just been crowned the unhealthiest bottled beverage in America, despite their muscle-boosting reputation, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eatthis.com/unhealthiest-bottled-drinks-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eat This, Not That!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakes like these are a “great way to start the day without having to sit down and have a full breakfast,” gushed Elise Ramer, a 42-year-old PR pro in Florida, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/us-news/ozempic-mounjaro-users-drink-protein-shakes-to-beef-up-muscles/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramer said she puts Core Power in her coffee while taking the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/fda-cracking-down-on-ozempic-copycats-potentially-slimming-options-for-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight-loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; — since users need to focus on their protein intake due to the possible muscle loss side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But nutrition experts are throwing a red flag on the play.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I put these first [as the unhealthiest bottled drink in the U.S.] because they are so highly marketed as a great source of protein and a healthy food when in reality they are a disaster to your metabolic health,” registered dietitian Mary Sabat recently told Eat This, Not That!&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts warn that protein shakes — a hit with many Ozempic users (above) — are hyped as health drinks but are actually a metabolic meltdown in a bottle. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;myskin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Core Power protein shakes may seem like a convenient post-workout drink, but a closer look at the ingredients reveals several health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shakes are made by Fairlife, owned by Coca-Cola, and boast up to 42 grams of protein per bottle — but that muscle comes with a side of controversy. According to Sabat, it’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/12/health/what-ozempic-like-drugs-may-treat-beyond-obesity-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not just about sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They use non-organic, conventional dairy, which often comes from cows fed GMO corn and soy and may contain residues of hormones and antibiotics — unlike grass-fed dairy, which is higher in omega-3s and CLA and free from harmful residues,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The addition of carrageenan, a thickening agent linked to gut inflammation and irritation, further detracts from its health profile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sabat also slammed the inclusion of artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, warning they’ve been “associated with gut microbiome disruption and potential carcinogenic effects in animal studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The shakes, churned out by Coca-Cola-owned Fairlife, pack a whopping 42 grams of protein — but that muscle boost comes with a side of scandal. And it’s not just sugar, warns Sabat. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jammy Jean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Lastly, the label includes ‘natural flavors,’ a term that can encompass up to 100 different undisclosed chemical additives, many of which are far from natural. Together, these ingredients make Core Power far less healthy than its marketing implies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped the protein craze. Thanks to the Ozempic effect, these shakes are flying off shelves faster than a gym bro’s tank top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales of protein and meal-replacement drinks surged 11.1% to a whopping $4.7 billion last year — and it’s the Ozempic army leading the charge, retail tracker SPINS revealed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As The Post previously reported, Rila Global Consulting found 13% of those on GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro had consumed protein shakes in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But some experts warn that overloading on protein — especially the highly processed kind — can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As The Post previously reported, 13% of Ozempic and Mounjaro users have chugged protein shakes in the past two years, according to Rila Global Consulting. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tobias Arhelger – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joseph Antoun, CEO of longevity company L-Nutra, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/health/how-much-protein-you-need-and-what-happens-if-you-eat-too-much/"&gt;previously told The Post&lt;/a&gt; that too much animal protein can raise IGF-1 levels, a hormone linked to accelerated aging, cancer and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal isn’t to just build muscle — it’s to live long enough to use it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, maybe stick to a protein-packed egg — and leave the mystery “natural flavors” to the lab rats.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Health officials in Utah opted not to notify the public about a measles case that entered the state last month, citing low risk and prior vaccination. The case first came into public light Monday afternoon, during a &lt;a href="https://summitcounty.granicus.com/player/clip/923?view_id=1&amp;amp;redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Summit County Board of Health meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the individual had previously been vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others,” DHHS said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 19 – traveler arrives in Utah, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 23 – traveler returns to Salt Lake City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their stay in Idaho, the individual then became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to DHHS. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn’t make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic,” said Derek Moss, Summit County Nursing Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health response &amp;amp; passenger notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed past their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection, and at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers, though health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“State and local health officials are staying in touch with those individuals, and none of them has developed a measles infection. The typical incubation period is 1-3 weeks.” said DHHS in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarifications on public health procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS addressed several points of misinformation Tuesday after information about the case became public during the Summit County Board of Health meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traveler was never placed on a “do not board” list, contrary to some reports, as they were past their infectious period by the time of their flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While one of the vaccines they received is not approved in the U.S., health officials emphasized that any dose of an MMR vaccine significantly decreases the risk of spreading measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t officials issue a public health advisory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about its decision to withhold a public advisory, the DHHS provided the following explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public health officials weigh many factors when we decide whether to notify the public about a situation. In low-risk situations, when we are able to address the issue in a more focused and isolated manner, broad public messaging is not always warranted. Additional information would be released if the situation changes or more data suggests an increased risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles prevention &amp;amp; summer travel advisory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited risk in this incident, measles remains highly contagious. Due to increasing cases across North and South America, health officials urge Utah residents to verify their vaccination status before traveling this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or healthcare provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel,” said DHHS in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine remains one of the most effective measures against measles and is recommended for anyone planning to travel in regions experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Raw cheese is aged. “FDA regulations require raw cheese to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/sampling-protect-food-supply/microbiological-surveillance-sampling-fy14-16-raw-milk-cheese-aged-60-days" target="_blank"&gt;aged at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rao. “During this time, harmful bacteria are often neutralized by natural cultures and lactic acid, making the cheese safer.”&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just romantic old-world tradition; it’s science-backed risk mitigation. So yes, raw Brie de Meaux, aged Roquefort, or Manchego? &lt;i&gt;Bon appétit.&lt;/i&gt; But raw milk straight from the udder? That’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

It suggests a troubling link to sugar specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the study, told the Daily Mail: 'Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere — it was in their liver, lungs, other organs - and they were very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that sugar can cause damaging changes to the gut microbiome, which can lead to mutations in cells that result in tumors forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 63 percent of Americans aged 18 or older report consuming at least one soda a day, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study included 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old, of which 112 had stage four disease and 191 had stages one to three disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each filled in a dietary questionnaire to allow researchers to analyze their consumption and detect any possible links between their diets and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were asked: 'Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 45 percent of stage 4 patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison the share was 29 percent in the group with less advanced cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Consuming high sugar drinks could raise your risk of being diagnosed with advanced colon cancer, a study suggests &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study concludes: 'In a single center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, the biggest gathering of cancer researchers in the world, which is attended by 40,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results have been published &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244792"&gt;as an abstract&lt;/a&gt;, and not yet in a scientific journal where they will be reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that regularly consuming sodas can cause sugar to build-up in the colon when it cannot be fully absorbed, changing the gut microbiome and potentially boosting levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sugar can be used as fuel for tumor cells which may cause the cancer to grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published last year found that diets low in fiber and high in sugar spark the proliferation of a bacteria called Fusobacterium in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes widespread inflammation in the gut, which has been shown to age cells, making them more vulnerable to cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study 51 percent of patients were female. All had no previous cancer diagnosis and were under 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals diagnosed with stage four were younger, at an average age of 41 years, compared to 43 years in the other group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year and 52,900 will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the 1990s early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They see a rich color on the crust and feel reassured by words like wholegrain or freshly baked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/about_us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Young&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Real Bread Campaign&lt;/a&gt; notes that the color alone doesn’t always match what’s actually inside the loaf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers add caramelized ingredients for a darker hue, which can create the appearance of a more wholesome, wheat bread product than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been growing focus on how certain ingredients might affect our health. One example is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, which are additives that change the texture of bread and extend its shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has revealed that these substances can disrupt our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. This concern is one of the reasons people pay extra for options that look better on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The likes of ‘wholegrain’, ‘sourdough’, ‘ancient grains’ and ‘freshly baked’ provide no guarantee of how, where, or when a product was made, or with what,” said Chris Young. Empty claims can appear on “wheat” bread packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wheat-bread-pitfalls"&gt;Wheat bread pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us want a loaf of bread that’s genuinely wholesome, yet it can be tricky to know what’s in that bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some manufacturers add caramelized brown sugar or molasses to enhance the depth of color,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duane-Mellor-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duane Mellor&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer at &lt;a href="https://www.aston.ac.uk/hls/aston-medical-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aston Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step can mislead people, who might mistake color for genuine nutritional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains provide many nutrients, including fiber and vitamins. For a healthier option, a dietitian named &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/sammie-gill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sammie Gill&lt;/a&gt; recommends looking for a loaf with fewer ingredients. That suggestion can help people skip the extras that make bread soft but may not promote wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sourdough-confusions"&gt;Sourdough confusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for tangy, longer-fermented bread is on the rise. True sourdough usually starts with a live bacterial culture and no baker’s yeast, which can slow digestion of carbs and help regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the product is named or marketed using the word sourdough, but the ingredients list reveals the use of baker’s yeast, a chemical raising agent, or any additive, it’s sourfaux,” said Chris Young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeled products do pop up. A quick label check is often enough to tell which one is genuinely fermented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fermentation stage takes longer, so true sourdough can cost more. Some brands cut corners by adding yeast to speed things up and still call it sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-fiber-and-fermentation-matter"&gt;Why fiber and fermentation matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread that’s higher in dietary fiber helps feed the good bacteria in your gut, which in turn can support digestion, immune function, and even mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholemeal and rye &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/freezing-bread-could-make-it-healthier/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; naturally contain more of this fiber compared to white bread, making them more effective at supporting a balanced microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented breads like real sourdough can take that one step further. The long fermentation process produces compounds that promote short-chain fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are strongest when breads are made without additives and use traditional sourdough starters, not shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-healthiest-option"&gt;Choosing the healthiest option&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of bread on the market, from rustic rye to seeded whole wheat bread. Those that contain more authentic whole grains tend to have higher levels of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rye bread is well liked for its dense texture and earthy taste. It can also contain a solid amount of fiber, which can aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts suggest blending your grain choices, since each type provides different nutrients. Some days might call for sourdough, while others might be better suited for a traditional wholemeal loaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-gluten-free-breads"&gt;What about gluten-free breads?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who avoid gluten often reach for gluten-free breads expecting similar benefits to wholegrain loaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of these products are ultra-processed and contain added starches, gums, and stabilizers that don’t offer the same fiber or nutrient profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they’re helpful for those with &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or gluten intolerance, they’re not always healthier by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialty &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-bread-wheat-gave-rise-to-civilization/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; like those made with ancient grains, such as spelt, einkorn, or teff, can offer additional nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These grains often contain more protein and minerals than standard &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/u-s-wheat-market-has-been-remarkably-resilient-amid-climate-change/"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and some people find them easier to digest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, label reading remains important, since not every “ancient grain” loaf is made with a significant amount of the grain it advertises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also matters how many slices you eat. Two slices of wholemeal bread in a day can help meet part of a suggested three daily servings of whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks vary with wholegrain cereals, brown rice, or popcorn, which helps feed different kinds of gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrap-up is that color alone won’t guarantee a loaf’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forests-provide-different-health-benefits-based-on-their-structure/"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. A little time spent scanning labels can reveal whether a brown loaf is plain white bread in disguise or a truly beneficial staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524002028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOOTFXek9PMlRMcVZianJFb3hhN0hhalpKUzAyTlMzTWNhX051dkF3ZHJaelpWZW1sTy1oNmZCbHZZSXdBaVpGb1UyajlTZHJWdURjTVhpdTFKVDhwcUYtNFl4NEFUSXpDRTVBeF9MZHI4Y0g5Nkx2cDQtTHFLcHBSUG15Q1ZmWVRmeDJMbUUzcHRURERSdl9MQlBBZzBPZ2NHUS1lSEgyT0lla015YUtDWlpBZw</guid></item><item><title>的确，减少卡路里摄入量会让你感到沮丧-泰晤士报 | It’s true, cutting calories will make you depressed - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQZ2RjWUJXZ0l0bUNsTVVjal9tNnNZMEQteUdGdlBtQXFUcF82TUd2SS1RcDV1eFhfNlFiaC1fYWxJSWxyRmVHYnRTNk1lMllwZERudjlKaXA2T0pfak04YjNjZmxqYl9WR2VCbkdtOG9PU3E3cU5fVmlPVnJtNHJ3UG9haEVYMXBDWTNtTER5NWd3NEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Anyone who has ever attempted to forgo the biscuit tin in favour of carrot sticks will know that dieting can be a miserable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Now a study has confirmed that cutting calories really is linked to a heightened risk of depression — especially if you are a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers based at the University of Toronto examined data from 28,528 adults in the United States who were followed for a decade. They completed surveys on their typical daily food intake and any diets they were following, as well as clinical assessments of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Participants on low-calorie diets scored more highly for depressive symptoms, including feeling tired, having difficulty concentrating or “little interest or pleasure in doing things”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The authors of the study said this may be&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; because restricting food results in “nutritional deficiencies” in protein and vitamins, which can worsen brain function and result in low mood. “Lack of weight loss or weight cycling while dieting in a real-world setting may lead to worsening depressive symptoms,” they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The impact was greater in men than women, which may be due to their “greater nutritional needs” and the fact men tend to find diets harder than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Writing in the journal in BMJ Nutrition Prevention &amp;amp; Health, the researchers said: “Our study suggests that caloric-restricted diets are the only dietary pattern that is associated with significantly increased depressive symptom scores compared with those not on a diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Brain health depends on getting enough glucose for energy and enough omega-3 fatty acids to help it function. Diets may therefore “worsen brain function”, they said. They noted that “real-life calorie-restricted diets and obesity often result in nutritional deficiencies and induce physiological stress, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Participants completed a standardised clinical depression survey called PHQ-9, which provides a score out of 27. Nearly one in ten were on a calorie-restrictive diet, and on average these people scored 0.29 points higher in their depressive scores than those not on a diet. Men experienced more severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers said: “We hypothesise that, because biological men typically have higher caloric needs, restrictive diets may pose unique challenges that influence mood differently compared with biological women.” They added that “men tend to prefer fatty meals and frequent fast-food restaurants more than women”, meaning that going on a diet is more likely to lead to a depressed mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study was observational and did not examine cause-and-effect. Experts said further trials were needed to assess the link between diets and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Sumantra Ray, of the NNEdPro Global Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health, said: “This study adds to the emerging evidence linking dietary patterns and mental health, raising important questions about whether restrictive diets which are low in nutrients considered beneficial for cognitive health, such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, may precipitate depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She cautioned that the effect sizes were small and “further well-designed studies” were needed to assess the link between diets and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQZ2RjWUJXZ0l0bUNsTVVjal9tNnNZMEQteUdGdlBtQXFUcF82TUd2SS1RcDV1eFhfNlFiaC1fYWxJSWxyRmVHYnRTNk1lMllwZERudjlKaXA2T0pfak04YjNjZmxqYl9WR2VCbkdtOG9PU3E3cU5fVmlPVnJtNHJ3UG9haEVYMXBDWTNtTER5NWd3NEU</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，尽管存在健康风险，但使用大麻的老年人比以往任何时候都多-福克斯新闻 | More seniors are using cannabis than ever before despite health risks, research shows - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;div class="contain" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;   &lt;div class="info" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;p data-v-5f342d4c&gt;Senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses advancements in artificial intelligence aimed at predicting an individual's future risk of breast cancer and the increased health risks from cannabis as users age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;New data has revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; among older adults is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at UC San Diego and NYU discovered that marijuana use by Americans aged 65 and older increased by nearly 46% from 2021 to 2023, according to an NYU press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more states &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;legalize marijuana&lt;/a&gt; for recreational use, as well as for medicinal therapies, accessibility to the drug is more widespread, particularly among aging adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-connected-cannabis-related-hospital-visits-says-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 7% of 15,000 adults in this age range reported using cannabis in the last month, according to 2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This was an increase from 4.8% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While marijuana use surged in both men and women, it was more prevalent among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marijuana use was found to be more prevalent among women in the study.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that increased use was associated with health conditions &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a college or post-grad degree, an annual income of $75,000 or more, married status and residence in a state with legalized medical cannabis were also more likely to partake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adults with the highest incomes initially had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use versus other income levels, but by 2023, they had the highest prevalence, which may indicate better access to medical cannabis given its costs," the researchers noted in the study discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/older-americans-turn-marijuana-better-sleep-pain-relief-heres-what-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLDER AMERICANS TURN TO MARIJUANA FOR BETTER SLEEP AND PAIN RELIEF: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also warned that the use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, could cause complications in chronic disease management &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in older adults.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;New reports continue to find cannabis-related health risks in older users, experts warn.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not look at the frequency of cannabis use, cannabinoid type or recreational versus medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, senior author Joseph Palamar, PhD, associate professor of population health at NYU Langone, noted his concern about cannabis use increasing among older populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/daily-weed-smokers-higher-risk-heart-attack-stroke-american-heart-association-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DAILY MARIJUANA SMOKERS FACE HIGHER RISK OF HEART ATTACK, STROKE, SAYS AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION STUDY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palamar suggested the increased use is likely due to a combination of greater availability, decreased stigma and previous marijuana users aging into the 65+ cohort.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worry is that some of these people may have adverse &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;psychiatric reactions&lt;/a&gt;, especially if they use edibles," he said. "It's very easy to accidentally eat too much, and then there's no turning back once it's already ingested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased use was associated with health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Barbara Krantz, medical director at Caron Treatment Centers in Florida, confirmed that she’s seen a "significant uptick" in cannabis use by individuals over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"It is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I'm very disturbed that the elderly are using it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While polls have shown that most older Americans use cannabis to improve sleep, reduce pain, alleviate mental health issues and to relax, Krantz shared some potential dangers of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, increased hypertension and tachycardia, as well as worsening of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/copd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/a&gt; (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis may also lead to interactions with other medications, which can increase their toxicity or decrease their effectiveness, Krantz cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential risks include balance issues, delayed reaction times, increased confusion or cognitive impairment, and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heightened anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, depression or anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could also be surgery-related risks, including complications due to anesthesia and delays in healing, the expert noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seniors should talk to their healthcare provider and their pharmacist before using any marijuana or cannabis product, because there are very real and specific dangers for older adults when using these substances," Krantz advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers and experts encourage older adults to discuss cannabis use with their doctors.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented on these findings during an appearance on "America’s Newsroom" on Tuesday, noting that regular use of cannabis can be dangerous if not tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might use a gummy to go to bed, and then the next thing, you're using two gummies, or three gummies, and it could increase anxiety, it can increase discombobulation, you're not thinking clearly, ER visits are on the increase," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know about problems with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the lungs&lt;/a&gt;," Siegel added. "It can accelerate dementia and can affect behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor likened the use of marijuana to the effects of smoking cigarettes in terms of damage to the heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One doctor likened the use of marijuana to the effects of smoking cigarettes in terms of damage to the heart and lungs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I'm very disturbed that the elderly are using it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've completely jumped the gun [on legalization] because people are going to the ER with psychosis.

The team found that horizontal basal cells (HBCs), marked by KRT5, actively support new neuron generation alongside globose basal cells (GBCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model helps explain how aging or viral infections like COVID-19 impair smell by disrupting stem cell function. The easy-to-use system is designed to be accessible for labs with limited resources and may pave the way for future human organoids to test therapies for smell loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Helpers:&lt;/strong&gt; HBCs, once thought inactive, are critical to olfactory neuron regeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Older mouse cells showed reduced neuron formation, likely due to GBC decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; The model is low-cost and adaptable for widespread research use in smell disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a newly devised, three-dimensional model to study the regeneration of nerve tissue in the nose, researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) and colleagues have discovered that one type of stem cell thought to be dormant may play a more significant role in preserving the sense of smell than originally believed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike cells in the central nervous system, sensory neurons in the nasal cavity have a remarkable ability to regenerate throughout life despite near constant exposure to the outside environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral infections such as COVID-19, exposure to toxins, or even aging itself can diminish their function or the ability of these cells to replicate, which can lead to a partial or complete loss of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110633"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman smelling a flower." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The ultimate goal is to use this mouse-tissue model of olfactory sensory neurons as a pathway to developing a human organoid that can be used to screen drugs to treat people whose sense of smell is significantly diminished or gone. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team of researchers devised a new, easy-to-create, three-dimensional olfactory tissue mouse model or organoid to help scientists better study how neurons are continually formed in the nose and why this process might decline in disease and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research, published recently in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;, uses this mouse model to show how two types of stem cells in the nose, called horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), communicate and support each other to develop new smell-sensing nerve tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that these two stem cells may be interdependent,” says Brian Lin, senior author on the study and a research assistant professor in the Department of Developmental, Molecular and Chemical Biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One type that we thought was largely dormant— HBCs—may actually play a crucial role in supporting the production of new neurons and the repair of damaged tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this model, the team identified a specific subpopulation of HBCs, marked by their production of the protein KRT5, that actively support the generation of new olfactory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that these particular HBCs play a key role in the formation of the organoids, and they found that when these cells were selectively depleted from the organoid cultures, the generation of new neurons was significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that these stem cells, once thought to be dormant, are essential players in the regenerative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also looked at cells from mice of different ages and grew them in the model,” Lin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a decline in the ability of the older mice cells to generate new neurons. We think this is due to a decrease in the GBC population as we age, but we need to do more work to test this hypothesis and if so, develop ways to rejuvenate them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An Easy-To-Use Model &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author of the study, Juliana Gutschow Gameiro, a former Ph.D. student visiting GSBS, came to Tufts from the State University of Londrina, Parana, in Brazil. Lin says she was dedicated to developing a model that was easy to create in labs with limited funds and equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because loss of smell is associated with COVID-19, as well as with Parkinson’s disease and other conditions, a much larger number of researchers from a variety of different fields have begun researching olfactory epithelial cells in the last few years,” says Lin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to develop an easy-to-use model so that non-stem cell biologists and those working in labs with limited resources could use it to better understand how olfactory neurons regenerate and what happens that causes that process to diminish or fail completely,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Next Step: A Human Organoid &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to use this mouse-tissue model of olfactory sensory neurons as a pathway to developing a human organoid that can be used to screen drugs to treat people whose sense of smell is significantly diminished or gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids make pre-clinical trial research quicker, less expensive, and potentially more effective than using whole animals or existing human cell cultures. Organoids have already been developed for lungs, kidneys, and other organs, but not for human olfactory tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s challenging to get pure olfactory tissue from humans,” Lin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals are anesthetized and a brush similar to a COVID test wand is pushed deep into the nasal cavity. Unlike in their mouse model, human respiratory stem cells and olfactory stem cells collected in this process are difficult to separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s next challenge is to develop a simple, inexpensive technique for separating out the human olfactory stem cells and coaxing them to grow in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Research reported in this article was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R21 DC018681-01 and R01 DC017869-03, the Coordenaҫão de Aperfeiҫoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the Walter Benjamin Program, and by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation.

Yet aging has continued its steady, unyielding course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are taking a bold new direction. Instead of focusing solely on how we live, they’re investigating how we die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re zeroing in on something called “necrosis” – a violent, uncontrolled form of cell death once seen as nothing more than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological wreckage&lt;/a&gt; – and uncovering its surprising potential to reshape how we understand disease, degeneration, and the future of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-life-expectancy-faces-a-triple-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-necrosis-disrupts-healthy-cell-function"&gt;Necrosis disrupts healthy cell function&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells typically renew themselves through controlled processes. This renewal helps replace old cells and keep tissues functional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis occurs when cells die in an abrupt, uncontrolled manner, usually in response to injury, infection, or severe stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike apoptosis, the body’s carefully programmed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;process of cell death&lt;/a&gt;, necrosis unleashes chaos. The cell swells, ruptures, and spills its contents into surrounding tissue, triggering inflammation and damaging nearby cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This destructive cascade often leads to chronic disease and tissue degeneration, especially when the body cannot repair the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global team of scientists looked at the role necrosis plays in many age-related conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood,” noted &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76122-keith-siew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Keith Siew&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s authors, hailing from &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/divisions/medicine/departments/centre-kidney-and-bladder-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL Centre for Kidney &amp;amp; Bladder Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kidney-heart-and-brain-diseases"&gt;Kidney, heart, and brain diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kidney problems&lt;/a&gt; affect many people in their later years. This organ filters toxins, and when enough kidney cells die, there is a higher chance of needing dialysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If necrosis is a major factor in triggering kidney damage, then targeting it might keep kidneys healthier for a longer time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that by 75 years old, nearly half of all individuals may experience some level of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222005923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest that necrosis may play a part in conditions like heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;. When cellular breakdown releases harmful molecules, surrounding tissues can become inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these tissues struggle, the effects may ripple through the body. Even mild inflammation can wear down the body’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-astronauts-and-necrosis"&gt;Astronauts and necrosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/living-in-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; find necrosis interesting because low gravity and cosmic radiation can strain human organs. Astronauts experience accelerated aging during long missions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys are especially vulnerable because reduced fluid regulation and radiation exposure may affect how well they &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-rule-of-biology-sai-proposed-to-explain-aging-and-how-to-control-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that interrupting necrosis could protect these vital organs has sparked new questions about maintaining astronaut health for extended journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration,” said &lt;a href="https://pure.southwales.ac.uk/en/persons/damian-bailey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Damian Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href="https://www.southwales.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and the European Space Agency Life Sciences Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-necrosis-may-protect-cells"&gt;Stopping necrosis may protect cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source,” said Dr. Carina Kern, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.linkgevity.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LinkGevity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe that if necrosis can be paused, it might stop a domino effect of tissue damage. By preserving cells that are on the brink of failure, the body would have a better chance to carry out self-repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis suggests that keeping calcium levels under control within cells could be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amaranth-seeds-rich-in-calcium-and-iron-prevents-tumors-and-keeps-bones-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; often acts as a switch, turning on or off important cellular functions. If too much enters a stressed cell, that cell can rupture. Scientists hope that preventing this surge might halt large-scale tissue breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-quality-of-life"&gt;Improving quality of life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Age-related disorders&lt;/a&gt; come with gradual but significant loss of function. Necrosis appears in conditions affecting not just the kidneys but also the brain, heart, and other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cells burst and release debris, surrounding tissues may endure ongoing inflammation. Interrupting this pattern could reduce suffering and add productive years for many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach might also allow doctors to address multiple health problems at once. Rather than chasing each disease individually, limiting necrosis may let the body maintain its own equilibrium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the population grows older, ideas like these could open up new possibilities for health management and medical innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blocking-harmful-cell-death"&gt;Blocking harmful cell death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers around the world are investigating whether necrosis-blocking drugs or gene-based therapies can be used safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aim to determine if these approaches can work without disturbing beneficial types of cell death that clear out defective or excess cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untangling these processes could be tricky, but the concept of sparing healthy tissues and preventing irreversible damage has captured wide attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more teams studying these pathways, the prospects for harnessing necrosis control are expanding. For now, public interest and continued clinical trials may help clarify how this form of cell death can be targeted effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to clinicians from the &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/divisions/medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL Division of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03431-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncogene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 21:23:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOMnFOSlZfZUNqUHN5SVU5UUNreExMTGNnS2h0WWN2dU11dG1vcFA5SlJkWkUxUEdyWklWcHJNZ2p6WXpzZjBBOHZfaXptWWRkSmlfcFo0XzU1UU8wV0t0Nzd2cXpySmllWXRkSmtEdzR6UTg0WE9pUGJ2dzlNcXYtMUNEYnNXakNuRFlBMVUyZlF1Rk83Y0NXU0ZHV1FITGppMkloZ1N2R1p4MlB1TEdpYXZtMA</guid></item><item><title>无论您是吸烟还是食用可食用的食物，杂草都可能对您的心脏有害- Live Science | Weed may be bad for your heart, whether you smoke or consume edibles - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbGswdmxPT1JvY0RZSlVKV2JWZmlsRklfNUZucjFRaDNINHdRX1IwR3lxQUQ3bkVDOFgtaDBDSThybXM1NFVKR2FnN1JEQlZHS3laaDNpbHVjYWJ4UXcxVWhrcHRtdjJsWlJ2Y0tQQWI4dS04UHJ2bG5oWFc4ajZTT1RtSjJXbHNiZU9mWldkeXRaSWJKS2NuSHh3UHd4NXBCZ24tbElSS2c0NVdEanc0czhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because eating a cannabis-infused brownie or gummy does not involve inhaling smoke, it may be tempting to think of edibles as a relatively harmless high. However, new research suggests that similar to smoking cannabis, consuming edibles containing the compound &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64886-thc-cbd-marijuana-therapeutic-effects.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64886-thc-cbd-marijuana-therapeutic-effects.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may worsen cardiovascular health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that "chronic smokers of marijuana have poorly functioning blood vessels similar to chronic smokers of tobacco," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/matthew.springer" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/matthew.springer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Matt Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiovascular researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) whose lab led the new study.

To isolate the effects of habitual cannabis smoking or edible use, the study focused on cannabis users who reported using the drug at least three times a week, exclusively through their preferred method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/leila.mohammadi" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/leila.mohammadi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Leila Mohammadi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a physician-scientist at UCSF, noted that their study's strict recruitment criteria resulted in a small sample size, which could somewhat limit the findings. However, it also enabled them to rule out other factors that could affect people's blood vessels, such as tobacco use or underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gauge each participant's vascular function, the authors temporarily blocked blood flow to the brachial artery — located in the upper arm — with an inflatable forearm cuff. They used ultrasound imaging to measure the artery's diameter before and after releasing this pressure. This measure is reflected as the percentage of diameter change from the baseline measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springer said this test offers a "window into the future" because if blood vessels cannot dilate properly in response to increased blood flow, that's linked to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864801" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864801" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;higher risk of poor cardiovascular disease outcomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants who did not consume cannabis, the researchers measured an average vessel dilation of 10.4%. By comparison, cannabis smokers and edible users had an average dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. This decrease in dilation is similar to what the researchers observed in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of chronic tobacco smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more cannabis people used — as defined by the number of smoking sessions or milligrams of THC consumed via edibles per week — the more dramatic their impairment in dilation was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover clues as to why cannabis might cause this change in function, the researchers ran a laboratory study to see how the participants' blood samples affected endothelial cells. These cells line blood vessels and release compounds, such as nitric oxide, that spur vascular dilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vessel-widening process can be triggered by a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). But when the researchers exposed endothelial cells in lab dishes to blood samples from cannabis smokers, they found that the blood hampered VEGF-stimulated nitric oxide production in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, blood from edible consumers and cannabis nonusers had no effect on the cells' nitric oxide release. That suggests that cannabis smoke and ingested THC affect the cardiovascular system via separate mechanisms. That idea is in line with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464788/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464788/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prior study from the same team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found that secondhand cannabis smoke that was stripped of THC still affected the blood vessels of rats that breathed it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study revealed only an association between cannabis use and vascular function, not definitive proof of how the drug affects blood vessels, Springer acknowledged. Meanwhile, one of his collaborators &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08998" target="_blank" data-url="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08998" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis appears to harden blood vessel walls but does not affect vascular dilation, whereas the current paper reports the opposite findings. So there's more research to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springer added that because they only recruited habitual users of the drug, people who consume cannabis less frequently may not be affected the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is becoming available to a growing number of consumers thanks to efforts to legalize the drug at the state level. However, research into its health effects has not kept up, Kloner said. Because the drug is still illegal at the federal level, cannabis studies remain constrained by strict regulation, making the drug more difficult to study, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4-GV4ePPhK2MtVdyEdpVFSiLX1pXwNG91N" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4-GV4ePPhK2MtVdyEdpVFSiLX1pXwNG91N slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using an advanced imaging technique called NODDI, scientists mapped the organization of neural pathways that govern emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that specific brain tracts were linked to increases in either positive or negative emotionality by nine months. Infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle displayed more positive emotions and better self-soothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Emotional Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; White matter structure at 3 months predicts emotional patterns by 9 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Forceps minor linked to negative emotionality; cingulum bundle linked to positive growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Imaging Standard:&lt;/strong&gt; NODDI imaging provides detailed insight into infant brain development previously unseen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Genomic Press research article, scientists have uncovered remarkable insights into how the earliest brain connections shape infant emotional development, potentially offering new ways to identify children at risk for future behavioral and emotional challenges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, led by Dr. Yicheng Zhang and Dr. Mary L. Phillips at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, examined 95 infant-caregiver pairs using advanced brain imaging techniques. Researchers discovered that the microstructure of white matter tracts – the brain’s information highways – at just 3 months of age could predict how infants’ emotions and self-soothing abilities would evolve over the following six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110629"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoding the Infant Brain’s Emotional Blueprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team employed sophisticated Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), a cutting-edge MRI technique that provides unprecedented detail about brain tissue organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology allowed scientists to peer into the developing brain’s architecture with remarkable precision, revealing how the arrangement of neural fibers influences emotional trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is that the brain’s structural organization in early infancy sets the stage for emotional development,” explains the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on critical white matter pathways connecting regions responsible for self-awareness, attention to important stimuli, and cognitive control – networks that form the foundation of emotional processing throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Discoveries Shape Understanding of Emotional Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed distinct patterns linking brain structure to emotional outcomes. Infants with higher neurite dispersion in the forceps minor – a bundle of fibers connecting the brain’s hemispheres – showed greater increases in negative emotionality between 3 and 9 months. This suggests that certain patterns of brain connectivity might predispose infants to heightened emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in executive control, demonstrated larger increases in positive emotions and improved self-soothing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries raise intriguing questions about whether early interventions could potentially influence these neural pathways to promote healthier emotional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Early Detection and Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify infants at risk for emotional difficulties before behavioral symptoms emerge represents a significant advance in developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has established that high negative emotionality in infancy correlates with increased risk for future anxiety and behavioral disorders, while low positive emotionality links to later depression and social difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Phillips notes the potential impact: “Understanding these early neural markers could transform how we approach infant mental health, allowing for targeted interventions during critical developmental windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team validated their findings in an independent sample of 44 infants, strengthening confidence in these brain-behavior relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Imaging Reveals Hidden Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s use of NODDI technology marks a significant methodological advance in infant brain research. Traditional imaging methods often struggle to capture the nuanced organization of developing brain tissue. NODDI’s ability to separate different tissue components provides researchers with a clearer picture of how neural pathways mature and organize during this crucial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research examined three major white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Each plays a vital role in connecting brain regions essential for emotional processing and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might variations in other brain connections influence infant development? What role do environmental factors play in shaping these neural pathways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging Neuroscience and Clinical Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have immediate relevance for pediatric care and early childhood development. By identifying objective neural markers of emotional development, clinicians could potentially screen for risk factors before behavioral problems emerge. This proactive approach could lead to earlier, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team accounted for multiple factors that might influence brain development, including caregiver mental health, socioeconomic status, and infant characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive approach strengthens the study’s conclusions and suggests that brain microstructure represents a fundamental contributor to emotional development independent of environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Directions and Unanswered Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings represent a significant advance, they also open new avenues for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How stable are these early neural patterns throughout childhood? Can targeted interventions modify white matter development to promote emotional resilience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s ongoing work aims to address these questions through longitudinal studies following infants into later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. During this time, rapid changes in white matter organization lay the foundation for lifelong emotional and behavioral patterns. Understanding these processes at a neural level could inform everything from parenting practices to public health policies supporting infant development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Era in Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research exemplifies the power of advanced neuroimaging to reveal previously hidden aspects of brain development. As technology continues to evolve, scientists gain increasingly sophisticated tools to understand how the brain’s earliest organization shapes human behavior and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh team’s findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that many aspects of emotional and behavioral development have roots in the brain’s earliest structural patterns. By identifying these patterns, researchers move closer to developing targeted interventions that could prevent or mitigate future mental health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications extend beyond individual children to broader questions about human development. How do genetic and environmental factors interact to shape these early brain patterns? What evolutionary advantages might different patterns of emotional development confer? These fundamental questions drive continued research in this rapidly advancing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates that even in the earliest months of life, the brain’s structural organization profoundly influences emotional development. This knowledge opens new possibilities for supporting healthy development from the very beginning of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this emotion and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b4b8b5b0f7aeb6b7be99bebcb7b6b4b0baa9abbcaaaaf7bab6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/gp025a.0026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Yicheng Zhang et al. &lt;em&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rapid changes in negative and positive emotionality (NE, PE) and emotional regulation (e.g., soothability) during the first year of life. Understanding the neural basis of these changes during maturation can enhance the understanding of the etiology of early psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to determine how measures of white matter (WM) microstructure in tracts connecting key emotion-related neural networks, including the forceps minor (FM), cingulum bundle (CB), and uncinate fasciculus interconnecting the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), can predict developmental change in infant emotionality and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) measures together with conventional diffusion tensor metrics to examine WM tract microstructure and fiber collinearity in the primary sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 95), and modeled each WM feature with caregiver-reported infant NE, PE, and soothability, with infant and caregiver sociodemographic factors as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 3-month infants, higher neurite dispersion and lower longitudinal fiber alignment in the FM were associated with a larger increase in NE from 3 to 9 months of age, suggesting that greater integration of the DMN, SN, and CEN leads to a larger subsequent increase in NE; while higher neurite density and dispersion as well as lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in PE, suggesting that greater integration within the CEN leads to increasing PE over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, higher neurite dispersion and lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in soothability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations among diffusion tensor measures and changes in infant emotionality and emotional regulation measures were replicated in an independent test sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that early infant WM microstructural features support infant emotionality and emotional regulation development and could represent early biomarkers of future emotional and behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:23:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE00czRQRHVHbF9uQk0xM0hhNjhIV0xFODFXUXAwQzZTUVhEU1hkQUFvRE9jUWt6N3dDdUYxRkpxUkxmeDVfX1JkYUtCd1JlMjc0SUduLXFFTHZkNlUtTU5XSE9NRk1JcjltcnpPaw</guid></item><item><title>一名妇女在冲洗鼻窦后感染了一种致命的脑食性阿米巴。以下是如何避免这种情况-《独立报》 | A woman contracted a fatal brain-eating ameba after rinsing her sinuses.

Here’s how to get rid of it"&gt;nasal irrigation&lt;/a&gt; device using non-boiled water from an RV’s water system at a Texas campground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman experienced “fever, headache, and altered mental status” within 4 days of using the nasal irrigation device. Medial professionals suspected that she had a primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM, &lt;a href="/news/health/hhs-bird-flu-vaccine-moderna-b2760126.html" title="HHS cancels funding for bird flu vaccine development because of RNA concerns"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was treated for PAM, but developed seizures and then died 8 days after her first symptoms appeared, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 lPcTk"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/18/42/Screenshot-2025-06-03-at-2-41-03-PM.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/18/42/Screenshot-2025-06-03-at-2-41-03-PM.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/18/42/Screenshot-2025-06-03-at-2-41-03-PM.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="An elderly woman from Texas has died after contacting a brain-eating ameba from rinsing her sinuses, the Centers for Disease Control said" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-45838"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;An elderly woman from Texas has died after contacting a brain-eating ameba from rinsing her sinuses, the Centers for Disease Control said&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Centers for Disease Control/Dr. James Roberts, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAM is a very rare, but almost always fatal, brain infection caused by brain-eating ameba known as Naegleria fowleri. Using tap water for nasal irrigation is a factor for PAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAM usually infects fewer than 10 people a year in the U.S., but almost everyone who is infected dies from it. Out of the 164 known people who got infected with PAM in the U.S. from 1962 to 2023, only four survived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC confirmed that Naegleria fowleri was found in the woman’s cerebrospinal fluid.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 90% of popular freshwater game fish in Southern California contain an introduced parasite capable of infecting humans, according to a new study by researchers at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/parasites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;parasites&lt;/a&gt; found in the study—two species of flatworms called trematodes—typically cause gastrointestinal problems, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; or lethargy when they infect humans. In some rare and severe cases, the parasites have caused strokes or heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf180/8154770" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that these parasites pose a previously unrecognized public health risk in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Americans don't usually think about parasites when they eat freshwater fish because it hasn't historically been an issue here," said Ryan Hechinger, an ecologist and parasitologist at Scripps and the study's senior author. "But these trematodes have now been widely introduced in the U.S. and that means that doctors and the public should be aware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hechinger emphasized that there is "no need to panic" as the risks posed by these parasites are easy to mitigate: Fully cooking fish or freezing any intended to be eaten raw for at least one week should kill the trematodes, per Food and Drug Administration guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a social media survey included in the study suggested that people in the U.S. are likely consuming freshwater fish without taking these precautions, which can dramatically increase the odds of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The study identified two species of parasitic trematodes—&lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-07-biologists-human-infecting-parasite-sterile.html"&gt;Haplorchis pumilio&lt;/a&gt; and Centrocestus formosanus. These trematodes have historically infected people in Southeast Asia and likely arrived in the U.S. more than a decade ago inside the bodies of one of their hosts: an invasive aquatic snail commonly known as the &lt;a href="https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=1037" target="_blank"&gt;red-rimmed melania or Malaysian trumpet snail (Melanoides tuberculata)&lt;/a&gt;. The invasive snail has spread to 17 American states and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trematode's life cycle involves parasitizing three hosts: first a red-rimmed melania snail, then a fish and then, finally, a warm-blooded vertebrate, like a bird or a human, that consumes the infected fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/parasites-associated-eating-fish-showing-southern-california-fishing-locales" target="_blank"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; led by Hechinger showed that the red-rimmed melania and its associated trematode parasites are widespread in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, Hechinger said he and his co-authors wanted to determine whether fish that Americans commonly catch and eat carry these infectious parasites, and whether people are consuming these fish in ways that increase their odds of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the researchers examined 84 fish from seven different species, including largemouth bass and bluegill, collected from five popular fishing locations in San Diego County.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that 93% of all the fish in the study were infected with the Haplorchis pumilio parasite, with some individual fish harboring thousands of the parasites. The second parasite, Centrocestus formosanus, was found at two of the five locations where it occurred in 91% of the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These parasites are here in the U.S., and they're infecting fish that people are eating," said Hechinger. "We hope this study can help make public health officials, doctors and the public more aware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study authors conducted a survey of 125 YouTube videos with a total of nearly 5 million views, and found 65% did not mention the proper cooking or freezing of the fish, which promotes the transmission of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nearly 5 million views shows there is widespread interest and possibly a widespread practice of folks eating freshwater fish raw," said Emma Palmer, a marine scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center who conducted the study during her graduate studies at Scripps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly cooking or freezing fish before consumption kills the parasites, and minor infections shouldn't cause serious harm. Greater health risks come from chronic, repeated infection over many months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that public education about the risk of infection and proper fish preparation is crucial, particularly among people who may rely on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/freshwater+fish/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;freshwater fish&lt;/a&gt; for food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The study authors plan to share their results with public health officials in several Southern California counties to increase awareness. The researchers also hope the study will reach &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+practitioners/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical practitioners&lt;/a&gt;, who might not think of these trematodes as a possible cause of gastrointestinal complaints or other problems in their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There haven't been any reported cases of these parasites infecting Americans," said Hechinger, "but nobody is looking for cases and doctors aren't required to report them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate more accurate tracking, the study authors recommend that fish-borne trematode infection be added to the list of diseases doctors are required to report to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This kind of research is so important to identifying new public health threats," said Hechinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hechinger and Palmer, the study was co-authored by Daniel Metz of the University of Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After years of largely predictable &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-cases-surging-parts-of-us-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-norovirus-strain-us-wave-stomach-bug/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;called GII.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; drove a record wave of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years," wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;since slowed&lt;/a&gt; to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined," the CDC researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, norovirus reports &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-19-2025/hpr-volume-19-issue-2-news-27-february-2025#:~:text=27-february-2025-,Update%20on%20increasing%20levels%20of%20norovirus%20activity%20in%20England%2C%20February,2)%20(Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-norovirus-and-rotavirus-surveillance-reports-2024-to-2025-season/national-norovirus-and-rotavirus-report-week-19-report-data-to-week-17-data-up-to-27-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;through April&lt;/a&gt;, far above GII.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, where GII.17 &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/8/16-1138_article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;previously drove&lt;/a&gt; a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo &lt;a href="https://idsc.tmiph.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/diseases/gastro/gastro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis — most from norovirus — that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/graaf-miranda-de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Miranda de Graaf&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global &lt;a href="https://www.rivm.nl/en/noronet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;NoroNet&lt;/a&gt; network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES2015.20.26.21178#html_fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;previously wondered&lt;/a&gt; if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season," de Graaf said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=benjamin-lopman-8568" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Benjamin Lopman&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen "when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave," Lopman said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A dangerous fungal pathogen has proven no match for what may be one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1200269"&gt;most useful plants in nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying the chemical properties of cannabis have found it kills one of the most dangerous fungal pathogens in the world – in a laboratory setting, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a species of fungus behind &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptococcosis/about/index.html"&gt;cryptococcosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/infectious-diseases/cryptococcosis"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be vulnerable to topical treatment with cannabidiol and cannabidivarin, compounds found in the plant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; gets to your central nervous system, it causes life-threatening meningitis," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabidiol-shows-promise-as-treatment-for-fungal-infections"&gt;explains biologist Hue Dinh&lt;/a&gt; of Macquarie University in Australia. "The mortality rate is very high, and it's really hard to treat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ygtX2nyexo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal pathogens pose a pretty significant threat to human health, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.120"&gt;around 300 species&lt;/a&gt; known to cause diseases in humans, with varying levels of severity. Because pathogens such as fungi and bacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2018.04.059"&gt;continually develop resistances to drugs&lt;/a&gt;, new treatment options are continually needed to keep them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy is to look at medications that have already been approved for human use for other ailments. Dinh and her colleagues turned their research to cannabis, isolating five compounds to test on &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; and a range of other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They isolated the fungal species in a lab, and applied the compounds. Cannabidiol (CBD), which is non-psychoactive, and cannabidivarin (CBDV), which is psychoactive, both killed &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; adroitly, acting even faster than current antifungal treatments. They were also effective at eradicating the fungal pathogens responsible for such conditions as jock itch and athlete's foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proteomics analysis revealed that the antifungal activity of CBD and CBDV was linked to destabilization of the membrane, alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, disruption of metabolic pathways, as well as selective involvement of mitochondrial-associated proteins," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0013081"&gt;the researchers wrote in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one thing to kill a fungus in a petri dish, but quite another to observe the treatment working in a living system. To test their findings further, the researchers turned to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_mellonella"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greater wax moth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-dxMTDzMLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2015.1135289"&gt;larvae of this moth&lt;/a&gt; possess an innate immune response that is similar to that of mammals. They are also inexpensive to obtain, have short lifespans, and require no special equipment to keep, making them an excellent model for large-scale studies of infectious pathogens and the treatments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moth larvae were given small burn wounds, and then divided into groups. One group was left alone with just the burn wounds as a control; the remainder were infected with &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, and treated with different medicaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was treated with CBD dissolved in dimethyl sulfide. Another group was treated with dimethyl sulfide without the CBD. Finally, the last group was treated using Amphotericin B, a medication used to treat serious fungal infections in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. The survival rate of the larvae treated with CBD was significantly higher than the survival rate of the larvae treated with the dimethyl sulfide alone, and also higher than the survival rate of the Amphotericin B group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-163523" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn-600x198.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The survival rate of larvae infected with &lt;em&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/em&gt; and given various treatments. (Dinh et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was nearly as high as the survival rate of the control group – the larvae that had not been infected with the fungus at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the treatment of infections that reach the lungs and brain is a bit more complicated, the result suggests that, at the very least, the topical application of cannabidiol might be effective at treating a range of fungal skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can demonstrate that these ones work well for common infections," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabidiol-shows-promise-as-treatment-for-fungal-infections"&gt;Dinh says&lt;/a&gt;, "you could actually just get some CBD oil and then rub it on your skin to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0013081"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She then realized that the blood came from her anus and thought it was a hemorrhoid. When she went in for a doctor to address it, she learned some worrisome news — she had Stage 3 anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The surgeon, she said, ‘It’s cancer and we found out it was not just one but two tumors,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e9cff2" class="body-heading"&gt;Fatigue and bleeding &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2022, DeVillers noticed she was bleeding a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was bleeding when I was going to the bathroom. At first, honestly, I thought perimenopause,” she explains. “I didn’t know the bleeding was coming from my tush. I thought I was getting my period again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She also felt exhausted, but thought it was to due being busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had started feeling more fatigued, but I was also traveling for work, so I chalked it up to that,” she says. “I was both fatigued and scared about why I was bleeding.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When DeVillers noticed the blood was coming from her anus, she reached out to her doctor, who consulted with a gastrointestinal doctor. They suspected DeVillers had a hemorrhoid and recommended Devillers try hemorrhoid cream. If her symptoms did not improve in three months, she should visit the GI doctor. Yet the intensity of the bleeding worried her and she wanted a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t non-stop. All of a sudden, I would have a gush of blood,” she says. “I really begged them to put me on a waiting list.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The office was able to schedule DeVillers for surgery to have the hemorrhoid removed in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When I came out of it, I was really groggy from the anesthesia, but I remember my husband was holding one hand and my doctor was holding the other hand,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s when the doctor broke the news that DeVillers had cancer. After determining that she had Stage 3 anal cancer because it had spread to her lymph nodes, doctors came up with a treatment plan that included IV chemotherapy “every couple of weeks,” plus radiation and oral chemotherapy for five days a week for six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really intensive,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-f695a4"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;While in the intensive care unit, Julia DeVillers didn't remember much of her stay. However, she kept taking selfies of her experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While treatment was supposed to last for six weeks, during week three following her second IV chemotherapy infusion, DeVillers “seemed to crash and burn.” Prior to week three, DeVillers had been working, visiting friends and family and walking into a doctor’s office without assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My colon got twisted and I was in excruciating pain,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then her symptoms intensified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I started vomiting neon green,” she says. “I went to the ER, and I collapsed and then next thing I knew I was checked into the ICU ... My whole system collapsed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;DeVillers spent the next five weeks in the intensive care unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I remember about two of them and the first week I think went fairly well. I was lucid. I was talking,” she says. “They were figuring out what’s going on, pumping me with fluids.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By the second week, doctors noticed her blood cell counts had plummeted and called her children because they were unsure how much time DeVillers had left. They also enlisted hospice care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was horrible for my family,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She felt her “body shutting down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I saw this dark tunnel and it had two pricks of white light,” she says. This lasted “a day or two and I felt darkness. I was very depressed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She received a blood transfusion. Soon, DeVillers began feeling better, and “the tunnel got lighter and lighter.” While she was in the ICU, she did not continue with chemotherapy. She lost about 30 pounds while there and was “really weak, very frail.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Even as sick as I was, they wheeled me into radiation,” she says. “My radiologist, I’ll forever be grateful for him. He said, ‘If we stop now, it could come back. But if we keep going to radiation … that’s what’s going to get rid of the tumor.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Three months after she finished treatment in August 2022, doctors told her they had “cautious good news” that there were no signs of cancer remaining, but they still worried about a lymph node that caused a visible bump on her abdomen. Six months after treatment, she was cancer-free. It took all that time for her to rebuild her strength from being in the ICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had in-home health care for months because I was hooked up to a food IV bag and I was still not allowed to eat,” she says. “I stayed in bed a lot but I could get up and walk. So that was wonderful.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bf8430" class="body-heading"&gt;Anal cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer differs from colorectal cancer even though they share some symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Colorectal cancer comes from the cells that line the inside of your GI tract, while anal cancer comes from the skin cells that are the same as the skin that is covering the rest of your body,” Dr. Emily Huang, a colon and rectal surgeon, and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, where DeVillers received treatment, tells TODAY.com. “The vast majority of anal cancers are associated with HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-3bd01b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Julia DeVillers experienced complications from treatment. Even when she was in the ICU and weak, she kept going to radiation, which helped eliminate her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;HPV, otherwise known as the human papillomavirus, is a common virus often spread through skin-to-skin contact. It can cause six types of cancer including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and throat cancer, according to past &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393?search=HPV" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com reporting&lt;/a&gt;. But these cancers can be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do a lot to prevent HPV-associated cancers through things like vaccination,” Huang says. “We do screening for HPV-related cancers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The HPV vaccine is 97% effective at preventing cancers associated with the virus because it protects people from developing six high-risk strains of HPV likely to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the things that (we) can do is actually get someone who’s not already vaccinated, vaccinate,” Huang says. “It gets the immune system revved up to help fight the infection that is the root cause for the cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of anal cancer are similar to colorectal cancer signs. Anal cancer symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump or mass on the anus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment for anal cancer includes radiation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about anal cancer is that it is actually very, very effectively treated by radiation therapy, specifically chemo radiation,” Huang says. “Those types of skin cells are highly responsive to radiation and so the majority of people who are diagnosed with anal cancer and undergo chemoradiation actually have a complete cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer “is pretty uncommon, though we don’t know with the rise of HPV-related cancer, in general, whether that’s going to change.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With the increase in colorectal cancer, Huang says patients are more comfortable talking about bleeding or bowel changes. Still, there’s a stigma associated with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I frequently get patients who come into clinic saying, ‘I was embarrassed to even talk about this,’” she says. “These bothersome and slightly embarrassing symptoms might be easy to chalk up to something much simpler (like hemorrhoids).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7254a0" class="body-heading"&gt;Overcoming the stigma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As a writer, DeVillers shied away from bawdy humor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m a children’s book author, and people would say, ‘Oh add a fart to the book.’ I’m like ‘Oh I’m squeamish. I don’t want to talk about farts and butt jokes,’” she says. “I’ve changed obviously my whole attitude for both awareness and dark humor of the situation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At first, she “felt really embarrassed,” when she was diagnosed with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-ca3fe5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;At first, Julie DeVillers felt ashamed of having anal cancer and called it 'tush cancer' or anything that sounded less embarrassing. Soon, she realized the importance of speaking up about anal cancer as rates of HPV related cancers are increasing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When people asked her about it, she would say, “’Yeah, I’ve got tush cancer.’ ‘Yeah, I’ve got ass cancer.’ Anything so I didn’t have to say anal and then I learned anal cancer is a different animal from rectal or colon cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s been three years since her diagnosis, and DeVillers scans and bloodwork have all been normal, which is “cause for a small celebration.” She joined the board of the HPV Cancer Alliance to raise awareness of the various cancers caused by the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Women get it. Men get it,” she says. “It’s all directly related to getting HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recently published her first book since her diagnosis, “Meet Me at Wonderland,” which has themes that came from her ICU stay. Doctors would ask her questions, such as, ‘What do you do for work,’ to test her lucidity. She answered she worked at Chuck E.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regularly eating a combination of fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains may reduce your risk of developing heart disease and Type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While phytosterols are found in all plant foods, the highest concentrations are found in unrefined plant oils, including vegetable, nuts and olive oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nuts such as almonds, pistachio and cashews; seeds such as pumpkin, sunflower and watermelon; whole grains such as oats and barley as well as legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and soybeans are also good dietary sources of phytosterols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound is also found in vegetables such as artichokes, broccoli, green beans, sweet potatoes and cauliflower as well as fruits such as pineapples, oranges, berries and bananas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers followed over 200,000 American adults for 36 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to periodically answer questionnaires on dietary intake to measure how much phytosterol-rich food they were consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their answers were then evaluated using a variety of statistical models to discover their likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the follow-up period, the researchers noted over 20,000 study participants developed Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d7287a20-4079-11f0-84c9-e91538c4e9b7"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and nearly 16,000 developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers suggest that eating a healthy diet rich in plant-based foods can help to prevent or delay heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed those who consumed about five servings of vegetables, three servings of fruit, two servings of whole grains and half a serving of nuts - all of which are high in phytosterols - per day were about 10 percent less likely to develop either conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But nearly no American reaches these benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also analyzed metabolites - products of metabolism - and other metabolic biomarkers present in blood samples from about 40,000 people to understand the effect of phytosterols on the calorie-burning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California, San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then another — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman started feeling intense anxiety and experiencing heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had hypertension and the heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Frightened, she went to an emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac workup determined that the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and Washington, D.C., now allow cannabis use for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as Washington, D.C., recreational use is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related ER visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons — to relieve chronic pain, insomnia or mental health issues. But evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of national survey data &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834781?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;published Monday in the medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous 30 days) had jumped among adults 65 and older to 7% of respondents in 2023 from 4.8% in 2021. Back in 2005, he pointed out, less than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;perceived risk of cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; has declined. One national survey found that a growing proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;erroneously thought it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to “wisdom customers” 55 and older. RISE Dispensaries ran a yearlong “cannabis education and empowerment” program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;which legalized nonmedical cannabis nationally in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, show climbing rates of older people seeking medical treatment for cannabis-related issues, both &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;in outpatient settings and in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis-related ER visits by those 65 and older rose&lt;/a&gt; to about 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019, from 21 in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults between 2008 and 2021, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;more than 26-fold among those 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;increased cardiac risk &lt;/a&gt;among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a significant proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis screen positive for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other substance-abuse disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (average age: 73) seeking care at Veterans Affairs health facilities, researchers found that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the past 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mild, moderate or severe cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance abuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed that compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a 23% higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk. It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products than the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Old Age is produced through a partnership with KFF Health News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s practice of nasal irrigation led to her death via brain-eating amoeba. In a recent case report, health officials described how she contracted a fatal infection of &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; through tainted tap water sourced from a recreational vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Federal and local health officials in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the unusual death last week in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The 71-year-old woman developed neurological symptoms days after using a nasal irrigation device and died only a week later. These infections, while rare, can be prevented through practical safety measures, such as only using sterilized water for nasal irrigation, officials say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shapeshifting amoeba&lt;/a&gt; that lives in soil and warm freshwater. It typically feeds on bacteria and isn’t dangerous to humans when it’s simply ingested. But when the amoeba enters our body through the nose, it can end up in the brain. Once there, the amoeba will literally feast on brain cells and trigger massive inflammation, causing a severe brain infection known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;primary amebic meningoencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the MMWR report, the previously healthy woman sought medical care with fever, headache, and altered mental status. Four days earlier, she had irrigated her nose with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Doctors quickly suspected PAM, but even with treatment, she developed seizures and died eight days after her symptoms began. The bizarre nature of her death then prompted an investigation by the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials tested both the water from the RV’s portable water tank and the nearby municipal water system the RV may have been connected to during the trip. Neither source tested positive for the amoeba, and officials were only able to sample the water 23 days after the woman’s exposure, so the environmental conditions may have simply changed by then. But they did find evidence that the RV’s water system wasn’t properly disinfected to prevent contamination, likely explaining how the amoeba found its way into the woman’s tap water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use of nasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards,” the officials wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PAM is very rare, with only around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/graphs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported since the amoeba was discovered in the 1960s, but it’s nearly always fatal once symptoms start. Most infections are typically caught when people get water up their nose while swimming in warm lakes. But the amoeba can also survive in drinking or recreational water systems, especially if they’re not properly sterilized. And there have been several cases of people getting infected through using contaminated tap water for nasal irrigation (irrigation is usually performed to clear the sinuses in people with allergies or respiratory infections).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say that PAM can be easily prevented through recommended nasal irrigation practices, which include only relying on distilled, sterilized, or boiled and cooled tap water for irrigation. This latest case also highlights the unique danger posed by improperly cleaned RV water systems. So Texas and federal health officials have now created an &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/178019#tabs-3the"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; for RV users to follow so they can lower their risk of PAM and other waterborne illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of looking at gene expression broadly, they zoomed in on the exon level—the building blocks that influence how proteins are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that gene activity differences were only apparent at this finer scale, not at the whole-gene level. The study revealed that disruptions in stress hormone regulation, dopamine signaling, and circadian rhythms are common to multiple disorders, including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-Level Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychiatric patients showed differences from healthy individuals only at the exon level, not the whole-gene level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in circadian rhythm, cortisol release, and dopamine pathways were common across disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Precision Psychiatry:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support classifying psychiatric disorders by biological mechanisms, not just symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Helmholtz Munich and the University of Sydney identified biological mechanisms that are shared across psychiatric disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the team analyzed postmortem brain tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area of the brain is the center for reasoning and emotions in the brain, and is often implicated in psychiatric disorders. Samples from affected individuals, most of whom were schizophrenia patients, and healthy controls were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study special: The research team combined several different layers of genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast to studies that look at gene expression as a whole, we analyzed the exon level to better understand the structure of the genes. This detailed approach gave us a better understanding of how genetic variation influences disease risk”, first author Karolina Worf explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exons are the essential, information-containing segments of a gene. In addition to providing the blueprint for building proteins, they also determine which versions of a protein ultimately arise from a gene. This happens through alternative splicing, a process that occurs in over 95 percent of human genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Differences at the exon level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the exon level in the analysis was an important step: While samples from psychiatric patients and healthy controls were not significantly different at the gene level, they were significantly different at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk of developing a psychiatric disorder seems to therefore not just depend on what genes you have, but how your genes are expressed”, Janine Knauer-Arloth, leader of the Project Group Medical Genomics at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team integrated different genetic data, including variations in individual base pairs of DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms), rare genetic variants and polygenic risk scores, which summarize a person’s disease risk by aggregating all relevant genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, the researchers discovered disruptions in pathways related to the circadian rhythm, the release of the stress hormone cortisol, and the neurotransmitter dopamine — across all three included disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show that psychiatric disorders share a common biological basis. In the long-term, this knowledge can help researchers to classify psychiatric disorders not only based on symptoms, but also based on biological mechanisms. This paradigm shift is significant a step towards more precise diagnoses and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anke Schlee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Anke Schlee – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03366-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Janine Knauer-Arloth et al. &lt;em&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia share genetic architecture, yet their molecular mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both common and rare genetic variants contribute to neural dysfunction, impacting cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the molecular effects of genetic variants on human cortical single-cell types using a single-exon analysis approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating exon-level eQTLs (common variants influencing exon expression) and joint exon eQT-Scores (combining polygenic risk scores with exon-level gene expression) from a postmortem psychiatric cohort (BD = 15, MDD = 24, schizophrenia = 68, controls = 62) with schizophrenia-focused rare variant data from the SCHEMA consortium, we identified 110 core genes enriched in pathways including circadian entrainment (FDR = 0.02), cortisol synthesis and secretion (FDR = 0.026), and dopaminergic synapse (FDR = 0.038).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional enriched pathways included hormone signaling (FDRs &amp;lt; 0.0298, including insulin, GnRH, aldosterone, and growth hormone pathways) and, notably, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes (FDR = 0.0028). These pathways highlight shared molecular mechanisms in the three disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-nuclei RNA sequencing data from three cortical regions revealed that these core set genes are predominantly expressed in excitatory neuron layers 2–6 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, linking molecular changes to cell types involved in cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate the power of integrating multimodal genetic and transcriptomic data at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach moves beyond symptom-based diagnoses toward molecular classifications, identifying potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBTYkNLTUJVWFdaT3k2cmliUzY3SThoUVFmUTNzLVFLQXpnb0lEUVBTanFFUzctUFl0cWUzRTd2S2ZYSkZLbFhEQjk4V3JLUF9fczFlUk1OdkhzQ3ZwV1N0UHRvNWVfMDBnSEtPcXBjOERvNkpU</guid></item><item><title>我鼓励我的丈夫在床上看到一个“支持小组”来解决他的问题。他们毒害了他的思想。- Slate Magazine | I Encouraged My Husband to See a “Support Group” for His Issue in Bed.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdy6g001j3b77mpms812n@published"&gt;My husband and I are both 67 and have been married/monogamous for 15 years. We are in reasonably good health, but for the last year, he has been struggling with erectile dysfunction, which we know is not uncommon at our age. He’s very reluctant to speak to our primary care physician about the problem, and I understand that it could feel awkward. I’ve suggested that he try having a telehealth meeting with a urologist, but I have yet to convince him. He has mild hypertension, so any medicinal options would need a doctor’s supervision. I encouraged him to seek an online support group, which he has done, but I am less than thrilled with the direction that support has taken.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdy8d001k3b77ogfq012t@published"&gt;He’s become convinced that he can overcome the ED without medical intervention if I help. Apparently that “help” involves porn star levels of endurance and aerobics. I’m open to almost anything—role playing, costumes, toys, etc. But I have asthma and arthritis, so a marathon session is not doable for me, and there are a couple of positions I can’t accommodate or maintain. Also, none of the techniques or positions he thinks might be beneficial are going to work if he can’t get an erection. We had a very satisfying sex life, even with my minor limitations, which have existed throughout our relationship, so I don’t believe my challenges are part of the problem. I think he’s looking for any and every solution that doesn’t require talking to a physician. I want to help, and I can see how much our lack of intimacy is bothering him (and me, too!), but I think he’s on the wrong track. I still believe he needs a doctor’s guidance, not a partner with adult film star abilities. If you agree, how do I convince him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyeo001n3b774pc0cuio@published"&gt;I’m so confused. As you point out, if the solution for your husband’s erectile difficulties requires acrobatic sex, how is he going to get hard enough to engage in that sex? I wish I knew what the support group members were telling him, so I’d have a better chance of understanding where this idea is coming from. That might be a good place to start, though. Is he willing to share some exact quotes or any web resources that group members are directing him to? Maybe there’s a communication error happening somewhere along the way, even between him and you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdygi001o3b77x9e0ezc0@published"&gt;Ideally, the two of you could take the pressure off of his penis (and your joints) and reconsider what sexual intimacy can look like. In the event that his ED is mental, in which case, medication is unlikely to change things, this shifting of focus can actually help erections occur. (I often recommend “pleasure mapping” as a way to start—&lt;a href="https://youtime.com/think/pleasure-mapping-a-guide-to-learning-what-you-like"&gt;you can get a quick overview on it here&lt;/a&gt;.) Regardless, the two of you would still be connecting physically. You can think of this as another instance of adapting to changing bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyij001p3b77fu3d70vq@published"&gt;That said, given his age and the fact of hypertension, medical intervention may actually be what’s required here. I’m somewhat surprised, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3357516/"&gt;given longstanding links between the two&lt;/a&gt;, that the doctors treating his hypertension haven’t directly asked about the state of his sexual health. So you might gently present him with some information about how often the two issues co-occur and underline the fact that this means his doctors have probably fielded similar inquiries in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyke001q3b77oya2dx1m@published"&gt;I’m curious, because of your speculation around awkwardness being a barrier to asking for help, whether you’ve listened to how your husband is feeling or what his reasoning is. Assumptions can make providing support much more difficult than it needs to be. Giving your husband the space to open up and share is your best chance of finding your way back to physical intimacy—whether that’s through helping him feel comfortable talking to his doctor or redefining the ways you engage in erotic contact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyof001s3b77q6mj7tns@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for nearly 20 years. I have never cheated on her, and we do not have an open marriage. Lately, however, I have had recurring fantasies about being seduced by and having sex with another woman. I haven’t said anything about this to my wife because I don’t want to upset her. The fantasies are becoming more pervasive, particularly when my wife and I make love. Is something wrong with me or my marriage?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyur001v3b778crlyb3p@published"&gt;I don’t know. People having fantasies, even about people other than their partners, isn’t wrong. According to research, such as the massive study Justin Lehmiller based his book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-What-You-Want-ebook/dp/B0776PYDNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell Me What You Want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on, these fantasies are pretty common. This in no way guarantees that there’s nothing wrong with you, or with your marriage, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyxt001w3b77d7jdhewn@published"&gt;So, think through it. Has there been anything else about your mind, or anything about your marriage, that’s been bothering you? If so, go ahead and address that for the pure purpose of taking action when you see an issue. If not, I wouldn’t worry about the state of either.&lt;/p&gt;

If that’s the case, it’s worth asking your wife whether she’s comfortable taking the lead sometimes. You can frame this as a simple desire and leave the fantasies about other women out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s hinted that he’d like to be more than friends. I don’t want to create awkwardness by asking him, and I hate myself for considering this, but in terms of sex, would our options be restricted to just hand and mouth stuff and using toys?&lt;/p&gt;

He may get hard in response to appropriate stimuli, which, just like men who aren’t paralyzed, will vary depending on the individual. It’s also possible that he doesn’t respond to stimulation but uses erectile support medication such as pills or injections. Or it may be the case that erections aren’t an option for him, and you’d be, as you put it, “restricted to just hand and mouth stuff” and toys.&lt;/p&gt;

While “being more than friends” might mean simply adding sex to your relationship, you’ll also want to consider whether dating is part of the desired package for both of you. If dating is on the table, there will probably be other discussions you two will need to have as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

And why do you hate yourself for questioning whether the sex your friend can engage in will be enough for you? Really think through these emotions. If you do decide to move forward, keep in mind that this first conversation—about whether penile penetration is possible—is only the start.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers used AI to analyze data from nearly 6,000 UK children, uncovering gender-specific vulnerabilities—boys were more impacted by smoking during pregnancy, while girls were more affected by early fussiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the need for gender-responsive early screening tools and preventive care policies. Experts emphasize the value of acting early, even before symptoms emerge, to protect children’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive AI:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning revealed 14 early-life risk factors that predict mental health challenges by age five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys were more sensitive to maternal smoking, while girls were more affected by infant fussiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Action:&lt;/strong&gt; The study supports preventive care investments during pregnancy to improve children’s mental well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers identified strong and often overlooked emotional and behavioural risk factors that can be predicted to be present in five-year-old children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of breastfeeding, low birth weight and maternal smoking during pregnancy are factors that can be used to react very early, even before the child shows symptoms,” says the study’s lead author, doctoral researcher Xu Zong from the University of Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders,&lt;/em&gt; used artificial intelligence to analyse data from nearly 6,000 children in a longitudinal study of UK households. The aim was to use pregnancy and newborn risk factors to predict emotional and behavioural difficulties in children at the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found differences between the sexes: boys were more affected by maternal smoking, while girls were more vulnerable to fussiness in infancy. According to the researcher, these findings highlight the need for gender-responsive approaches in early screening and policy design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are particularly relevant in a time when both concern for children’s mental health and demand for early intervention are increasing,” Zong says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ observations are based on machine learning and big data. Using an advanced AI approach, the study revealed complex relationships and classified the predictive significance of 14 prenatal and postnatal factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our results, greater investments should be made in preventive care right at the beginning of pregnancy,” Zong points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties are increasing worldwide. The study provides up-to-date information on how early life risk factors, which begin as early as pregnancy and the newborn, can shape children’s mental well-being years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new international study, led by researchers from the University of Helsinki, was conducted in collaboration with Stockholm University, Karolinska Institutet Sweden and the University of Essex (UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xu Zong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Xu Zong – University of Helsinki&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.04.167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Predicting children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties at age five using pregnancy and neonatal risk factors: Evidence from a longitudinal study of UK households&lt;/a&gt;” by Xu Zong et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties at age five using pregnancy and neonatal risk factors: Evidence from a longitudinal study of UK households&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood emotional and behavioral difficulties have a profound impact on later life outcomes, making it crucial to identify early-life risk factors that predict emotional and behavioral difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, much of the existing research has concentrated on diagnosing, rather than predicting, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and has often focused on adolescents rather than younger children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to construct an interpretable predictive model using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, aiming to identify key risk factors that influence children’s emotional and behavioral difficulties during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined maternal habits during pregnancy and parent-reported data on birth, breastfeeding and regulatory problems during the newborn stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlighted lack of breastfeeding, low birthweight and maternal smoking during pregnancy as the three most significant predictors of emotional behavioral difficulties. Other important factors were related to infant regulatory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity analysis revealed gender differences in predictive power, with maternal smoking during pregnancy being a stronger predictor for boys, and the amount of fussing in infancy having a greater impact on girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the importance of comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care, advocates for early screening of emotional and behavioral difficulties, and calls for gender-specific approaches in assessing and addressing emotional and behavioral difficulties in children.&lt;/p&gt;

Institute of Technology, also found another type of tinned pulse—black beans— had a similar cholesterol-lowering effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking of the findings, lead author Professor Morganne Smith urged those with high cholesterol to replace 'less healthy' options with beans—whether canned, dried or frozen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There are a lot of ways to incorporate beans into your regular diet as a cost-effective way to support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'You can blend them to add some thickness to a soup base, add them as a salad topping, or pair them with other grains like rice.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists believe pulses like chickpeas and beans may boost the levels of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which are thought to be helpful in clearing harmful cholesterol from the blood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584893/Keto-Diet-Study-Shocks-Doctors-Cholesterol-Heart-Killer.html"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is a waxy, fat-like substance that is essential for various bodily functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that eating chickpeas every day significantly improved cholesterol whilst black beans helped to reduce inflammation, pointing to a simple cost-effective way to lower chronic disease risk  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two types—&lt;span&gt;HDL, the good kind, and LDL, too much of which is considered unhealthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An excess of bad cholesterol has long been linked with serious health problems including heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because LDL can form plaques that build up and block arteries, limiting the supply of blood to and from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;An estimated 6.3 million people in the UK are thought to suffer from the condition, which left untreated can develop into type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-644a1a00-4073-11f0-ad1a-01862e9cf4ae" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; as well as heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 12-week study, the results of which were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, 72 prediabetics were analysed to see how introducing beans to daily diets affected their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Heart Foundation, diabetics are around twice as likely to suffer a stroke or develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies estimate that around three quarters of people with diabetes also suffer high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to eat either one cup of black beans, chickpeas, or rice—which was the control group—every day for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood samples were taken at the start of the study, half-way through and again six weeks later to track&lt;span&gt; cholesterol, blood sugar levels and inflammation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers also carried out a glucose tolerance test at the start and end of the study—measuring participants' response to sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the study those who ate chickpeas daily experienced a significant decrease in cholesterol levels, from 200.4mg per deciliter of blood at the start of the study, to 185.8mg at the end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Total cholesterol levels above 200mg/dl are considered high, while figures below this are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those eating black beans were also found to have lower levels of inflammation after 12 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Our study found that bean consumption helped significantly lower cholesterol and reduce inflammation in people with prediabetes.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Critically, Prof Smith advised people who want to introduce beans into their daily diets to be cautious of any additional ingredients commonly found in the products—such as salt or sugar, both of which have been linked with heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost six million people in the UK have diabetes, of which 90 pre cent is type 2, but charities estimate there 1.2million people are living with disease undiagnosed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They used the &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; method to insert an archaic variant of the GLI3 gene, which is linked to skeletal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rodents soon showed noticeably altered bone structures and other unexpected traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made possible by scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.h.kpu-m.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who introduced this ancient DNA segment to assess its role in shaping skeletal anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gli3-gene-and-skeletal-changes"&gt;GLI3 gene and skeletal changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the mice who were edited with the GLI3 gene displayed wider &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreating-the-face-of-dragon-man-harbin-skull-denisovans-an-ancient-human-cousin/"&gt;craniums&lt;/a&gt; than their unmodified counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some also presented a reduced number of vertebrae or unusual rib configurations that were consistent with the older genetic template. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew attention to the fact that these modifications were not random anomalies, but specific skeletal features pointing to structural changes once found in extinct hominins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hedgehog pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a key developmental system in mammals, did not show catastrophic disruption in these mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/gli3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;archaic version&lt;/a&gt; of the GLI3 gene quietly adjusted how early bone patterning genes behaved, sparing the animals from severe birth defects yet nudging their skeletons in unexpected directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-background-influences"&gt;Genetic background influences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists noted that these skeletal changes differed depending on each mouse’s broader genetic makeup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mice on one background strain showed extra rib formation at the 14th thoracic position, while others had scoliosis-like rib angles. A fraction exhibited quicker fusion of skull plates, prompting a larger skull shape over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, none of these mice exhibited polydactyly, a trait often linked to major GLI3 gene disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that the archaic variant managed to retain the gene’s essential functions while selectively modifying certain skeletal features, which likely mirrored developmental paths in archaic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-did-humans-start-talking-scientists-may-have-found-the-answer/"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-traces-of-the-gli3-gene"&gt;Modern traces of the GLI3 gene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular GLI3 variant, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;R1537C&lt;/a&gt;, still appears in some human populations outside Africa at rates between 3.7% and 7.7%, though it is much less common in other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that in ancient groups with smaller population sizes, these changes persisted through genetic drift rather than strict adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small-scale tests involving cultured human cells, the archaic gene shifted expression of certain downstream targets tied to bone growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings back the idea that a subtle but steady influence of archaic traits may endure in the broader human gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-views-on-ancient-dna"&gt;Views on ancient DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-denisovan-species-humans-lived-undisturbed-tibetan-plateau-160000-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, both prehistoric relatives of modern humans, occasionally contributed genes to our ancestors. The presence of archaic DNA in living humans has been linked to various traits, including some skeletal features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly edited mice offered a concrete glimpse of how small genetic differences might have forged physical contrasts among ancient populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082319/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPUM_1m.webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082309/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPMU_1s.webp" alt="Altered skeletal morphology of the mice carrying a Neanderthal/Denisovan type GLI3 variant(A) Structures of modern human or extinct hominins GLI3, wild type mouse Gli3 (Gli31540R), and mouse Gli3 with a Neanderthal/Denisovans variant (Gli31540C).

That statement highlights how subtle gene tweaks can mold skeletal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-gli3-gene-matters"&gt;Why the GLI3 gene matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLI3 protein sits at the crossroads of multiple developmental processes, but it is especially vital for shaping bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on the GLI3 gene have revealed its involvement in conditions where limb or craniofacial structures form atypically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those disorders arise when the gene is fully inactivated, a far cry from this single amino acid switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1225829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;examinations&lt;/a&gt; of other archaic DNA segments examined immunity and even pain responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This updated research extends such work into the realm of skeletal differences, showing that one minor coding change can produce noticeable effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also underscores how ancient DNA, when tested in living models, provides a clear window on long-lost biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skeletal-insights-from-extinct-dna"&gt;Skeletal insights from extinct DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists who work with extinct &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/115000-year-old-human-footprints-found-alathar-lake-arabian-peninsula/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; DNA rely on fossils and advanced genomics to piece together the puzzle of our origins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet skeletal remains alone cannot show how each gene variant behaved during development. Rodent models like these can fill that gap, offering a living system to track gene function in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights how archaic changes, buried in genetic code for tens of thousands of years, can still produce phenotypic impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if many such variations fell out of circulation, remnants linger in some modern genomes, adding subtle diversity to our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more investigation is needed to confirm whether this arcane variant ever delivered a clear advantage for extinct populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some evidence from biobank data suggests connections to spinal traits, but the small numbers make firm conclusions tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the success of this gene-editing work brings fresh awareness of our shared evolutionary links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new findings emerge, scientists will be better positioned to understand how each archaic segment contributed to the ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/homo-juluensis-new-human-species-vanished-just-fifty-thousand-years-ago/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form, and what it might still mean for people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2333268/bio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ako Agata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tadashi-Nomura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tadashi Nomura&lt;/a&gt; at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine who led this important and fascinating study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.03.547394v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPeHFPSm9NMkFYWHlJNzJObjIzblNBZVpfVWZHbTExVElzVG5nOUZKTlpOaUYwN3NsczRnQzhPeE1QZng0MkpCQ29qTlRPeW02X1l2UGVjcWtidU83UjRsNnNxY0l2c3V0dkpGZDVCaTJJS1lWRG5WMHA1a01Tbll3bGtKLTlNY3I0cHBrNVMwSjdDSkVUUHdPMTNxSkJ0ci1PS1VjblpNMTFXbEFSS29PeDhnZXF2My1NSmExLQ</guid></item><item><title>您的TRICARE搬家清单- TRICARE新闻室(.mil) | Your TRICARE Checklist for Moving - TRICARE Newsroom (.mil)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNXVrQXl4WmJNMWxrdTF2VzNoNGcyZHU2cnlSLUNUbUdOZXJlUzZlMUZ4SVc0WFIxenZYU3VVeXlmVG0wX0JxTnZCVnhKSXMxYUZUN18tS0t0Vk1kdGxKb21wTWNkelpaekxwcE1VcS1yMW9ZQ0JaT05nM0xTTTVpVWFodmUtNV9vYncyRjczaUc3UmZreFQtSWtVQmk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
            &lt;span class="dateline-text"&gt;
                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Are you preparing to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy &amp;amp; Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/regions"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Update your address and other contact information in the &lt;a href="https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Learn how your health plan options might change. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/HealthPlans"&gt;TRICARE health plans&lt;/a&gt; you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/PlanFinder"&gt;Plan Finder&lt;/a&gt; to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/ComparePlans"&gt;Compare Plans Tool&lt;/a&gt; to compare the features of different plans side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving is sometimes a &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/LifeEvents"&gt;TRICARE Qualifying Life Event&lt;/a&gt;. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/enroll"&gt;change your health plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get health services and request copies of your health records.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pcm"&gt;primary care manager&lt;/a&gt;, primary care provider, or specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any active &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/referrals"&gt;referrals&lt;/a&gt;? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/4170061/defense-health-agency-extends-referral-approval-waiver-through-june-30-for-west"&gt;current referral approval waiver&lt;/a&gt; in the West Region.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you move, call the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/regions"&gt;regional contractor&lt;/a&gt; for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/partners"&gt;TRICARE contractor&lt;/a&gt; for more information on requesting and transferring records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Fill prescriptions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/FillPrescriptions"&gt;filling prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After you move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Update your contact information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/deers"&gt;update your DEERS record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt; and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/Publications/Handbooks/tricare_for_life"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRICARE For Life Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you enrolled in the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/tdp"&gt;TRICARE Dental Program&lt;/a&gt;? You should &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/partners"&gt;call the TDP contractor&lt;/a&gt;, United Concordia, to update your contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Change your health plan within 90 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/lifeevents"&gt;TRICARE QLE&lt;/a&gt; or during &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/openseason"&gt;TRICARE Open Season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pcm"&gt;choose a new primary care manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor"&gt;Find a Doctor Tool&lt;/a&gt; to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you get prescriptions through &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/homedelivery"&gt;TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery&lt;/a&gt;? Be sure to update your mailing address with the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy"&gt;TRICARE Pharmacy Program&lt;/a&gt; contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to prepare your TRICARE coverage to move with you will help you and your family have a smooth transition. Visit the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt; page to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to data from 12 people who received the therapy as part of an expanded access program. Data from these cases also indicate jacifusen decreased nerve damage. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00513-6/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antisense oligonucleotide jacifusen for FUS-ALS: an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label case series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/causes-of-als/"&gt;causes of ALS&lt;/a&gt; aren’t fully understood, some cases are the result of genetic mutations. Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; gene are a rare cause of ALS, accounting for only 1 or 2 out of every 100 cases, but they tend to cause very aggressive disease with &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-als/"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; onset in adolescence or early adulthood. Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;FUS &lt;/em&gt;gene lead to the production of an abnormal FUS protein, which is thought to drive damage to nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacifusen, also called ulefnersen or ION363, is an experimental therapy designed to reduce mutant FUS production by interfering with how &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; is read to produce the protein. The therapy is administered by injection into the spinal canal, or an intrathecal injection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;‘We do not expect to see clinical improvement’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reported on the outcomes from 12 people with &lt;em&gt;FUS-&lt;/em&gt;ALS, ages 16-45, who received jacifusen as part of an expanded access program, which allows experimental therapies to be used outside of clinical trials. The participants received the therapy in tailored treatment protocols and for a median of 9.3 months. The main goal was to assess its safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy was generally well tolerated, with no serious side effects reported. The most common side effect deemed as possibly related to the therapy was headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most participants, levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) — a marker of nerve damage — decreased by up to 82.8% after six months of treatment. This differs from the typical progression of ALS, where NfL levels increase and remain elevated as the disease advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decreases in NfL, most patients continued to have worsening disease progression with jacifusen, with two notable exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One patient, a young woman diagnosed as a teenager, saw worsening disease progression for about the first year of treatment and her scores on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), a standard measure of disease severity, worsened from 28 points to 8 points over the first 16 months. But after that, her condition reversed course and, over the following year, her score rose to about 20 points, where it’s remained as of the latest follow-up. In concrete terms, this means she regained abilities she’d lost, including walking unaided and breathing without a ventilator. The woman is still alive and has lived the longest of any documented case of a person with symptomatic &lt;em&gt;FUS-&lt;/em&gt;related ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When testing new drugs for ALS, we do not expect to see clinical improvement,” Neil Shneider, MD, PhD, co-author of the study at Columbia University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084829"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. “What we’ve seen in one patient is really unprecedented functional recovery. It’s surprising and deeply motivating for us, the ALS research community, but also the community of ALS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Possibility of delaying disease onset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most participants started jacifusen when their symptoms were already quite advanced, but a man in his 30s started before he had any overt symptoms. He did have a family history of &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-related ALS and a mutation in the &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; gene, and tests indicated reduced electrical activity in his muscles, which clinicians determined were likely an early sign of disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man has been on jacifusen for three years and hasn’t had any symptoms. The electrical activity of his muscles also improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although we cannot be certain if or how [this patient] would have progressed clinically had he not been treated, this case suggests the possibility that jacifusen could be used in carriers of [ALS-causing &lt;em&gt;FUS &lt;/em&gt;mutations] to delay or prevent disease onset,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ionispharma.com/"&gt;Ionis &lt;span class="padding-left-05"&gt;Pharmaceuticals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/ionis-opening-phase-3-trial-ion363-antisense-therapy-for-fus-als/"&gt;sponsoring&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04768972"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04768972)&lt;/a&gt; of jacifusen in people with ALS who carry &lt;em&gt;FUS &lt;/em&gt;mutations. The participants will be given the therapy or a placebo, with the main goal being to assess its effects on ALSFRS-R scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now we are eagerly awaiting those results, which we hope will lead to the approval of [jacifusen],” said Shneider, an investigator on the Phase 3 study.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing on data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults, researchers found the strongest and most consistent protective effects among African American, Latino, and White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their diet over a decade experienced up to a 25% lower dementia risk, regardless of age. While results were less pronounced among Asian American and Native Hawaiian participants, the study reinforces that adopting a brain-healthy diet can benefit cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIND Diet Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Adherence to the MIND diet reduced dementia risk by 9% overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who improved their diet over time saw a 25% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Strongest effects observed in African American, Latino, and White groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the U.S. population ages and dementia cases rise, many people are asking whether it is possible to prevent this devastating disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, the answer may be on your plate: People who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were significantly less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110604"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg.webp 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg" alt="This shows food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet, which stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and also emphasizes proven brain-healthy foods like leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other healthy diets, although the relationship varied among five racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their adherence to the diet the most over time showed the greatest pattern of risk reduction. This beneficial relationship was seen similarly among younger and older groups, suggesting that there are benefits to adopting the diet at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer’s and related dementias,” said Song-Yi Park, PhD, associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park and colleagues analyzed data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who provided information about their diet as part of a research cohort known as the Multiethnic Cohort Study starting in the 1990s. Participants were between 45-75 years old at baseline and over 21,000 developed Alzheimer’s or related dementias in the years that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants who scored higher for MIND adherence at baseline had a 9%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower risk of dementia, with an even greater reduction—around 13%—among those who identified as African American, Latino or White. Baseline MIND diet adherence was not associated with a significant risk reduction among Native Hawaiian or Asian American participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the protective relationship between a healthy diet and dementia was more pronounced among African Americans, Latinos and Whites, while it was not as apparent among Asian Americans and showed a weaker trend in Native Hawaiians,” said Park. “A tailored approach may be needed when evaluating different subpopulations’ diet quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that differences in dietary patterns and preferences among racial and ethnic groups could play a role in the variation they observed in the dementia-diet relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Asian Americans also experience lower rates of dementia than other groups, it is possible that the MIND diet may not reflect the advantages of diets that are more common among this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park said that further studies could help to clarify these patterns and added that interventional studies would be needed to verify cause and effect since the study was based on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf6fefff2fadbf5eeefe9f2eff2f4f5b5f4e9fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nancy Lamontagne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nancy Lamontagne – American Society for Nutrition&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at NUTRITION 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE10LS1jWFN1Um9QNmlRS3NuTXI3enkxZHVZZC1ETUg1Zk92ZnY3M1pwSkp4WnRMY3h3bEZNS21pWldfOTA3aGZlY1Rja1NZWkNtNEVTRTlqV3lmRnRtVC1CZ1lBaGNzT1Bt</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在黑死病背后的细菌中发现的基因突变帮助瘟疫征服了世界 | Gene mutation found in the bacterium behind the Black Death helped plague conquer the world, scientists say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFA2VGZiOTR6emFON0lqRHRkS1lINUpBVDR4YzFIRU1CLThHaGxWQ0t4cThKUFdPV2cwMlZSbEU5V0N2aXdzYUowRXhqX3hIMURDVkk3SERrWTd4OXRRNDlBR0FZOWFONW9zWmtYYtIBckFVX3lxTFA4VXU4TXl1RVFiZ1ExSlNVMWNvaXluZWpMSGN2Mm9qTFJhQ0lMZmtGeW9DSTZGSGhtcVMwZ0hLMXZsVFh5dUV0T09QbGgxQklSNlZ2eUhEeld5N1V6X04zY3BuZEptbmMwX3FaOElrZkxhdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            One of the bleakest periods in medieval Europe was the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/world/plague-bacterium-strain-black-death-intl-scli-scn"&gt;plague pandemic&lt;/a&gt; known as the Black Death, which killed at least 25 million people in just five years. But the disease didn’t stop there. The plague adapted to keep its hosts alive longer, so it could spread farther and keep infecting people for centuries, and researchers now say they’ve discovered how.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10002356mpkwk5wfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which has been circulating among human populations for at least &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7920731/" target="_blank"&gt;5,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. The pathogen has fueled three major plague pandemics since the first century AD, and though its deadliest years appear to be behind us, plague hasn’t disappeared. Cases still occur a few times a year in Asia, South America and the United States and more commonly in parts of Africa,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and can be treated with antibiotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10003356mk3ki7mou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists are still searching for answers about how Y. pestis evolved and dispersed, but recent analysis of ancient and modern Y. pestis samples revealed how plague managed to persist among humans for hundreds of years after pandemic waves petered out. After an initial period of high infection rates and rapid mortality — killing infected people within three days — changes to just one gene in the bacterium produced new strains that were less deadly and more transmissible, according to research published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10004356m9ni2vni9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those weakened strains eventually went extinct; the dominant lineage of today’s Y. pestis is the deadlier variety, the study authors reported. However, these findings about historic instances of Y. pestis adaptation could provide important clues to help scientists and physicians manage modern plague outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10005356m243kon51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plague’s most common form is bubonic plague, which causes painful swelling in lymph nodes and spreads among people through bites from fleas hitchhiking on infected rats. An outbreak of bubonic plague from 1347 to 1352 in Europe famously killed about 30% to 50% of the continent’s population. But the earliest known bubonic plague outbreak — the Plague of Justinian — took hold in the Mediterranean Basin and lasted from AD 541 to AD 544. Another plague outbreak emerged in China in the 1850s and sparked a major epidemic in 1894. Scientists view modern plague cases as part of this third pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10006356mgsgt0w2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, scientists collected ancient samples of Y. pestis from human remains dating back to about 100 years after the appearance of the first and second plague pandemics, sampling remains from Denmark, Europe and Russia. After reconstructing the genomes of these plague strains, they compared them with older, ancient strains that dated back to the start of plague pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgk8fgi00023b6mp9q524ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also examined more than 2,700 genomes of modern plague samples from Asia, Africa, and North and South America. One of the study coauthors, Jennifer Klunk, is a product scientist at Daciel Arbor Biosciences, a biotechnology company in Michigan that provided synthetically created molecules for the experiments, but there was no financial gain associated with the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10007356mbtgwedhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that their newly reconstructed genomes from 100 years into the first two plague pandemics had fewer copies of a gene called pla&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which has been recognized for decades as one of the factors that made plague so deadly, according to the study’s co-lead author Ravneet Sidhu, a doctoral student in the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10008356mtlza671q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;encodes an enzyme that interacts with host proteins, “and one of the functions that it carries out is in breaking down blood clots,” Sidhu told CNN. This ability helps Y. pestis spread into the host’s lymph nodes, where it replicates before attacking the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10009356mgzp0oz8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Not every function of this gene is fully known,” Sidhu added. However, prior studies by other researchers linked pla to severity of illness caused by both bubonic and pneumonic plague — an airborne form of the disease that affects the lungs, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000a356mb1yx7iuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the reconstructed strains showed fewer  copies of the pla  gene, the scientists were still uncertain      whether that would directly affect how deadly the  disease could be. So they tested strains of reduced-pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bubonic plague on mice, and found that survival rates for this type of plague were 10 to 20 percent           higher in those experiment  subjects than in mice infected with Y. pestis that had a normal amount of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. It also took the reconstructed bubonic strain about two days longer to kill its  hosts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000b356msvxr0j11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The paper presents a strong argument that depletion, but not total loss, of Pla (the enzyme produced by the pla gene) is part of the evolution of the plague pathogen and may help explain the decline of plague in the second pandemic commonly known as the Black Death,” said Dr. Deborah Anderson, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at the University of Missouri’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Anderson, who was not involved in the new research, investigates the virulence of plague, and these findings could shed light on transmission patterns in modern cases, she told CNN in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000c356me2g7o1p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our laboratory studies the   flea-rodent cycle and we have collaborators who conduct field research in   areas that experience annual or occasional plague outbreaks in the   wild,” Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000d356m1mr8wtww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are nearly 300 rodent species that can transmit Yersinia pestis, and today, burrowing rodents such as prairie dogs or ground squirrels are considered key animal hosts that experience outbreaks of disease,” she added. “After reading this paper, we will pay closer attention to Pla in the future to see if there continues to be a role for its expression in driving the explosive outbreaks of plague in the animal populations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000e356ml4cx4wqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mathematical models suggested how this might have played out in human populations centuries ago, leading to an “epidemic burnout” about 100 years after a bubonic plague outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgklmmh00043b6myjmulbtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a pandemic’s early stages, infections were swift, and death came quickly for both rats and humans. Over time, as dense rat populations thinned out, selective pressures favored the emergence of a less deadly strain of Y. pestis, with fewer copies of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. Rat hosts infected with this new strain would have a little more time to carry the disease, potentially enabling them to infect more rats — and more people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000f356mxaj6cbqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They  suggest a model that can be readily pursued in the laboratory that may help  explain the spread of plague today in the wild,”      Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000g356mgbjx0hyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These weaker strains of the disease eventually sputtered out and went extinct. In the modern samples, the researchers found just three examples of strains with reduced pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;genes, from Vietnam: one from a human subject and two from black rats (Rattus rattus).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000h356m0wilemye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been able to do this really cool interdisciplinary study between the modern and ancient data and marry these things that have been happening throughout (the plague’s) long evolutionary history,” Sidhu said. “It could be interesting to see how future researchers continue to try and bridge that gap between the modern third pandemic and those first and second ancient pandemics, to see other similarities. Because there aren’t a lot of ancient pathogens that we have as much data on, as we do for Yersinia pestis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000i356moygu9gfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the unusual features of plague pandemics is their persistence, and understanding how Y. pestis changed its infection patterns and survived over time could shed light on the adaptive patterns of modern pandemics such as Covid-19, she added.

In some cases, seizures occurred up to 10 years before an FTD diagnosis, highlighting a potentially overlooked early symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed over 12,000 medical records and found that epilepsy was more frequent in FTD patients compared to those with Alzheimer’s or healthy controls. These findings suggest that better screening for epilepsy in FTD could improve diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Early Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Epileptic seizures can occur up to a decade before FTD diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; FTD patients had significantly higher rates of epilepsy than those with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing seizures may improve function and life quality in FTD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Eastern Finland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to a recent study, in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), epileptic seizures are significantly more common than previously known. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery deepens understanding of the symptoms of this memory disorder and emphasises the importance of taking epileptic seizures into account in the treatment and monitoring of patients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." class="wp-image-110600" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinated by Neurocenter Finland, this major project by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu examined the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research dataset is one of the largest in the world, and the results have been published in the prestigious &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology &lt;/em&gt;journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilepsy occurred years before the FTD diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. The newly published study fills this information gap and shows that epilepsy is considerably more common in patients with FTD than previously estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analysed patient data from the university hospitals of Kuopio and Oulu from the period 2010–2021. Out of a total of 12,490 medical records, the study identified 245 patients with FTD and 1,326 patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to examining the prevalence of epilepsy in these patients, the prevalence was also examined in healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that epilepsy is considerably more common among those with FTD than those with Alzheimer’s disease or in healthy controls,” says Doctoral Researcher Annemari Kilpeläinen, the first author of the research article and a medical specialist in neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is noteworthy that epilepsy occurred in some patients with FTD already ten years before their dementia diagnosis, and it was more common in all the examined stages of the disease than previous international studies have reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of epilepsy was assessed at several time points from ten years before to five years after the dementia diagnosis. In patients with FTD, the prevalence of epilepsy increased over time, and five years after the diagnosis approximately 11% had epilepsy. In addition to epilepsy diagnoses, medications used for epilepsy were more common in patients with FTD, which strengthens the reliability of the results.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilepsy might be left undiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing epilepsy in patients with FTD may be challenging as the symptoms of the disease may resemble epileptic seizures. This may lead to underdiagnosis and delays in treatment. However, untreated epilepsy can significantly worsen patients’ condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying epilepsy is important because its treatment can improve patients’ functional capacity and quality of life. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and FTD raises new research questions: do these diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms and could some FTD symptoms be caused by alterations in the specific electrical systems of the brain”, says the project’s principal investigator, Associate Professor and Director of UEF Brain Research Unit Eino Solje.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An extensive research project brings together different fields of science&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently published study is part of an extensive project that combines exceptionally extensive real-life patient data with different kinds of unique registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project involves a strong cooperation between the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland as well as different fields of science, including between researchers in the fields of medicine and law. Kuopio University Hospital and Oulu University Hospital are part of the international European Reference Network &lt;em&gt;EpiCARE&lt;/em&gt; and recognised centres in the field of epilepsy treatment and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this epilepsy and FTD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#93fef2f9bde5e6fce1e1f6d3e6f6f5bdf5fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maj Vuorre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uef.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Eastern Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Maj Vuorre – University of Eastern Finland&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prevalence of Epilepsy in Frontotemporal Dementia and Timing of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Annemari Kilpeläinen et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevalence of Epilepsy in Frontotemporal Dementia and Timing of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have described a potential association between epilepsy and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but no systematic data are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether epilepsy is more prevalent in patients with FTD than in healthy controls (HCs) or patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case-control study, we compared the prevalence of epilepsy and purchases of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) among patients with FTD, matched HCs, and patients with AD from 2 early-onset dementia diagnostics centers in the same geographic regions of Finland. AD or FTD diagnoses were made between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from January 26, 2024, to January 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was to describe the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD, covering the time period from 10 years before to 5 years after the FTD diagnosis. We used &lt;em&gt;International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision&lt;/em&gt; codes to identify all patients with epilepsy and tracked purchases of ASMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study cohort included 245 patients with FTD (121 female [49.4%], 124 male [50.6%]; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [8.7] years), 2416 matched HCs (1190 female [49.3%], 1226 male [50.7%]; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.5] years), and 1326 patients with AD (777 female [58.6%], 549 male [41.4%]; mean [SD] age, 71.7 [9.8] years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of epilepsy was higher in the FTD group compared with the HC group (3.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002) and AD group (3.3% vs 1.4%, respectively; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01) 10 years before FTD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the year of the diagnosis, the prevalence was 6.5% in patients with FTD, 1.8% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 4.7 percentage points [ppt] [95% CI, 2.2-8.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), and 5.0% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 1.6 ppt [95% CI, −1.2 to 5.5 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .32); at 5 years after the diagnosis, the prevalence was 11.2% in patients with FTD, 2.2% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 9.0 ppt [95% CI, 5.0-14.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), and 6.9% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 4.2 ppt [95% CI, 0-10.0 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASM purchases were made significantly more often among patients with FTD (10.2%) compared with HCs (1.8%) and patients with AD (4.2%) (FTD vs HC difference, 8.4 ppt [95% CI, 5.2-12.9 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; FTD vs AD difference, 6.1 ppt [95% CI, 2.6-10.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) at all time points and increased during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case-control study found a higher prevalence of epilepsy and increased ASM use among patients with FTD compared with HCs and patients with AD , suggesting an association between epileptic abnormalities and the pathophysiology of FTD. Further studies are warranted to investigate a potential overlap in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:38:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBYYmpEQTVoRGpfWmhhRnBhVFk5OVNrNmVGVzBQdFA4RTdfZGJjLWhBb3BhWl81V2FkNDlfS21xbTByeThPY2hZeGNVZmsxLS1fM1pTQ1hkM29aSC1YUjl4M1BVemM2YmFEblE</guid></item><item><title>为什么美国饮食如此致命？沉默的杀手安静地伤害数百万人-印度国防评论 | Why the American Diet Is So Deadly?

&lt;p&gt;Guillaume Raineri, a forty-two-year-old former HVAC technician from Gonesse, a small town just north of Paris, found himself facing an unexpected challenge when he moved to the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;. The food in his new home, Bethesda, Maryland, where his wife worked at the &lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/strong&gt;, was different—larger portions, more salt, and excessive sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Curious about the effects of this new &lt;strong&gt;diet&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri enrolled in a four-week &lt;strong&gt;study&lt;/strong&gt; at the NIH Clinical Center designed to investigate why the American diet leads to such high rates of &lt;strong&gt;weight gain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Controlled Experiment in the NIH Metabolic Ward&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest hospital dedicated to scientific &lt;strong&gt;research&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri spent his days in a room fitted with a narrow hospital bed, a blue recliner, and an exercise bike. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/why-is-the-american-diet-so-deadly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, each morning, afternoon, and evening, he was served large meals—around two thousand &lt;strong&gt;calories&lt;/strong&gt; each—and could eat as much as he wished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For the first week, his diet consisted of minimally &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/the-worlds-leading-longevity-expert-reveals-four-foods-he-would-never-eat-they-are-a-recipe-for-failure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71418" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like salads, vegetables, and grilled chicken, and he reported feeling well. But as the weeks progressed, researchers switched him to ultra-processed foods—chicken nuggets, fries, and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. “They just sat in my stomach,” Raineri said. He experienced heartburn, &lt;strong&gt;bloating&lt;/strong&gt;, and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, Raineri underwent regular metabolic tests, including time inside a &lt;strong&gt;metabolic chamber&lt;/strong&gt; measuring how his body used energy and burned calories. The researchers also tracked his eating speed and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/every-dog-owners-dream-a-drug-that-could-add-more-years-to-your-best-friends-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71880" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hormone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;related to appetite. The findings were clear: on the ultra-processed diet, participants like Raineri consumed about five hundred more calories daily, gained weight, and showed metabolic changes including higher &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Redefining Nutrition: The Role of Food Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hall, the study’s principal investigator and a former physicist turned nutrition researcher at NIH, challenged the traditional focus on nutrients like salt, fat, and sugar. Instead, his research emphasized the impact of industrial food &lt;strong&gt;processing&lt;/strong&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are often chemically modified, containing ingredients that cannot be made in a home kitchen. Hall explained, “We’re starting to learn that processing really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This concept, introduced by Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro, categorizes foods into four groups based on processing. Group 1 includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like nuts and vegetables. Group 4 encompasses ultra-processed products, which include &lt;strong&gt;additives&lt;/strong&gt;, preservatives, and artificial substances designed to enhance flavor, shelf life, and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While critics argue that the category can lump together very different products—like canned beans and gummy bears—the growing body of research links ultra-processed foods to higher risks of high blood pressure, heart attacks, certain cancers, and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/married-to-an-ai-chatbot-women-opens-up-about-their-deep-bond-and-unique-sex-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80872" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health &lt;/a&gt;issues such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/24-year-olds-controversial-theory-on-gen-zs-depression-goes-viral-sparking-heated-debate/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73744" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The effects are often attributed to factors like energy density and &lt;strong&gt;hyper-palatability&lt;/strong&gt;—the irresistible combination of fat, sugar, and salt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unraveling the Gut Microbiome’s Response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlighted how ultra-processed foods affect the &lt;strong&gt;microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, the community of bacteria living in our digestive system. Katherine Maki, a clinician and microbiome researcher working with Hall, described how a lack of dietary &lt;strong&gt;fiber&lt;/strong&gt;—consumed by ninety-five percent of Americans—causes beneficial bacteria like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to consume the gut’s mucus lining instead, potentially leading to &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners found in many “no-sugar-added” products can further disrupt gut bacteria, impairing the body’s ability to regulate sugar. This decline in microbial diversity has coincided with the global spread of &lt;strong&gt;Western diets&lt;/strong&gt; and may contribute to broader health problems beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Industrial Food Production and the Gray Area of Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Seviroli Foods’ headquarters an hour and a half east of Manhattan, the production of pasta and sauces illustrated the complexity of food processing. Franco LaRocca, the company’s corporate chef and vice-president of research and development, described how the factory produces millions of pounds of stuffed pasta annually, using enriched &lt;strong&gt;semolina flour&lt;/strong&gt; mixed with ingredients like guar gum and cornstarch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LaRocca noted that while their products are processed, Seviroli limits additives and avoids &lt;strong&gt;hydrogenated oils&lt;/strong&gt;. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University, explained that industrial production alone does not define ultra-processed foods: “It has to have the purpose of replacing real food… and, usually, to be loaded with additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Nestle emphasized that some products, such as whole-wheat breads made from highly processed flours, fall into the ultra-processed category despite appearing healthy. She compared whole-fat &lt;strong&gt;yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;, made from milk and bacterial cultures, to low-fat versions that include emulsifiers and thickeners, highlighting the nuances in processing and health impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Navigating the Challenge Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH study and subsequent research have sparked debate among nutrition experts. Walter Willett, a prominent Harvard professor and critic of the ultra-processed food classification, described some studies as “misleading” and cautioned against oversimplifying dietary recommendations. Yet, the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in the American diet—estimated to be about two-thirds of what people eat—raises questions about their role in public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts to regulate ultra-processed food consumption, including marketing restrictions and &lt;strong&gt;taxation&lt;/strong&gt;, are being explored in some countries, but the complex relationship between diet, biology, and the food industry remains a challenge for scientists, policymakers, and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Women between the ages of 50 and 65 who scored high on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were 16% more likely to die from any cause, even after adjusting for health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association was not observed in younger or older women. Researchers suggest this may point to hormonal or metabolic changes in midlife that influence vulnerability to sleep-related health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Daytime sleepiness was only linked to mortality in women aged 50–65.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantified Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High Epworth scores raised mortality odds by 16% in midlife women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings hint at unique hormonal or metabolic factors in this age group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality in middle-aged women but not in younger or older women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that the adjusted odds of all-cause mortality were 16% higher in women between the ages of 50 and 65 years who had high scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, compared with women who had normal levels of sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sitting down." class="wp-image-110596" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and comorbidities. No significant associations were observed in younger women or older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying middle age as a critical period suggests clinicians should prioritize an Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment and excessive daytime sleepiness management in women approaching their 50s and early 60s,” said lead author Arash Maghsoudi, who has a doctorate in biomedical engineering and is an instructor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleepiness is a critical patient-reported outcome that is associated with increased risk for adverse health effects and diminished quality of life, according to an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement. Excessive sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake and alert during the major waking episodes of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 40,250 female veterans from 1999 to 2022, focusing on individuals who had a sleep disorder or had received sleep-related care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sample had a mean age of 48 years. Clinical notes were analyzed to extract scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a validated natural language processing tool that assesses the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep during routine daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It implies hormonal, metabolic, or resilience factors that warrant mechanistic follow-up for women in middle age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health; the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety, which is a combined Baylor College of Medicine Section in the Department of Medicine and a VA Health Systems Research Center of Innovation funded by a center grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the Michael E.

While having too much sodium is linked to high blood pressure, potassium causes you to lose sodium through your urine, Dr. Chang explains. &lt;br data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Not only that, potassium can help to ease tension in the walls of your blood vessels, lowering blood pressure as a result, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen, M.D.," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While decreasing sodium may also be necessary, adding more potassium can be an easier dietary tweak for some people to make, Dr. Chang says. “Lowering blood pressure by decreasing sodium intake can be difficult and may be unsuccessful because of the high sodium content in modern diets and many of the foods available to us in supermarkets,” he says. “Blood pressure lowering may be greater with potassium intake because the addition of potassium-rich foods may be an easier adjustment for people to make than the elimination of high sodium foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-potassium-do-i-need" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How much potassium do I need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Recommended potassium intakes vary slightly by person. However, most adult women should aim to have 2,600 milligrams of potassium a day, while most adult men should strive for 3,400 milligrams daily, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).

That’s why it’s important to have a personalized conversation with your healthcare provider, but some of those changes may include getting regular exercise, trying to maintain a healthy weight, getting good quality sleep, and doing your best to control your cholesterol and blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Together, those are the best chances people have of keeping their blood pressure under control,” Dr. Chen says.

The results were then submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for confirmation and received on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs produced after the signs of the virus did not enter the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/poultry-at-hickmans-family-farms-tests-positive-for-avian-flu"&gt;poultry at Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/a&gt; was infected.

At that point, the farm said it had lost more than one million egg-laying hens (20% of its flock) at one of its farms due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sick Bird Hotline: If you see signs of illness in your poultry, report them immediately to USDA at 1- 866-536-7593. You can also contact your local cooperative extension office, local veterinarian, or your State Veterinarian. For wild bird illness, please contact the Arizona Game and Fish Department.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Women who drank regular coffee were more likely to avoid chronic disease, cognitive decline, and physical impairment later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits did not extend to tea or decaffeinated coffee, while soda consumption was associated with worse aging outcomes. Researchers emphasize that moderate coffee consumption may be a helpful part of an overall healthy lifestyle but note that genetics and other factors play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Source Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Only caffeinated coffee—not tea, decaf, or soda—was linked to better aging outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modest Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Each additional daily cup of coffee in midlife correlated with a 2–5% higher chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; More soda intake was tied to a 20–26% &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings from a new study of almost 50,000 women followed for 30 years suggest that a morning cup of coffee might do more than boost energy; it could also help women stay sharp, strong and mentally well as they age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that women who drank caffeinated coffee in midlife were more likely to exhibit healthy aging. However, the researchers didn’t find any links with tea or decaf coffee, while drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110588"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman drinking coffee." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, BSc, HBSc, RD, MSc, PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, and an adjunct professor at University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee—not tea or decaf—may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study has several key strengths,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to the large sample size and 30 years of follow-up, we assessed several different aspects of longevity and healthy aging as well as very comprehensive information on nutritional and lifestyle habits that were collected every four years after the initiation of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 47,513 women from the Nurses’ Health Study with dietary and health data collected since 1984. The researchers assessed caffeine intake using validated food frequency questionnaires that included consumption of top contributors of caffeine such as coffee, tea, cola and decaffeinated coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of follow-up, the investigators estimated how the likelihood of healthy aging changed for every 80 mg of caffeine that study participants consumed per day. They also examined specific drinks like coffee, tea, decaffeinated coffee (per 8-ounce cup) and cola (per 12-ounce glass).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These preliminary analyses accounted for other factors that might influence healthy aging such as body weight, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, education level and protein in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2016, 3,706 of the women in the study met all the requirements for being considered healthy agers. In mid-life, ages 45-60, these women typically consumed an average of 315 mg of caffeine per day — roughly the amount in three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of that caffeine came from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women in the healthy agers group, each extra cup of coffee per day was tied to a 2% to 5% higher chance of doing well later in life, up to five small cups per day, or about 2.5 cups according to today’s measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find any significant association between drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea with an increased likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each additional small glass of soda—another major source of caffeine—was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that not all sources of caffeine confer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy aging, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that, in general, up to two cups of coffee per day should be safe and potentially beneficial for most people. Beyond that, drinking more may offer additional benefits for some but may not be healthy for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, Dr. Mahdavi and colleagues have shown that genetic variation can influence the relationship between caffeine intake and health outcomes, so more caffeine isn’t always better, particularly for people with lower caffeine tolerance or specific genetic susceptibility (Mahdavi et al, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, coffee contains a range of compounds that could act synergistically to influence aging pathways. To better understand these effects, researchers plan to investigate how specific bioactive compounds in coffee interact with genetic and metabolic aging markers, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could guide personalized medicine approaches to develop diets that support longevity and cognitive health for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee can be harmful for thousands of people who take common medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes those on thyroid medication, SSRI antidepressants, drugs for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-15ba0f90-4072-11f0-8a0e-7dc8da85b0d6"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and even over-the-counter decongestants for cold and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-15bb4810-4072-11f0-8a0e-7dc8da85b0d6"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The energy-boosting drink can also make life-saving heart medication less effective, increasing the risk of a deadly irregular heartbeat, according to pharmacy expert at Kingston University, Dipa Kamda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in other cases, caffeine can interact with prescription drugs, causing a range of debilitating symptoms such as insomnia, headaches, fast heart rate, raised blood drowsiness, confusion, and even stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While your morning brew might feel harmless, it can interact with certain medicines in ways that reduce their effectiveness, or increase the risk of side-effects,' warned Dipa Kamda, writing for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;The Conversation.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From common cold tablets to antidepressants, caffeine's impact on the body goes far beyond a quick energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coffee may be part of your daily routine, but it’s also a potent chemical compound that can influence how your body processes medicine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine is a stimulant that speeds up activity in your brain and nervous system, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee is dangerous for thousands of people on common medications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular cold and flu medicines, like Sudafed, contain a decongestant called pseudoephedrine, which also has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you combine this with the caffeine in coffee, the effects can be amplified, causing jitters, restlessness, headaches, fast heart rate and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining caffeine with pseudoephedrine can also raise blood sugar and body temperature, particularly important for people with diabetes, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With many cold medications already containing added caffeine, drinking coffee can increase the risks further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk also applies to those taking stimulant medications to treat ADHD, like amphetamines, or asthma drugs such as theophylline, which has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist warned: 'Using them together may increase the risk of side-effects such as a rapid heartbeat and sleep disruption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also added caffeine in some branded over-the-counter painkillers, such as those containing paracetamol or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee can speed up how quickly the drugs are absorbed and while this helps them work faster, it can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant found in dozens of cold and flu medicines on the shelves &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It could raise the risk of side effects like stomach irritation, or bleeding,' said Ms Kamda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Although] no serious cases have been reported, caution is still advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee while taking some types of medicines to control irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or blood pressure is known to make them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Kamda added those with heart conditions don't have to stop drinking coffee entirely, but may want to 'consider limiting intake or switching to decaf'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you drink coffee immediately before or after taking thyroid medication like levothyroxine, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt; absorption of the drug can fall by up to 50 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain and constipation, to return 'even if you’re taking your medicine correctly,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is recommended those taking the medication should wait 30 to 60 minutes before eating or drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this is most common with tablet forms of levothyroxine, and less likely with liquid forms, Ms Kamda pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This timing rule also applies to a class of medications used to treat osteoporosis and other bone conditions called bisphosphonates, including alendronate and risedronate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also make the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant, selective serotonin inhibitors, for example sertraline and citalopram, less effective, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;lab studies have found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drinking coffee with the older and less commonly used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such amitriptyline or imipramine, can tirgger side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist, with 17 years experience, explained: 'TCAs are broken down by the liver enzyme CYP1A2, which also metabolises caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The competition between the two can slow drug breakdown, increasing side-effects, or delay caffeine clearance, making you feel jittery or wired longer than usual.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problematic ingredient in coffee, caffeine, can also be found in a cup of tea, a can of Coca Cola, and even in green tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist added: 'Everyone metabolises caffeine differently. Some people feel fine after three cups, while others get side-effects after just one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pay attention to how your body responds and talk to your pharmacist or GP if anything feels off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you’re ever unsure whether your medicine and your coffee are a good match, ask your pharmacist or doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A short conversation might save you weeks of side-effects or reduced treatment effectiveness, and help you enjoy your brew with peace of mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Open your eyes, reach for coffee and sip. That warm first gulp seems to shift your brain into gear. But what if it also helps you stay sharp and strong as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what new research suggests. Scientists followed almost 50,000 women for 30 years. They found something unexpected. Women who drank regular coffee during midlife were more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; well – physically, mentally, and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drinking-coffee-linked-to-healthy-aging"&gt;Drinking coffee linked to healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on women aged 45 to 60. Researchers measured their caffeine intake and followed their health over the next three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to know who would reach age 70 without serious disease, memory problems, depression, or physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end, 3,706 women met those goals. Most of them drank about 315 milligrams of caffeine per day. That’s roughly three small cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea, soda, and decaffeinated coffee didn’t show the same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-biological-age-may-predict-dementia-risk-better-than-birth-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. But with each extra cup of regular coffee, chances of healthy aging rose by 2 to 5 percent. The benefit topped out around five small cups a day – or 2.5 modern-sized mugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi is also an adjunct professor at &lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee – not tea or decaf – may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-coffee-helps-you-age-well"&gt;Not all coffee helps you age well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why coffee and not tea? Researchers aren’t sure yet. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds besides caffeine. Some of those might protect the brain, muscles, or metabolism. Or maybe it’s just the amount of caffeine people get from coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a twist. Another study led by Dr. Mahdavi looked at how coffee affects the kidneys. This time, the answer depended on your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this second study, researchers tracked over 600 young adults in Italy. Everyone had early signs of high blood pressure. None were on medication. The scientists also looked at a gene called CYP1A2. This gene controls how fast your body breaks down caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-decide-if-coffee-helps-or-harms"&gt;Genes decide if coffee helps or harms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people break down caffeine quickly. They have the AA version of the CYP1A2 gene. Others process it slowly – they have the AC or CC versions. This second group makes up nearly half the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For slow metabolizers, coffee came with risks. Heavy coffee drinkers in this group – those drinking over three cups a day – had a much higher chance of developing kidney problems as they &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow metabolizers were 2.7 times more likely to develop protein in their urine. Their risk of kidney hyperfiltration doubled. The chance of developing high blood pressure went up 2.8 times. Fast metabolizers? No extra risk. They seemed to tolerate coffee just fine, even at higher amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the present cohort study, caffeinated coffee intake was associated with increases in the risks of albuminuria, hyperfiltration, and hypertension only among slow metabolizers of caffeine, suggesting that caffeine may play a role in the development of kidney disease in susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-habits-shape-long-term-health"&gt;Habits shape long-term health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this does not mean you should quit coffee. The risks apply mainly to people who metabolize caffeine slowly and drink large amounts. For most people, two cups a day should be safe – and possibly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi. “Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, coffee is not a magic drink. It helps a little. Healthy habits matter more. Still, it’s good news if you already enjoy your daily brew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-personalized-diet"&gt;Building a personalized diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present her findings at &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Her team now plans to study how the chemicals in coffee interact with genes and aging pathways. The goal is to understand who benefits most and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, your genes might help build a personalized diet. One that supports your brain, protects your kidneys, and keeps you moving as you age. Coffee might be part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you take that first sip of coffee in the morning, pause for a moment. That warm, familiar drink may be doing more than simply helping you shake off sleep or sharpen your focus for the day ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-coffee-might-help-you-age-better"&gt;Daily coffee might help you age better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to growing research, especially if it is caffeinated coffee, your daily cup might be quietly contributing to a healthier, stronger version of yourself in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start seeing coffee as a miracle cure, take a step back. Coffee can support well-being, but it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. If you want to age well – staying active, mentally sharp, and free from chronic illness – then coffee alone won’t carry you there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to move your body regularly and need to eat meals that nourish, not just fill. You also need to understand how your body responds to substances like caffeine, because your genes play a role in how well coffee works for you – or whether it causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging doesn’t come from a single habit, drink, or moment. It’s the result of years of daily decisions that seem small at the time. Over the decades, those small decisions build something powerful. Coffee can be one of them, but it is not the only one. Keep choosing well, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog is based on research presented at NUTRITION 2025 and a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:18:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNjFrUl9YNVlZcnVwNDBVQ3dRQVlqS05WWDFNcm94RkFrSGZzbUxWbnlad3RNQ2N4RXdiLUtHa1dKMmo2VkxIejR0UXdaY3lqZDE2dG43N0hZTHZEa0h0angza2dYbDJkRy1QcWtQNGhHaWs4bE8wM21PM3FIemJFVTFoVzRObVJ3Unh6TWxXT3lKb3ZRd2Jv</guid></item><item><title>全身运动游戏显示出对自闭症儿童的希望- PsyPost | Whole-body movement play shows promise for children with autism - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOSlI0R0xmblZhT2hVUkpUTzBscTNkWHV5Rk9Vd3pxeFh2cWtPRjJuQnhiTEhFQlhyWjhVb2lkM29MT0hmZHlzdFU1cF9RaEtHWHFOeVlGRkJlaDFHRW1DZ2tJbFRJVnpGZnFoeW5iVVVXZG9ta1UzOU1RV0hCUDBSaUtRTjZPaHM5U3FmMHBBMnlXZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new pilot study suggests that play-based, whole-body movement activities may help children with autism spectrum disorder improve their self-control and reduce certain negative behaviors. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2025.2465600" target="_blank"&gt;Disability and Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, show that a movement-focused intervention led to faster responses on a test of inhibitory control and fewer sensory and disruptive behaviors, while a more traditional sedentary play program had no such effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts socially, and processes the world. Children with autism often experience co-occurring challenges beyond the core symptoms, including difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviors, unusual sensory responses, and problems with executive functioning. Executive functions are the mental skills that allow people to plan, focus attention, and control impulses. One important aspect of executive functioning is inhibitory control—the ability to stop oneself from acting impulsively or to ignore distracting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children with autism, impaired inhibitory control has been linked to a range of behavioral difficulties, including repetitive actions, difficulty transitioning between tasks, and problems with aggression or self-regulation. However, traditional interventions often focus on sedentary, desk-based activities and may not fully address these overlapping challenges. The research team behind this study wanted to test whether a more dynamic, physically active intervention could produce benefits across cognitive and behavioral domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Standard autism interventions do not always incorporate gross-motor activities during therapy, and mainly focus on sedentary play to improve speech and fine motor skills,” said study author &lt;a href="https://sites.udel.edu/abhat/" target="_blank"&gt;Anjana Bhat&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Delaware. “Hence, as a pediatric physical therapist, my research focuses on understanding how whole-body movements through creative movement or general exercise facilitate motor, social, and cognitive skills in autistic children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers recruited 40 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The children ranged in age from 5 to 14 years, with an average age of about 8.5. Participants were matched in pairs based on their age and verbal abilities and then randomly assigned to one of two groups: a Movement group or a Sedentary Play group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children in the Movement group participated in whole-body, play-based activities designed to be engaging and physically active. These included yoga, obstacle courses, dance, and games that involved throwing, catching, or navigating space. Meanwhile, children in the Sedentary Play group engaged in activities like arts and crafts, building with blocks, or reading—activities that required fine motor skills but did not involve large physical movement. Both groups received 16 sessions across eight weeks, delivered either in person or via telehealth, depending on family preference and pandemic-related constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the intervention, all participants completed a computerized version of the Flanker task, a test commonly used to measure inhibitory control. In this task, children were shown rows of cartoon fish and asked to quickly identify the direction that the middle fish was pointing, even when the surrounding fish pointed in the opposite direction. The researchers measured both how fast and how accurately the children responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team videotaped early and late training sessions and coded how often the children displayed sensory-seeking behaviors (such as sniffing objects or covering their ears), repetitive behaviors (like hand-flapping or rocking), and negative behaviors (such as aggression, noncompliance, or tantrums).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, the researchers found a moderate link between children’s performance on the Flanker task and their behavior during the sessions. Specifically, children who took longer to respond during the task tended to show more negative behaviors during play. This suggested that difficulties with inhibitory control may be associated with real-world behavior problems in autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the intervention, children in the Movement group showed meaningful improvements in their performance on the Flanker task. Their reaction times became significantly faster, indicating improved inhibitory control, even though their accuracy had already been high and remained steady. In contrast, children in the Sedentary Play group showed no change in reaction times or accuracy after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavioral observations also revealed important differences between the two groups. Children in the Movement group showed a significant drop in negative behaviors from the beginning to the end of the training period. They also showed a trend toward fewer sensory-seeking behaviors. However, there was no change in the frequency of repetitive behaviors, possibly because these behaviors were harder to distinguish from typical movement patterns in an active, music-filled play setting. In the Sedentary Play group, no changes were observed across any of the behavior categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that physically engaging, playful activities may support both cognitive and emotional development in children with autism. The improvements in inhibitory control were not only measurable on a standardized task but also seemed to translate into fewer disruptive behaviors during the sessions. This supports the idea that executive functioning and behavioral regulation are interconnected, and that interventions targeting one may influence the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents of autistic children/youth should provide their child opportunities for regular creative movement (e.g., dance/music and movement, martial arts, yoga) or general exercise (e.g., walk, jog, tag, outdoor play, or sport) around 1 to 1.5 hours,” Bhat told PsyPost. “Such regular physical activity has the potential to improve their child’s attentional focus, executive functioning, socialization, and would give them a sense of belonging/achievement, when done solo at home or in a small group format in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that physical activity may enhance executive functioning by increasing blood flow and brain chemicals associated with attention and arousal. Movement-based play may also offer emotional and sensory benefits by helping children self-regulate through rhythmic motion and creative expression. While the current study focused on whole-body movement in a structured yet playful format, the team notes that these activities could be easily adapted for home and school settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are limitations to the study that should be considered. The sample size was relatively small, and although it reflected the higher prevalence of autism in boys, it included only a few girls. This makes it difficult to know whether the same benefits would be seen in autistic girls or in children with different levels of support needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pilot study that requires further validation through large sample studies in the future,” Bhat noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers plan to expand their work with a larger, community-based trial. They aim to investigate how movement-based play can be integrated into everyday routines to support the motor, social, and emotional development of children with autism. They also hope to explore whether such interventions offer long-term benefits for mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Upon receiving funding, we would like to conduct a large-scale, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of community-based, whole-body movement interventions offered to autistic children,” Bhat explained. “Creative movement capitalizes on autistic children’s predilection for creativity and makes movement fun. Engaging children in fun and moderate intensity physical activity will improve their overall motor, social and cognitive development as well as long-term mental and physical fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2025.2465600" target="_blank"&gt;Effects of Movement and Sedentary Play interventions on executive functioning and their relationships with sensory, repetitive, and negative behaviors of children with ASD – a pilot RCT&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by W.

I pulled out a pair of pajama pants, and the pocket was greasy with two ruptured softgels of cod-liver oil I’d forgotten to remove. The whole load reeked like a cast-iron skillet of seared salmon. I was furious I could be so stupid and careless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrq600173b776nkt9al3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;I’d taken my lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, the generic version of Vyvanse, that morning, just as I had almost every day since I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/paris-hilton-adhd-music-video.html"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; a month earlier at age 35. The first time I swallowed the yellow capsule, I proceeded to paint my home office in two coats of White Dove, the result of a euphoric burst of energy that felt entirely new to me. The morning of the fish-pill incident, though, I felt so tired that I took a nap. I did not feel at all like I’d ingested a stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrrs00183b77tfnx6p9x@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;I blamed myself for my low energy and lack of focus. Maybe I hadn’t slept well or eaten enough protein — or something? But a month later, I was again overwhelmed with fatigue, paralyzed by small tasks, and hating myself. And again the month after that. I realized my meds seemed to stop working right before &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;my period began&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrtn00193b779hs8h0kk@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Hormonal fluctuations in ADHD symptoms aren’t rare (on Reddit, a cadre of women commiserate over taking high doses of stimulant drugs that seem to work no better than sugar pills), but the scientific community has been slow to recognize them. One study found ADHD diagnoses in women ages 23 to 49 nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022, and another found a 14 percent increase in stimulant prescriptions for women and girls 5 to 64 between 2020 and 2021. That uptick has likely prompted more complaints about period-related dips in drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrva001a3b77nmieyfbh@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;Although just a handful of researchers are investigating the trend, a theory surrounding it has emerged: When estrogen is high, dopamine (the mood-regulating brain chemical that ADHD meds like Ritalin and Concerta boost) is also high, says &lt;a href="https://www.drellenlittman.com/"&gt;Dr. Ellen Littman,&lt;/a&gt; a psychologist who has worked with high-IQ women and girls with ADHD for more than 35 years. People with ADHD have dysregulated dopamine functioning, so when their estrogen level drops (typically, right before the menstrual bleed begins), they feel the loss of its compensatory effect on their dopamine levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrxb001b3b77dx8ua98x@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;“This is what we clinically see,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eunetworkadultadhd.com/author/sandra-kooij/"&gt;Sandra Kooij&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist working in the Netherlands and the founder and chair of the European Network Adult ADHD. She says doctors can’t measure dopamine, but they can measure estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs00001c3b77jzdoksej@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Formal research on women’s hormones and ADHD is scarce. The current theory largely builds on a 2017 study that followed 32 women with regular periods and found ADHD symptoms worsened when their estrogen levels were low. But the vast majority of ADHD research is male-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs24001d3b77kmm2f4ot@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;This has led to a care crisis for women. Within the medical community, there’s no consensus about who should treat a female ADHD patient with symptoms that present differently depending on where she is in her cycle. These women tell me they often bounce among gynecologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists and are sometimes given additional diagnoses, like anxiety, depression, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In 2021, Kooij and her collaborators published a study suggesting that women with ADHD experienced more frequent and severe hormone-related mood disorders compared with the general population. “I had to consider, &lt;em&gt;Why is this happening?&lt;/em&gt;” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs8y001e3b77bkhsh89n@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;Carmen, a 38-year-old mother of three in Michigan, realized her period seemed to be rendering her 40-mg. of Vyvanse ineffective after she saw a TikTok that described her symptoms. She had previously attributed her lack of concentration, short fuse, and exhaustion to her multiple sclerosis and PMS. Carmen’s primary-care doctor has suggested she take a stimulant booster dose on the days she needs it but also  cautioned that there’s not much research to back that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Every month, she tells me, she turns into “an idiot,” becoming extra forgetful and hot-tempered. “Three kids asking me different things at the same time,” she says. “I can handle it on other days that I feel more clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjscj001g3b771j0h3jwa@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In a 2023 study building on her earlier work, Kooij and colleagues found that increasing the dosage of ADHD meds the week before menstruation improved inattention, irritability, and energy levels for all nine of their research participants. It was a small sample size, but it furthered Kooij’s hypothesis that clinicians could improve women’s symptoms if they treated both their hormonal and their neurological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsex001h3b77agow9lap@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;“It’s important for the treating physician to look at the individual’s needs,” says &lt;a href="https://learningcenter.unc.edu/services/ldadhd-services/burnett-seminars/dr-patricia-quinn/"&gt;Dr. Patricia Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, a retired developmental pediatrician who co-founded the National Center for Girls and Women with ADHD. Some struggle with focus and energy for two weeks before their period, while others notice the problem only for a few days, and still others struggle the entire time they are bleeding. In her practice, she adjusted her patients’ stimulant doses and regulated their hormones with birth control.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of recognizing that their worsening ADHD symptoms may connect to cyclical hormonal changes, women might blame themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes-fleming-83b277225"&gt;Jes Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, a holistic PMDD specialist, says many of her clients are riddled with shame and guilt, which transform into “negative self-talk, low self-esteem, self-harming behaviors, and suicidal ideation.”&lt;/p&gt;

Months later, she realized her period was affecting her meds. When I call her, she is in the middle of a premenstrual stretch and doesn’t feel like her Adderall is working. She’s also preparing for a trip to her native St. Thomas. “I’m really trying to regulate my mind and body, but my medication isn’t helping the way I need it to right now,” she says. “It sucks because I travel Monday and have so much to do before then.” She also says she’s very sensitive right now, taking everything personally. People aren’t responding to her messages. She just had her room tidied by a professional cleaner, and now, a week later, it’s a disaster again. Aniska says she’s not really upset about the mess. She’s upset with herself for being unable to maintain order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsnn001k3b77msqi98vd@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;Self-criticism is common in women with ADHD, and it can escalate into crippling fear and chronic worry. Anyone can launder fish-oil pills, but I constantly make errors — forget I’m doing laundry, create DOOM piles (“didn’t organize, only moved”), abandon side hustles. Those missteps erode my confidence and mutate into intrusive, depressive thinking that stop me from being functional. One of my biggest problems is a fear of my husband dying. Once a month, this passing thought overwhelms me and I play out his death in detail, imagining the make of the car that will hit him, whom I’ll call first. It’s anxiety, sure. But here’s the thing: When my meds work, I don’t ponder his demise. I just think about what’s for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjspo001l3b77nu7xbese@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;To add to the chaos, there’s still&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/adderall-shortage-adhd-medication-ascent-pharmaceuticals.html"&gt; a stimulant shortage&lt;/a&gt;, so every month I have to ask my doctor to resend my prescription to multiple pharmacies until we find one that has a 30-day supply of 20-mg. pills. Given this ongoing challenge, I haven’t broached adjusting the dose to match my hormonal dips — or explored whether my health insurance would cover this kind of variation. Plus when I told my doctor that my meds felt less effective around my period, she was a little curious but didn’t have much to say. Hormones, she told me, don’t factor into how she manages treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

But why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t have an “envelope” (an outer layer of lipids/fats that many viruses have). This outer layer can be disrupted by alcohol, which causes them not to work, Tetro explained. But when viruses are non-enveloped, the alcohol has a harder time getting into the virus, and “it gets repelled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For bacteria, certain types “can form spores, which protect [them] in harsh environments,” Leung added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of spores like a tank, Tetro said. The inside of the bacterium is protected by this strong material on the outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Alcohol may do some damage, but simply will not break through all the layers,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Clostridium difficile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which causes the colon to be infected and severe diarrhea) is an example of this kind of bacterium that can survive against hand sanitizer, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, some parasites that have a “tough outer shell” are also resistant to alcohol, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cryptosporidium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cryptosporidium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is the leading cause of waterborne illness in the U.S., has a cell wall-like a “bomb shelter” that “fully protects the inside structure,” Tetro explained. Using alcohol “would be like throwing a ping pong ball at it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when should you opt for hand-washing instead of using hand sanitizer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-washing is always preferred when possible, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Soniya Gandhi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Soniya Gandhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate chief medical officer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But it’s important to use “proper technique” for it to actually work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Lather [and] scrub [your] hands to create friction … [Scrub] for at least 20 seconds,” Gandhi advised. “Dry [your] hands thoroughly after washing well because wet hands can more easily transmit germs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you don’t have access to soap and water, using hand sanitizer is the next best option, she said. Here’s how to use it properly to maximize effectiveness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. “These higher concentration sanitizers are more effective at killing germs than those with lower alcohol concentrations,” Gandhi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squeeze the appropriate amount of sanitizer on your hands. “Use enough … to keep the hands wet for 15-20 seconds while you’re rubbing,” Tetro said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoroughly rub it into both of your hands. “Not just [on] the palms but [also] in-between the fingers,” Leung added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not wipe off the sanitizer. Let it dry on your hands, Gandhi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just remember that hand sanitizer doesn’t work against all germs. Leung especially recommends washing your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, before eating and preparing food, after handling garbage, and after coughing or sneezing into your hands. Also, handrubs aren’t effective at removing harmful chemicals or when your hands are visibly dirty or greasy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget about these other simple ways to avoid sickness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These tips can provide an added layer of protection from getting infected by germs, including those that are alcohol-resistant:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your hands aren’t clean, avoid touching your face. “Surfaces such as [your] eyes and mouth have mucous membranes and easily serve as port[s] of entry” for germs, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, like door handles and light switches, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think that’s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,” noted Quinton. Meaning, it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to prioritize your fiber consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here’s what experts say: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we’re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,” explained Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also good for the removal of toxins: “If there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said &lt;a href="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary Ellen Camire" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Mary Ellen Camire&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is often prebiotic, meaning it’s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="rebuild and balance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;rebuild and balance&lt;/a&gt; your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon” against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. “And when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can’t cross that barrier,” Quinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don’t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: fcafotodigital via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;fcafotodigital via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Beans and legumes are a high-fiber meal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can eat more fiber:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camire added that it’s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mistake a lot of people make when they decide ‘I’m going to make fiber a priority’ is they don’t give their system time to adjust. If you’re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they’re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,” Camire said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won’t be difficult or expensive,” Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fiber supplements don’t cut it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,” Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, “they don’t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,” Quinton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond fiber intake, there’s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colonoscopy-before-45-signs_l_65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="early colonoscopy screening" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;early colonoscopy screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

					&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s body changes after reaching 50 years of age, and dealing with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;stubborn belly fat&lt;/a&gt; is always a challenge. If you need help with this, you’re in luck. We spoke with &lt;b&gt;Scott “Spirit” Herman&lt;/b&gt;, certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.lifetime.life/locations/mn/plymouth.html" target="_blank"&gt;Life Time Plymouth (Minnesota)&lt;/a&gt;, to learn the only workout routine that seems to melt belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into specifics of Scott’s workout plan, it’s important to address why belly fat is so common after turning 50. The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/get-rid-of-the-middle-aged-spread-exercises/" target="_blank"&gt;middle-age bulge&lt;/a&gt; can be caused by fad diets, hormonal changes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“I believe 100% [of] it is lifestyle—what and how we eat, where we work, and how much we move. Lack of sleep is a factor as well, and leads to bad choices with food, screen time, etc.,” Scott says. “As a 51-year-old man myself, I have seen first-hand my body change from the skinny kid that could eat anything to the guy that still wants to eat anything but shouldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belly fat is not just frustrating to deal with—it’s also unhealthy. One of the biggest health risks of belly fat is &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/high-intensity-cardio-workouts-to-lose-visceral-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Visceral fat is fat that is stored deep in the abdominal area surrounding many organs including the liver, intestines, and pancreas,” Scott explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat can &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/04/22/too-much-belly-fat-even-for-people-with-a-healthy-bmi-raises-heart-risks" target="_blank"&gt;lead to heart disease&lt;/a&gt; (especially in men over 50), type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers (like colon and prostate), and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Best Workout To Fight Belly Fat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat belly fat, Scott recommends a three-day strength/two-day cardio routine—and the reason for combining the two kinds of exercise is simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we do cardio we burn fat then, and when we add a weight routine into the mix, we build muscle which burns fat long term. This is why we need both cardio and strength,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day 1: Cardio&lt;/b&gt; (30-60 minutes)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perform a longer, slow/steady-state cardio workout to assist your body in burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this cardio day, Scott recommends spending time on a rower or bike, as it’s simpler to speed up and then slow down. But you can also choose a treadmill, walk, or swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to carve out ample time to rest, which means no screen time or very limited amount of time on devices. Scott recommends the following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow nature walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Day 6, Scott suggests starting with bigger muscles and core last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reasoning behind why I do core last is in my routines I am consistently engaging my core, so I want my core fresh and ready for the workloads on the rest of the body … I start with the bigger muscles first. I do core last, while other trainers do core first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a matter of preference; test out what works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triceps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biceps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoulders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day 7: Rest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

Experts say melanoma at this stage are far more likely to spread to other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weeks later she underwent surgery to remove the growth, as well as healthy tissue beside her breasts and several glands under her armpit, to check for spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of melanoma cancer have increased from 2004-2006 to 2014-2016, according to the most recent figures available, to 26 cases per 100,000, compared to 17 cases per 100,000 in 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was not fully prepared for the extensive amount of time this surgery would take,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My surgery was an all-day process with prep, surgery, and recovery.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tactile nature of humans and our fondness for stroking and fondling our pets, when we live with animals, microbes from their fur and paws &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23599893/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to end up on our skin – at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This has led to suggestions that the "microbiome" could be colonised by bugs from our pets. This is the collection of vast colonies of microbes that live on our skin, in our mouths and most notably in the gut, which hosts a significant concentration of our body's immune cells. According to Nasia Safdar, an infectious disease professor at the University of Wisconsin in the US, this concept has attracted interest from the pet food industry. The idea would be to develop products marketed as promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in cats and dogs, which might then be transferred to their owners, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That angle has been an attractive one for people to fund, because for most of us, it's the human condition that we're interested in," says Safdar. "So what role can the animal play in that?" she asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Safdar says she is considering running a study which would involve collecting faecal samples from both pets and their human owners when they come for repeated veterinary appointments to see if their guts become more microbially similar with time. She also wants to see if she can identify similar bacterial species which could confer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, others feel that the idea of dog or cat or any other kind of non-human animal microbes being incorporated into our microbiomes is dubious. "There's zero evidence of that whatsoever," says Gilbert. "We don't really find long-term accumulation of dog bacteria on our skin, in our mouth, or in our guts. They don't really stick around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In response to this, Safdar says that she still feels the study is very much worthwhile, stating she feels it is plausible that gut microbes can be transferred from pets to their owners and vice versa. "It's worth studying and hasn't been closely looked at yet," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert believes that pets are playing a different, yet equally vital role. His theory is that because our distant ancestors domesticated various species, our immune systems have evolved to be stimulated by the microbes that they carry. These microbes do not reside with us permanently, but our immune cells recognise the familiar signals as they pass through, which then keeps the immune system developing in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Over many millennia, the human immune system got used to seeing dog, horse and cow bacteria," says Gilbert. "And so when it sees those things, it triggers beneficial immune development. It knows what to do," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058978/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Studies have also shown&lt;/a&gt; that humans who live in the same household as a pet end up with gut microbiomes which are more like each other, and Gilbert suggests that the animal is likely acting as a vehicle to help transfer human microbes between its owners. At the same time, regular exposure to the pet's own microbes will also be stimulating their immune systems to stay more active and better manage the bacterial populations in their own gut and skin microbiomes, keeping pathogens out and stimulating the growth of useful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Ancient microbes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is all good news for animal lovers, with research continuing to suggest that living with pets across our life course can be good for our immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After reading the study on the Amish and the Hutterites, Shanahan was inspired to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0963-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conduct his own research&lt;/a&gt; on Irish travellers, a marginalised population who typically live in confined spaces amongst multiple animals – from dogs and cats to ferrets and horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Shanahan sequenced their gut microbiomes and compared them with Irish people living more modern lifestyles today, as well as microbiomes sequenced from indigenous populations in Fiji, Madagascar, Mongolia, Peru and Tanzania who still live a lifestyle akin to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Researchers at the University of Arizona in the US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2015-03-friend-medicine.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have explored&lt;/a&gt; whether rehoming unwanted dogs with older adults could help to improve their physical and mental health by boosting their immune systems. And results from an Italian research group which created an educational farm where children from homes with no pets could regularly pet horses under supervision &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424002283" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the children's gut microbiomes started to produce more beneficial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert says it's plausible that this could be a means of improving childhood immunity. "If you're exposed to more types of bacteria, you are going to stimulate your immune system in more variable ways, which may then improve its ability to manage the microbes on your skin and in your gut," he says. "But you're not being colonised by animal bacteria, that's not happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers point out that having pets throughout your life can also facilitate more microbial interactions with your immune system in other ways. For example, having a dog makes you more likely to go for regular walks, notes Liam O'Mahoney, professor of immunology at APC Microbiome Ireland, a microbiome-dedicated research centre at University College Cork. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you have a pet, you get out and about in the environment and go for walks in the park," says O'Mahoney. "And by doing that, you're also being exposed to microbes from the park, the soil, everywhere which can all be useful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOekx3cjc0YjFQbFpfY2dJZnpNNlRVMVhqLUVUTkk2QjJvVG56TmlueEVET0NCTWI5ZVY5UVNHT0hfTk5Yb2Nfa0dCNlptUHdrM01vMVk1V3VmWjJRRy1yRUh4aEpRY1MtZ0swNU1sQnRJZVRmbHEzYldBYkwyNVZYRWh5WFJOejd3bFE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，抗炎饮食可以帮助结肠癌患者延长寿命- NBC新闻 | An anti-inflammatory diet may help colon cancer patients live longer, study says - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQZ3I0RGI3Z3J0ZHV0UE43WTFibHB2Vkc4VXpBNU9wWkl6NksweF9kdzd0SHVueVRjSkpYRzJJeFcybHNMaU96NW1tOWZSZ00xbW91aTg3WFZ5RmlNa3l1ZmNtWEQ3SU0wZnl2YXRXUWJjRjVoaFhlSVk0RUZXVlBMVy00NHFsc0R1Yk9ZM01QRDBvelpCTjVQUHZrcGNHaUxJMjhrVHlMM2ViaUpaQjExY2NxOTNaYWRObGN1QTBKNXM5UdIBVkFVX3lxTE1MeW5KS2pvOWRuVmoyRDdQQVZzV0IxVDVpVzd1cFJRX1Z6T2tUdDdhRndKUms0cUJnTnRXZGFkNkg4dkxEM2poOFFrZ0RlSnNWOWhzdW1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eating food that lowers&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/inflammation-how-protect-body-against-chronic-disease-rcna193856" target="_blank"&gt; inflammation in the body&lt;/a&gt; may help people with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/advanced-colon-cancer-patients-lived-twice-long-pfizer-combo-therapy-t-rcna209686" target="_blank"&gt;advanced colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; survive longer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to research presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, presented Sunday, suggest that cancer patients can have at least some control over the outcome of their disease, even at later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This is the most common question that patients ask me when I see them in clinic,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, an author of the new study and associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “What is it that I can do myself to try to improve my chances, help me live as long as possible?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s study — which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal — looked at the diets of 1,625 adults with stage 3 colon cancer, meaning the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With standard care — surgery and chemotherapy in most cases — about three-quarters of patients can expect to live at least five years after their diagnosis, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new research suggests diet may influence those odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s unique about colon cancer is that it’s a cancer of the digestive tract,” said Dr. Sara Char, Ng’s co-author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “What we eat will inevitably go through the colon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All the patients in the new analysis got the same treatment: surgery, followed by three to six months of chemotherapy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They also filled out dietary questionnaires during and after their chemotherapy treatments. Researchers followed up on the participants for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients who regularly ate foods that promote inflammation in the body — ultraprocessed foods, excessive amounts of sugar and saturated fats — had up to an 87% higher risk of dying from their disease when compared to people who ate a far less inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-eating-reach-70-no-chronic-disease-study-rcna197811" target="_blank"&gt;less-inflammatory diet was more plant-focused&lt;/a&gt;, and included foods such as leafy greens, carrots, coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fa1" class="body-heading"&gt;Real-world examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer centers have dietitians who work with patients to make sure they’re getting proper nutrition while they’re going through treatment, said Heather Greenlee, medical director of integrative medicine at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Chemotherapy, for example, can come with side effects, including difficulty swallowing and poor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once treatment is done, patients may need additional help making dietary changes to improve survival long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The issue that a lot of patients face is that people don’t know how to make these dietary changes that are sustainable over time,” said Greenlee, who also wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Greenlee heads Fred Hutch’s &lt;a href="https://www.cookforyourlife.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Cook for Your Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program for people who’ve had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really important for big studies like this to be done to show that there is this potential benefit for lifestyle and behavioral changes in the face of some of these cancers that are difficult to treat,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recommends a plant-focused approach, such as adding beans, broccoli and cauliflower to meals, as well as high-fiber foods. “Those are all good places to start,” Greenlee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c8be2f" class="body-heading"&gt;Exercise boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients also boosted their chances of living longer with physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who ate diets least likely to promote inflammation and who did the equivalent of taking a brisk walk for an hour at least three times a week had a 63% lower risk of death from any cause during the five-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/exercise-may-benefit-colon-cancer-patients-much-drugs-rcna209560" target="_blank"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt;, also presented Sunday at the cancer meeting, found that regular exercise was linked to a 28% lower risk of the cancer recurring, a new cancer diagnosis or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#" target="_blank"&gt;150,000 people are diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with colorectal cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Not only can healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise, have an impact after a cancer diagnosis,” said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, “they are absolutely as good as the benefits we see from drugs, and probably even better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQZ3I0RGI3Z3J0ZHV0UE43WTFibHB2Vkc4VXpBNU9wWkl6NksweF9kdzd0SHVueVRjSkpYRzJJeFcybHNMaU96NW1tOWZSZ00xbW91aTg3WFZ5RmlNa3l1ZmNtWEQ3SU0wZnl2YXRXUWJjRjVoaFhlSVk0RUZXVlBMVy00NHFsc0R1Yk9ZM01QRDBvelpCTjVQUHZrcGNHaUxJMjhrVHlMM2ViaUpaQjExY2NxOTNaYWRObGN1QTBKNXM5UdIBVkFVX3lxTE1MeW5KS2pvOWRuVmoyRDdQQVZzV0IxVDVpVzd1cFJRX1Z6T2tUdDdhRndKUms0cUJnTnRXZGFkNkg4dkxEM2poOFFrZ0RlSnNWOWhzdW1n</guid></item><item><title>6岁男孩患有危及生命的中风，导致瘫痪： “罕见并发症” -福克斯新闻 | Boy, 6, suffers life-threatening stroke that causes paralysis: 'Rare complication' - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQQktlaDlQdlJSVVowMFV6ZnBnRXNxOGdmdWdwWHcwakpjTlVaSVBFclU0ZzdwSFlLdmRDQjA5cnNya2QyRnZiX0NsNDRrOHZ2Q1prMEk4bGZvamhXUEJCRlVwUUlrMGdmVVR1UXFMRW4ydjctZUFBM085YlVGemVfRHVtTjF2VW96NExFSWpxWUh4Wm9MMzVDeUNRc04yRXFrU0Fn0gGoAUFVX3lxTFBUZlBpN19pN09adXU0akRHZkdfMVM5b2lVYk9XeVlXNUNRY3BDclc3ei1ROVVQZWJVZzNqVl9wOHFMbDFIS3l2dWhuTGZIUXFQNWsyczQyeWZGa2hXTlBWZUh6c0hPdVN5T1VOdmlETGt0YW80NmMtVEdZUmZ6TFJDWE80dUVRbjAzV3BGa1RwejFzNURkbTdUMi0ySks4cFFlUi1xTFJmYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;div class="contain" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;   &lt;div class="info" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;p data-v-5f342d4c&gt;Preston Patton was just 6 years old when he suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Christmas Eve is usually an evening of fun and festivity — but for one Illinois family in 2023, it came with a life-threatening medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;After enjoying a few &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;holiday traditions&lt;/a&gt;, the Patton family had just gotten settled at the dinner table when Preston Patton, who was 6 years old at the time, suddenly slid onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He just fell off the chair and was limp," recalled Shawn Patton, Preston’s father, according to a press release from OSF HealthCare. "I didn’t think it &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was a stroke&lt;/a&gt;, but I just knew something was wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/mini-strokes-may-cause-surprising-long-term-health-issue-experts-warn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patton immediately called 911 and first responders rushed his son to OSF HealthCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, a team of emergency and pediatric doctors assessed the situation. A brain scan revealed that Preston had a blood clot in his brain, and his &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart function&lt;/a&gt; had dropped to just 10%. &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of this article.) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shawn Patton is pictured with his young son, Preston, who experienced a life-threatening stroke at 6 years old.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF HealthCare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), this condition is rare in children, generally affecting only around one or two in every 100,000 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;kids and teens&lt;/a&gt;, statistics show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had complete paralysis on the left side of his body," said Sourabh Lahoti, M.D., a vascular and interventional neurologist with OSF HealthCare Illinois Neurological Institute, in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No movement was possible, and the vision in his left &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;visual field&lt;/a&gt; was lost. He could not move his eyes to the left, either," added Lahoti, who led the boy's care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had the telltale signs of a stroke affecting the right side of his brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scan showed that the clot was blocking blood flow to the right side of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Preston’s brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"No movement was possible, and the vision in his left visual field was lost."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had to take that clot out. If we hadn’t, chances are he would have gone on to develop a very big stroke," Lahoti said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would have not only left him paralyzed potentially for the rest of his life, but it could have been life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A brain scan revealed that Preston Patton, pictured front right, had a blood clot in his brain, and his heart function had dropped to just 10%.

"We decided to take that risk and prevent a lifelong disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preston Patton, pictured here with his sister, is one of the few children in the world to undergo a life-saving thrombectomy, according to OSF HealthCare.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF Healthcare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the clot was removed, the doctors saw a "complete reversal" of Patton’s symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was "truly magical," Dr. Lahoti recalled in the release, particularly after the boy had arrived at the hospital in a state of complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the anesthesia was taken off, he woke up and was able to move his left arm and leg again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/friends-family-may-protect-heart-attack-stroke-diabetes-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRIENDS, FAMILY MAY PROTECT AGAINST HEART ATTACK, STROKE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES, STUDY SUGGESTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before thrombectomy therapy became available, patients didn’t have other options, the doctor noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The usual course was they were left with paralysis for life, and they were never able to live normally again," said Lahoti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors now believe that Preston’s stroke was caused by a "rare complication" from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/cold-and-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;flu infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the flu, there was a cross-reaction of the immunity his body built up," Lahoti said. "His immune system attacked the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;flu virus&lt;/a&gt;, but also his kidneys and heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon after the clot was removed, the doctors saw a "complete reversal" of Patton’s symptoms.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF Healthcare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of that, his heart pumping got really weak, and we think that led to the formation of a clot in his heart. The clot then traveled from the heart to his brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston’s father noted that his late wife (mother of Preston and his sister, Carter), had died of a pulmonary embolism, which made the young boy’s medical emergency even more "emotionally challenging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks in the hospital, Preston is now doing well and is enjoying his favorite activities again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He goes to OT (occupational therapy) once a week and PT (physical therapy) once a month now," Shawn Patton said in an interview with OSF HealthCare.

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating your greens—and plenty of berries—could help sharpen your mind well into older age, new research shows. A large, long-term study found that even starting the so-called MIND diet later in life can significantly lower a person's risk of Alzheimer's and dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/mind-diet-mediterranean-dash-dementia-study-rcna209573"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports. Presented at the American Society for Nutrition's annual meeting, research led by University of Hawaii at Manoa and University of Southern California scientists found that middle-aged and older adults who followed the MIND diet—a combination of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, which aims to lower blood pressure—developed dementia at lower rates than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        Like the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet is rich in leafy greens, olive oil, and whole grains, but because of its focus on the brain, it gives special weight to foods like berries, which have been linked to brain health. Individual foods are scored based on type and frequency of consumption, with a higher overall score linked to a lower risk of dementia. For example, having two or more servings of berries per week scores higher than having one or none.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Researchers used data from the Multiethnic Cohort, which started in the early 1990s and followed adults from five racial/ethnic groups. At the start, participants who most closely adhered to the MIND diet had a 9% lower dementia risk, with an even greater reduction—13%—for Black, Latino, and white participants. Those who improved their MIND diet scores over a decade saw their risk drop by 25% compared to those who adhered less strictly to it over the years—even if they had not originally adhered to the diet closely, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mind-diet-brain-alzheimers-dementia-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; reports.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;center&gt;

                                        The MIND diet's recommendations include six or more servings of leafy greens a week, daily servings of other vegetables, and limited intake of red meat, cheese, fried foods, pastries, and sweets. Experts emphasize variety in vegetables and note that while the study shows an association, it does not prove causation. Still, the findings align with a body of evidence that Mediterranean-style diets benefit overall brain and heart health. MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, while DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

I don't get why people are so scared of it,' a TikToker commented on Jana's video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clip was also shared on X, formerly Twitter, where one person said: 'Oil does a lot more for both flavour and the cooking process than simply preventing things from sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I implore [someone] to do this with a pork chop or mushrooms and let me know how it tastes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really wish people would understand that some dose of oil is perfectly fine and healthy,' a third added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the influencer made it clear that she has nothing against oil and was simply sharing what she had learned. 'I love oil. But it's a fun hack. Don't worry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In reply to a comment about there being fewer calories with her hack, Jana also clarified that she still uses oil to cook and was not interested in maintaining a calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was actually just a hack I wanted to try. I am still using oil, because it's healthy and we need it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using plant-based oils - such as olive, avocado, sunflower, canola, corn, and grapeseed - has been linked to better health outcomes, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 30-year study of more than 200,000 adults conducted by researchers at Harvard University found that people who cook with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473497/harvard-study-discovery-health-impact-seed-oils-rfk-jr.html"&gt;these types of oils instead of butter were less likely to die of any cause&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were 'surprised' to find swapping less than a tablespoon of butter for the same amount of oil lowered the overall risk of death by 17 percent, which the team called 'a pretty huge effect on health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested this could be because seed oils are lower than butter in saturated fat, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unlikely there would be any health benefit to using a cucumber instead of oil to cook, the mild-flavoured vegetable became a surprising favourite among TikTok users thanks to recipes shared by Canadian content creator Logan Moffitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Logan's &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13766579/cucumber-guy-bland-vegetable-viral-bizarre-recipes.html"&gt;recipes for sliced cucumbers went completely viral&lt;/a&gt; last year, sharing combinations such as soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, sugar and MSG, and salmon, cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 06:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ0gG0AUFVX3lxTFAzV3k3UEpoOTQya2ZpRTNCbVo1dm5uMlpZS1F6WnZ5aUxHM0VpYUJtUTFCX2t5eG84bzgwNS01ZzlUSFFpdXlIRzhoaG0yX3FYejRXZGQxaktoQVR2Ulc1ZVVXWTVUbGMweVVvb1FaX1JRMTA3RlRlS2tZTG5UMHBfOVFQUUczNG1tc3dzSG53OFpINlJhRVJ3Qm9MaG5hckhvZ2FHXzdZWFZQYmREdzlYblV0dQ</guid></item><item><title>女人对她“从意大利祖母那里学到的”奇怪的煎蛋方法感到愤怒-每日邮报 | Woman causes outrage over bizarre method for frying an egg which she 'learnt from an Italian grandmother' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman has sparked controversy after revealing she uses cucumber water to fry an egg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-072fc440-3fca-11f0-8acf-5fc668d44351"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; user who goes by the handle @jana.dvll on the video-sharing platform recently posted a video in which she uses a cucumber instead of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Germany-based influencer claimed in her video caption that she learned about the oil alternative from an unnamed 'Italian grandmother'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her video, which has been viewed over 16.8 million times on TikTok, Jana rubs the cut end of a whole cucumber directly on the bottom of her frying pan on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then cracks an egg straight into the pan.

I am still using oil, because it's healthy and we need it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using plant-based oils - such as olive, avocado, sunflower, canola, corn, and grapeseed - has been linked to better health outcomes, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 30-year study of more than 200,000 adults conducted by researchers at Harvard University found that people who cook with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473497/harvard-study-discovery-health-impact-seed-oils-rfk-jr.html"&gt;these types of oils instead of butter were less likely to die of any cause&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were 'surprised' to find swapping less than a tablespoon of butter for the same amount of oil lowered the overall risk of death by 17 percent, which the team called 'a pretty huge effect on health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested this could be because seed oils are lower than butter in saturated fat, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unlikely there would be any health benefit to using a cucumber instead of oil to cook, the mild-flavoured vegetable became a surprising favourite among TikTok users thanks to recipes shared by Canadian content creator Logan Moffitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Logan's &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13766579/cucumber-guy-bland-vegetable-viral-bizarre-recipes.html"&gt;recipes for sliced cucumbers went completely viral&lt;/a&gt; last year, sharing combinations such as soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, sugar and MSG, and salmon, cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 06:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ</guid></item></channel></rss>
