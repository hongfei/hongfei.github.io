&lt;p&gt;Lately, more and more people are becoming aware that 10,000 steps is no longer the gold standard — it was actually a very successful and slightly misleading marketing campaign that gathered a lot of momentum fast and had people checking the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; regularly during walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some research has suggested that 7,000 steps is enough to keep you happy and healthy, a meta-analysis from 2022 published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; found you can still achieve health benefits for less, and age could determine how many steps per day you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the study?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty/stevecoleimages)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis assessed 15 studies — seven published and eight unpublished — and found that more steps were associated with lower mortality risk; the results plateaued at between 6,000-8,000 for adults aged 60 and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For younger adults aged below 60, results plateaued at 8,000 to 10,000. In this study, researchers found “inconsistent evidence” that step intensity was associated with mortality beyond step volume. This suggests a “curvilinear association and range” in daily steps and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, another study published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt; found that your cadence can matter — a pace of 100 steps per minute could be classified as moderate-intensity exercise and boost your cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while we can clearly see there’s a range you should aim for, according to your age, is there a minimum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis suggests there is: 2337 for cardiovascular mortality and 3867 for all-cause mortality. The study, published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, assessed over 226,000 participants to determine the minimum figure we should be aiming to reach each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, anything fewer than roughly 2,300 per day could increase your risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart disease. And as your step count increases, your risk could decrease over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-should-you-increase-your-step-count"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should you increase your step count?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find you’re short on time,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength"&gt; walking workouts&lt;/a&gt; can help you reach the minimum number of steps. It’s also worth learning about a process called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for “Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis,” and basically accounts for all activity and energy expenditure you can achieve outside of eating, sleeping and dedicated workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of playing with your kids, carrying groceries, or using one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks"&gt;best standing desks&lt;/a&gt; during your workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened"&gt;increasing your step count&lt;/a&gt; could lead to better health. A 1,000-step increment decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 15%, while a 500-step increment decreased the cardiovascular risk of mortality by 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, the universal exercise guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, particularly in nature, has been associated with boosted mood and creativity, reduced anxiety and fewer feelings of depression. And as we know, walking counts toward aerobic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;color walking&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner"&gt; intuitive walking&lt;/a&gt; can also boost your step count without feeling like a workout, so I recommend giving these a try if you’re short on steps for your age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your daily step count doesn’t need to be achieved all in one go, so if you consider a 5k walk might take you over one hour (and roughly 6,000-7,500 steps), then you could break this up into manageable chunks during your day.

published Monday in Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcdad9" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all occurred at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c73c0" class="body-graf"&gt;The cases included exposures to nicotine pouches, chewing tobacco, regular cigarettes, vapes and nicotine replacement products like gum and lozenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e8a3f" class="body-graf"&gt;But it’s nicotine pouches, like the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/zyn-nicotine-pouches-tobacco-free-health-harm-rcna157214" target="_blank"&gt; wildly popular Zyn&lt;/a&gt;, that are behind the most significant rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06454a" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research found that the rate of poisonings involving nicotine pouches among kids under 6 rose from 0.48 per 100,000 children in 2020 to 4.14 per 100,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a0f75" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s an increase of 763% in just three years — a startling finding that correlates with a surge in sales of nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03682" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine pouches — which users tuck between their lip and gum and later discard — can contain as much as 6 milligrams of nicotine, a stimulant, and have been promoted as tobacco-free, spit-free and hands-free alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e1abe" class="body-graf"&gt;They are not, however, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as nicotine replacement products used to help quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d195d" class="body-graf"&gt;A&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782874" target="_blank"&gt; 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health (one of several&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cut-quit-smoking-programs-tips-cdc-fda-rcna199251" target="_blank"&gt; public health groups dismantled under the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;) found that sales of nicotine pouches rose dramatically in the past decade, from $709,000 in 2016 to $216 million by mid-2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7d634" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was just a matter of time before they fell into the hands of younger kids,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “It’s unfortunate, but not shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7c79a4" class="body-heading"&gt;Why is nicotine toxic to little kids?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3c2f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine is a chemical that’s highly toxic and could easily exceed a fatal dose in small children, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-013-1127-0" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ea4d" class="body-graf"&gt;The chemical increases heart rate and blood pressure, and could lead to nausea, vomiting or even coma, the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1d54f" class="body-graf"&gt;Most cases included in the new research weren’t serious enough to warrant medical attention. But 39 children had significant side effects, like trouble breathing and seizures, said Natalie Rine, an author of the new study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51604c" class="body-graf"&gt;Most nicotine poisoning cases, 76%, were babies and toddlers under age 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff8ee3" class="body-graf"&gt;Two children, a 1-year-old boy and another boy about a year and a half old, died after ingesting liquid nicotine used in vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f2baa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s good that the majority of kids in the study actually did pretty well. Most kids had either minor symptoms or no symptoms and didn’t require any medical management,” Rine said. “But two deaths is a lot, especially for something considered a preventable death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f607f3" class="body-heading"&gt;How to reduce nicotine poisonings in kids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6943e" class="body-graf"&gt;Kids are curious by nature. Babies and toddlers in particular explore their worlds by putting things in their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef21ba" class="body-graf"&gt;And they’re masters at breaking into drawers and cabinets to find new “toys.” Canisters of nicotine pouches are not equipped with child-resistant packaging. They taste good, too. Mint and fruit flavors are almost always added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39b78" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Shea said it’s critical that all nicotine products are placed far out of reach of children. “That doesn’t mean in your purse, in your back pocket or on the counter,” she said. “It means locked away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0baa0" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not just parents and other adult caregivers who must be mindful of their nicotine products. An &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833331" target="_blank"&gt;April study&lt;/a&gt; from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found the use of nicotine pouches among high school students nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33dc2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s easy for a teenager to be using this product and have parents be unaware,” O’Shea said. “It’s important for parents to be talking with their teenagers about products like this and having open dialogue in a nonjudgmental way in order to ascertain any risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7440e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Rine also recommends adding the national poison control number to cellphones: 1-800-222-1222.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 04:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVmV5Q0I4dGV6dmJiOVRZM1Nmd0RDRHE1c0pJaTdUZm84OGFPN2dwdER3MWRxNk1ac2NJY0IxVkhCUnY5NHJjQW00V0lmbVFjNDM0blhoUFpXYXVxMVZGTkxCN19FUkd5TmFhSUJRaGVQTVQzQUFRQk5OY21qQTl2MkdwbE1HLVVCRGFZNGZnMjdEZEhZWUlzR2hfNUEtSWRBeUhPYVhFVmJaTnJy0gFWQVVfeXFMTVVfQWI4eGxrT1N0Z0w1ZmdRZDc1WDFJRGZldXJwTDloRGszRWl1ay0tZklyTlNFVUhTaENia3R1MExzX0VRZVFpWEVwYjY5ejN6UDZvaGc</guid></item><item><title>梅毒感染急剧上升，女性感染人数最多- standardmedia.co.ke | Syphilis infections rise sharply with women most hit - standardmedia.co.ke</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tbl_art"&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Kenya is reporting a surge in syphilis, while Baringo County leads in Hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616524592174-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Approximately 1.8 per cent of the population tests positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;This is according to a new report by the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (NASCOP) and UNaids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Despite the high number of infections, only a small proportion of those who test positive for syphilis seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The report, titled ‘‘Triple Elimination: Private Health Sector and Professional Association’’, reveals that the infections were recorded in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616513706683-4" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, 16 per cent of those infected with syphilis were women, yet &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/counties/article/2001478429/governments-asked-to-adopt-new-guidance-of-testing-stis"&gt;only nine per cent of them received treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Most of the women who tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease were identified during Antenatal Clinics (ANC), alongside HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, for instance, the country registered a total of 1,766,099 pregnancies, among the 1,468,615 enrolled for ANC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least eight million people were infected in 2022, including 700,000 infants who acquired the infection from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;A NASCOP official, Frankline Sangok, said that although the number of syphilis infections is high, screening is not done optimally due to a lack of test kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We have a problem with screening for syphilis because of a lack of kits for testing,” said Sangok during the release of preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Top counties in syphilis testing include Laikipia, Nyeri, Nakuru, Makueni, Uasin Gishu, Nyamira, Machakos, Kirinyaga, Kakamega, Homa Bay, and Kajiado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Others are Murang’a, Mombasa, Nyandarua, Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisii, Busia, and Bomet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The disease presents a painless sore at the site of infection, while secondary syphilis may include a non-itchy rash—often on the palms and soles along with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, if a pregnant woman who is infected does not receive early and effective treatment, she can transmit the infection to her unborn infant, commonly known as congenital syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Among interventions for optimal testing and treatment of the disease, according to NASCOP and UNAids, are addressing vulnerabilities and inequalities that sustain new infections and impede progress, tackling health barriers to quality services, ensuring supply chain sustainability, and building social capital and community intelligence to diagnose and treat syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Amid dwindling donor support, the ministry is banking on leadership and alignment of resources with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The report was released during a public-private partnership engagement meant to onboard all stakeholders in the elimination of syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Private hospitals are expected to help mobilise resources and share accurate data with the ministry for proper planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;LVCT Health representative, Patrick Oyaro, said there is a need to document data to support planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Data is key. There is no way you will plan appropriately without data. This shall help in procurement of commodities and treatment,” said Dr Oyaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Meanwhile, three per cent of the Kenyan population has Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Baringo County is leading in Hepatitis B cases at 12 per cent, followed by Migori and Turkana counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Head of Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) at NASCOP, Nazila Ganatra, said stigma greatly affects the eradication of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Lack of awareness and stigma are among the challenges derailing the elimination of Hepatitis,” Dr Ganatra said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Hepatitis is the &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001258135/donated-blood-has-hiv-syphilis-report-shows"&gt;inflammation of the liver&lt;/a&gt; and may present with pain or bloating of the belly, dark urine, fatigue, and general body weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Other symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;If left untreated, it can damage vital organs including the kidneys and lungs, and beyond that, can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the expert, adherence to treatment can suppress the virus and prevent underlying health complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Patients widely use tenofovir and lamivudine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least 304 million people are living with hepatitis — 254 million of them afflicted by Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C affecting another 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Data from NASCOP shows that in Kenya, about 1.9 million people are infected with Hepatitis B and C viruses, with the majority (1.56 million) having Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;An additional report by the Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 estimates Hepatitis B prevalence at three per cent among the general population, and 4.7 per cent among people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Ganatra noted that research is ongoing to establish the causes of increased cases in these regions, but said stigma significantly limits access to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Ministry of Health, through NASCOP, has set up a unit to scale up awareness, screening, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We want to create more awareness of the disease in the population because it is &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001494541/study-uncovers-overlooked-sexual-health-crisis-among-adults-over-50"&gt;treatable and preventable&lt;/a&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Further, the ministry is working towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“One of the agendas of elimination is ensuring that a mother attending ANC is tested for HIV, syphilis, and Hepatitis, for a comprehensive approach to disease reduction,” added Ganatra. &lt;/p&gt;
                                                            &lt;/div&gt;

Having &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; means living with a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to a continuous decline in memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Sadly, as the disease progresses, even basic activities and communication become challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors influence the risk of developing dementia, with some being completely beyond your control. Aging is the most significant risk factor, as individuals over the age of 65 are more susceptible. Genetics also play a crucial role, with specific genetic mutations directly linked to Alzheimer’s disease. However, along with unchangeable factors, certain lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of cognitive decline, with diet being a pivotal piece of the puzzle. “Some of the best foods for brain health are antioxidant-rich wild blueberries, salad greens for B vitamins, salmon for its anti-inflammatory fatty acids, fiber-rich black beans, and walnuts, the best source of plant-based omega-3 ALA among nuts,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie Moon, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There are some foods you should avoid when focusing on brain health support too, with candy being the #1 food on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Limit Candy for Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking steps to reduce dementia risk is one positive step for brain health. While there isn’t one food that will cause dementia, high-added-sugar candy tops the list of foods that should be limited on a brain-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Candies are not your brain’s friend,” Moon says. She points to a study that found that eating too much added sugar more than doubled the risk for dementia. “That includes added sugar from candies, as well as other sweets like pastries, sweetened café drinks and sodas,” she says. Researchers think that high blood sugar and insulin levels are risk factors for Alzheimer’s because insulin resistance may also occur in the brain, which may impact memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everything can be eaten in moderation in a healthy, balanced eating plan. “While fine once in a while, research has found that a diet that is consistently high in added sugar may increase the amyloid plaque buildup in the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "These plaques disrupt the communication system in our brain, and scientists have found that people with Alzheimer’s disease tend to have more of these plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, says Ali, one study found that every 10 grams of added sugar consumed per day (equivalent to 2½ teaspoons of sugar or 8 gummy candies) was associated with a 1.3% to 1.4% increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Those with the highest daily added sugar intake had 19% higher odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Reduce Your Risk of Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting sweetened candy doesn't guarantee that you won't get dementia, but it is a positive step forward. Along with limiting added sugar in your diet, here are some other ways to reduce your dementia risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise by participating in both aerobic activity and resistance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you smoke cigarettes, take the first steps to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol intake. If you regularly drink alcohol, try to do so in moderation. Excessive drinking is linked to cognitive decline. Moderate drinking means two drinks or less in a day for men and one drink or less in a day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay socially engaged. Maintaining social connections builds your cognitive reserve to maintain good brain function with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, make sure you’re managing these well. Stiffness in arteries and blood vessels can damage the brain. If you need help or individualized advice, reach out to a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include brain-healthy foods in your diet. The MIND diet emphasizes foods like whole grains, nuts, berries, vegetables and olive oil, which research shows may help support brain health. “The brain-healthy MIND diet limits foods high in saturated fats and added sugars because both are linked to oxidative stress, inflammation and the brain plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” says Moon. She clarifies that this diet limits—but does not eliminate—fried foods, pastries and sweets, red meat, whole-fat cheese and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing will guarantee that you will live a life free from dementia. But certain steps may help reduce your risk, with your dietary choices being one factor. And along with eating brain-healthy foods, limiting your candy intake can help keep you cognitively sharp. Enjoying a small handful of candy corn on Halloween or conversation hearts on Valentine’s Day won’t “cause” dementia. “It’s important to remember that no single food eaten once, or even once in a while, is going to make or break your brain health,” Moon adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11769343" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1ydEZtRm53RV9NRUpXQ1VVc0MzY21JdGNKSXVyR3RmTkNBYVMxTTdDRnl4d0xuWGFqOU1FM3A3S1VaV2ZjVU1tVnQtVkVMNF9IM1AtcGxqUTlYNGlLVVgyalpSTDEzRWNXQXJB</guid></item><item><title>对家长减少儿童食物过敏的一条建议- ScienceAlert | One Piece of Advice to Parents Slashed Food Allergies in Children - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxObXFJanNFZFVENWhVQWlNVExEX1Z1dDMyZVduWmxVYVRXdmhJdEdva2NtNVNRMmV0TXlDeXRRMWRBaHZfNmtzVHRqSE9Od1dfd0g0M0l6ei1zMGFjZm5LbWZXdkhfTGxVRzhOQ21XRGlKU2J2RG9wNHdmN2hZZ2pNU1IzT2ZuQm9pSUlRZDU5X3c5cDlEVkVnRGJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New research highlights a crucial time window very early on in life, during which the introduction of eggs and peanut butter into the diets of babies significantly reduces the chances of them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-and-dangerous-allergens-doesn-t-appear-on-food-labels-in-the-us"&gt;becoming allergic&lt;/a&gt; to these foods later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings run counter to previous advice given to parents to avoid giving these foods to their kids until they're at least a year old over concerns that they might trigger allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers led by a team from the University of Western Australia compared the experiences of two groups of children in Australia: 506 whose parents got no specific feeding advice, and 566 whose parents were advised to start adding eggs and peanut butter to the diets of the infants at around six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skin-injuries-and-food-allergies-may-have-a-mysterious-connection?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Skin Injuries And Food Allergies May Have a Mysterious Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the babies in group two – whose caregivers followed the updated guidelines and introduced peanut butter and egg around six months of age – egg allergy reduced from 12 percent to 3 percent, and peanut allergy reduced from around 6 percent to 1 percent," &lt;a href="https://www.thekids.org.au/news--events/news-and-events-nav/2025/july/peanuts-and-eggs-reduces-allergy-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Summer Walker, a health scientist at the University of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, earlier introduction of these foods at the six-month mark made a notable difference to the number of kids who went on to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immunotherapy-may-reduce-the-severity-of-peanut-allergy-reactions-says-new-study"&gt;develop allergies&lt;/a&gt; by 12 months of age. Cow's milk was also included, though here the difference was smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice itself &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/introducing-peanuts-and-eggs-early-in-life-might-lead-to-less-allergies"&gt;isn't new&lt;/a&gt;, and the six-month milestone has in fact now been added to the official Infant Feeding and Allergy Prevention Guidelines proposed by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). Testing the guidelines in real population groups confirms the recommendations are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167163" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph.jpg" alt="Allergy risk chart" class="wp-image-167163 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph-600x200.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167163" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked allergic reactions in babies up to 12 months old.

All the babies involved in the research had a close relative with an allergy to one of these foods, and allergies &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergies-101/who-gets-allergies/"&gt;often run in families&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some parents are still confused about when to introduce allergens – especially those families with a history of allergies," &lt;a href="https://www.thekids.org.au/news--events/news-and-events-nav/2025/july/peanuts-and-eggs-reduces-allergy-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; research dietitian Debbie Palmer, from the University of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(25)00592-6/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(AP)  — &lt;/span&gt;A resident of northern Arizona has died from pneumonic plague, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare to humans, with on average about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death in Coconino County, which includes Flagstaff, was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said.

Today, it's easily treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague is the most common form of the bacterial infection, which spreads naturally among rodents like prairie dogs and rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague that spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague that infects the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas that can spread it between rodents, pets and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also get plague through touching infected bodily fluids. Health experts recommend taking extra care when handling dead or sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases happen in rural areas of northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KUTV</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 21:52:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa0tCSWNSMzBmT292M3lZbmdvTENCQ052bDNsMUdSYlBXTzdvZUFBUm9jandGQk1KWnRZZml4anY0Mmpzb0ZkR3RTQmxkY0dxcUpINVg5T1RSTnVSM3d4MXZ0bnIwN0VvejhobzRvdEZHYXRINWZaVjZ6RWlNSTZwOXpHZEZKYlRweTZFRUo1V0U</guid></item><item><title>常见的基因突变大大增加了男性患痴呆症的风险- Earth.com | Common genetic mutation dramatically increases the risk of dementia in men - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPeVhJQ2xhMkw1QmxsREFBcUpLSkgwY2NJQ2pleXFZYjR0S21nTFlmZEFOX0NTNHZiUDhJcS1iRDZRdlV0UHRGa1lGS1NFamtKX2JpRlozY1JHRjlFbEpoT1JIaDBVeHRlb2FNaDZKWjVSN09zRFlYQ1FrZG5GLVpTNzU5OTYtVkVtbUdSMTlaNm4tSnlMWmgydXRrTnNEbWFKaDBCTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one man in 36 carries two copies of a tiny change in the HFE gene and that detail can more than double his odds of developing dementia, according to a new analysis of nearly 12,200 Australians and Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia already affects about 433,000 Australians, and while women still outnumber men, this fresh genetic signal shows that older males with the variant face a steeper climb toward memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hfe-gene-men-and-dementia"&gt;HFE gene, men, and dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The haemochromatosis gene keeps the body’s iron traffic moving smoothly, yet its &lt;a href="https://www.haemochromatosis.org.uk/h63d-carrier-also-known-as-h63d-heterozygous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;H63D version&lt;/a&gt; is anything but rare, turning up in one in three people as a single copy and in roughly one in 36 as a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H63D does not usually overload the liver the way the better‑known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC165699/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C282Y variant&lt;/a&gt; can, but laboratory work shows that mutant HFE can upset cellular iron sensors and let free iron trigger damaging chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-iron-brains-and-memory"&gt;Genes, iron, brains and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is vital but volatile, and when it piles up inside microglia, the brain’s immune cells, it sparks oxidative stress and inflammation tied to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of animal and human data echo the theme: iron dyshomeostasis fans reactive oxygen species, injures neurons, and may even set off ferroptosis, a specialized form of cell death linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE variants have also been linked to Parkinson’s disease and motor neuron disorders, suggesting that iron mismanagement may be a shared pathway across multiple brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8661115/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that abnormal iron levels in regions like the substantia nigra and motor cortex are associated with earlier onset and faster progression of these diseases in genetically susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-aspree-data-revealed"&gt;What the ASPREE data revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspree.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The ASPREE trial&lt;/a&gt; followed 19,114 healthy seniors for a median 6.4 years to test low‑dose aspirin, generating a gold‑mine of aging data in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome scans within ASPREE showed that men with two H63D copies logged an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.39 for incident &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while women with the same genotype saw no extra risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,” &lt;a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/john-olynyk-6669ecca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor John Olynyk&lt;/a&gt;, of Curtin University Medical School, who co‑led the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-only-men"&gt;Why only men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/girls-diets-strongly-influence-when-they-begin-puberty/"&gt;Menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, pregnancy, and lower mid‑life ferritin give women a natural outlet for iron, which may blunt the variant’s impact; haemochromatosis complications likewise appear later and milder in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑imaging studies find that women who stop menstrual bleeding early accumulate more iron in deep brain regions, hinting that lifelong iron exposure could be the pivot that tips male brains toward damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex hormones complicate matters too, because &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; modulates iron metabolism and offers anti‑inflammatory benefits that may shield neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE analysis is already part of routine work‑ups when doctors suspect iron overload, but the new results suggest that broader screening in aging men could flag a hidden &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; risk before symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying carriers is inexpensive, and unlike many predictive markers, this one points to an actionable pathway, iron handling and its downstream inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-steps-today"&gt;Practical steps today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found no clear link between blood ferritin levels and dementia, yet keeping iron in the normal range, treating chronic inflammation, staying active, and eating a plant‑biased diet all intersect with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity alone can slash dementia risk by roughly 30 percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also emphasize blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and social engagement, interventions that help every older adult, variant carrier or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; prevention efforts often rely on broad lifestyle advice or age thresholds, but this variant suggests a need for sex‑aware screening policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If men with double H63D copies truly carry double the risk, early genetic testing could steer them toward more aggressive prevention long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-dementia-and-the-future"&gt;Men, dementia, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/paul-lacaze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Paul Lacaze&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt;, hopes that untangling how H63D alters brain pathways will spark medicines that block the harm even when the gene cannot be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will track variant carriers with MRI iron mapping and fluid biomarkers to catch early inflammatory changes, then test whether diet, phlebotomy, or anti‑ferroptotic drugs can tilt the balance back toward healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics rarely hands scientists such a common, sex‑specific clue, and this one arrives in time for a generation of men now crossing the 70‑year threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

With no traditional risk factors and a dentist who initially dismissed her concerns, the news came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, she underwent a glossectomy – removing part of her tongue and reconstructing it using tissue from her thigh – followed by a neck dissection to address spreading cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Powell began what she describes as the &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7516616874776382762" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“most morbid” experience of her life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“most morbid” experience of her life&lt;/a&gt;: 30 sessions of head and neck radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as a survivor, the 41-year-old mother of two reflects on the complex aftermath of living with a changed voice, altered taste, and the quiet resilience required to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I first realized something was wrong when I thought I had bit my tongue in my sleep because I woke up with a bump,” Powell tells PEOPLE exclusively. “I wasn’t too worried at first, I just thought it was strange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the unusual discovery, she asked her dentist about the bump, but he told her not to worry. Weeks passed, and the bump remained, despite the tongue’s tendency to heal quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing more concerned, Powell finally went to urgent care in January 2020 and was referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor (ENT) a month later. After inspecting the raised, square patch on her tongue, the doctor decided to take an immediate biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A week goes by without hearing anything and then one day, someone just calls you and says, ‘You have cancer,’” Powell recalls. “It’s like I didn’t even know who I was after that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; The bump on Jamie Powell's tongue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until that point, she had gone four months without a diagnosis, dismissed by providers because she didn’t fit the typical risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my tumor grew in those months,” she says. “It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, on March 23, 2020, Powell underwent a glossectomy, which required a week-long hospital stay, right at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. She also had a neck dissection to remove all the lymph nodes on her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell after surgery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,” Powell explains. “I then had to do 30 rounds of radiation to my head and neck, and that was absolute hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During radiation, a mesh mask was molded to her face and bolted to the table to keep her completely still throughout each session. “Day after day, you endure the burning, get blisters all over your mouth and food and water taste like sewage,” she reveals. “It’s awful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healing from surgery was a slow process. She had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words, all while her tongue felt like a foreign object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healing process is so frustrating; to this day, I have lifelong side effects I deal with every day,” Powell reveals. “I don’t taste food, I can only eat soft foods, and my voice is different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell holding the mesh mask used during radiation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication was a daily challenge, especially with her children, who often couldn’t understand her. The loss of clear speech left her feeling angry and heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,” she recalls. “I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, Powell’s voice remains muffled, and certain sounds are harder to say, along with several other lingering side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Radiation to the head and neck was so brutal. It left me with limited mobility in opening and closing my mouth,” she explains. “During the night, my jaw tightens and every morning I have to physically pry my mouth open and stretch it out to get movement. It’s become my 4 a.m. morning routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her taste buds burned off, everything besides coffee and peanut butter tastes like “wet cardboard” to Powell. “For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,” she reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell also has no salivary glands, leading to a consistently dry mouth. She has to take sips of water after every bite – an adjustment that she’s slowly gotten used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell, her husband and two sons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just don’t ask me to go to dinner because I have to make the choice of either eating or talking. I can’t do both,” she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years since her diagnosis and surgery, Powell is determined to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7052732350035299630" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share her experience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;share her experience&lt;/a&gt; with cancer through social media, as well as her podcast, &lt;em&gt;Young Tongues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t find many people like me, my age, that had gone through this before. I remember feeling alone going through this and not wanting anyone to feel this way, so I videoed it all,” she explains. “I journaled and I talked about the raw honesty of not feeling like &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Cancer had stolen my identity and I had no idea who I was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing her symptoms and lessons from recovery felt therapeutic, but also purposeful. “That’s the thing, cancer devours your mental health along with your physical,” she says. “I wanted others to know it was okay to feel this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By spreading her story, Powell also hoped to raise awareness that cancer doesn’t always follow the rules – it can affect anyone, even younger people with no risk factors. Speaking out became both healing and a way to help others recognize symptoms that are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,” she explains. “I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone. The more we talk about this cancer, the more help we can be to one another.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/cancer-survivor-reflects-on-life-five-years-after-tongue-surgery-11768664" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:37:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQWG4tOUt4Ny1LdHZNRFFGMWZabE1Vd29uZVpFWFpvbW4tMjZ3c2sxck9lbkxUSlczdnJPXzlHRVREQUJOWEdFdmVIUmlsSDExVlFmRElmSzgzcV9VaWdRY2dpZUhmMnRub3RXcjRSdXlfN19kblJ4dHd1bXhuV0Zmd1NYN20</guid></item><item><title>每周注射可能彻底改变帕金森氏症的治疗-神经科学新闻 | Weekly Injection Could Revolutionize Parkinson’s Treatment - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5DNFB4UzV4eUdHb2tFWEk4Q0dvek8yVUI5bHBxVGVEY1JJS0k0OS1tNzM4QUd6aXNrMllrQ0dYX1kzT1BRLUVKVWYxbm5mVGpTQXRZYmNHWWFISHRsU0NXT3BzeThFbXpNbHdKUnZER3dOa1ZT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a long-acting weekly injection that delivers steady doses of levodopa and carbidopa, potentially transforming care for Parkinson’s disease.

This weekly injection could be a game-changer for Parkinson’s care,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson’s, but its short life span means it must be taken several times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA PhD student Deepa Nakmode says the in-situ implant is designed to release both levodopa and carbidopa steadily over one week, maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing the risks associated with fluctuating drug concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After years of focused research, it’s incredibly rewarding to see our innovation in long-acting injectables for Parkinson’s disease reach this stage. Our invention has now been filed for an Australian patent,” Nakmode says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injectable gel combines an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer PLGA with Eudragit L-100, a pH-sensitive polymer, to achieve a controlled and sustained drug release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive lab tests confirmed the system’s effectiveness and safety:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 90% of the levodopa dose and more than 81% of the carbidopa dose was released over seven days.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The implant degraded by over 80% within a week and showed no significant toxicity in cell viability tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formulation can be easily administered through a fine 22-gauge needle, minimising discomfort and eliminating the need for surgical implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of this research are profound,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By reducing the frequency of dosing from multiple times a day to a weekly injection is a major step forward in Parkinson’s therapy. We’re not just improving how the drug is delivered; we’re improving patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Garg says the technology could also be adapted for other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, pain management, and chronic infections that require long-term drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can be tuned to release drugs over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks depending on therapeutic needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA scientists hope to start clinical trials in the near future and are exploring commercialisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83e0e2ede7faade4eae1f0ecedc3f6edeaf0e2ade6e7f6ade2f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Candy Gibson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Candy Gibson – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13346-025-01892-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sanjay Garg et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-acting injectables have gained attraction as a system for treating chronic conditions due to their increased efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. Currently, patients with Parkinsons need to administer oral medications multiple times a day which imposes the significant risk of non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to design an in-situ implant-forming system for controlled delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for up to 1 week which will reduce the need for multiple dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA &lt;sub&gt;50:50&lt;/sub&gt;) and Eudragit L-100 was used to prepare the implants and the formulation was optimized to achieve a controlled release over 7 days. The optimized formulation containing 26% PLGA and 6% Eudragit L 100 displayed a favorable release profile and injectability with low viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimized formulation in vitro release study revealed an initial burst of 34.17% and 37.16% for levodopa and carbidopa in the first 24 h and about 92% and 81% release within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good correlation was observed between the in-vitro drug release data and ex-vivo drug release with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 for levodopa and 0.90 for carbidopa. Viscosity analysis showed the Newtonian behavior of the formulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringeability analysis of the formulation showed that the maximum force required for expelling the formulation was 32.98 ± 0.72 N using a 22 G needle. The in-vitro degradation studies revealed 81.89% weight loss of implant in 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prepared formulation was assessed for in-vivo performance using a convolution modeling technique using a convolve function in R software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predicted AUC 0-∞ h for the in-situ forming implant was 26505.5 ng/ml with Cmax, 399.3 ng/ml, and Tmax 24 h assuming 100% bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results justify that the prepared in-situ implant forming system can be a promising system for the delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:10:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5DNFB4UzV4eUdHb2tFWEk4Q0dvek8yVUI5bHBxVGVEY1JJS0k0OS1tNzM4QUd6aXNrMllrQ0dYX1kzT1BRLUVKVWYxbm5mVGpTQXRZYmNHWWFISHRsU0NXT3BzeThFbXpNbHdKUnZER3dOa1ZT</guid></item><item><title>医生说，每天两种水果可以促进肠道健康，对抗癌症风险- AOL.com | Two of these fruits a day can boost gut health, fight cancer risk, doctor says - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE81eHV1Y29sMkg4M0JzUENlNkZEbEUzdmo4WHBsM2pTUndoTTdVZjVSWG9vcUpxR1pETURBNHpMRThuYUktbk9UNFU2cThoMnhBRjFHdnpvMFQ4MFFEMWxxd21ZQWhIRGx1QXVZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating two of a specific type of fruit each day may keep the gastroenterologist away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Trisha Pasricha, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, "prescribes" two kiwis a day to her patients to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help with digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help with digestion&lt;/a&gt; and deliver a boost of vitamins and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hesitate to say there's any one magic fruit out there that will cure all your gut health woes, but in some respects, kiwis do seem to rise above some of the other tried-and-true methods out there, like prunes or psyllium fiber," Pasricha told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-common-foods-before-bed-could-trigger-sweet-dreams-night-terrors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating These Common Foods Before Bed Could Trigger Sweet Dreams Or Night Terrors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating These Common Foods Before Bed Could Trigger Sweet Dreams Or Night Terrors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single kiwi packs up to eight grams of fiber, which prevents constipation and promotes regular bowel movements, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the superfood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the superfood&lt;/a&gt; also contains actinidin, an enzyme that helps digestion by breaking down proteins.

			&lt;p&gt;Don't like Mondays? You might be at higher risk of stress-related health problems, including cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern society has built up Mondays to be the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-how-to-rewire-your-brain-so-you-actually-look-forward-to-mondays"&gt;least-liked day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the week. We've just come back from a relaxing weekend and now have to face all the responsibilities we've been ignoring, knowing there's the longest possible time before another weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did a recent study by researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) identify a link between anxiety towards the first day of the working week and elevated levels of a stress hormone, the connection persisted even after retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While correlations do not equal causation, a jump in the stress signal cortisol is closely connected with risk of illnesses. Which could explain why a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-004-8783-6"&gt;2005 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that there's anywhere up to a 19 percent increase in cardiovascular events on Mondays compared to other days of the week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-confirm-the-worst-day-of-the-week-for-severe-heart-attacks?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Confirm The Worst Day of The Week For Severe Heart Attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this latest study, researchers investigated a possible link between feelings of anxiety towards Mondays and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined 3,511 adults aged 50 years and over, taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA). Participants reported their levels of anxiety on different days of the week, while hair samples were also taken and analyzed for levels of the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who reported feeling particularly anxious on Mondays had cortisol levels around 23 percent higher than those who felt anxious on other days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167289" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-642x381.jpg" alt="Not Liking Mondays Could Be Killing You" class="wp-image-167289 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-642x381.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-699x415.jpg 699w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-768x456.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-1536x911.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-2048x1215.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167289" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Charts illustrating levels of cortisol and Monday anxiety. (Chandola et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Aff.

But chronic stress can overstimulate the HPA axis and lead to immune system issues, metabolic diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="167282" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="167282" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be the biological mechanism behind the earlier findings of increases in cardiovascular events on Mondays, suggests the team on the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem like an obvious work-related hazard, but strangely the study found that even retirees still felt higher stress levels on Mondays, along with the negative health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mondays act as a cultural 'stress amplifier'," &lt;a href="https://www.hku.hk/press/press-releases/detail/28420.html"&gt;says Tarani Chandola&lt;/a&gt;, sociologist at HKU. "For some older adults, the week's transition triggers a biological cascade that lingers for months. This isn't about work – it's about how deeply ingrained Mondays are in our stress physiology, even after careers end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Garfield was onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119611"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It cannot be passed from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases have been found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Brazil has the most cases, with over 141,000, followed by Argentina with over 2,500 so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, there have been approximately 220,000 chikungunya cases and 80 related deaths across 14 countries/territories since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Réunion and Mayotte, two French islands off the east coast of Africa, have ongoing outbreaks of chikungunya, with the former recording 51,000 cases as of May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayotte has seen 560 cases, with the island moved to the epidemic phase, which indicates intense and widespread transmission of the virus throughout the territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of dengue and chikungunya virus in mainland Europe has been linked by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to travellers who have caught the virus outside the region, then gone to countries within Europe with &lt;a href="/topic/mosquitoes"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; that are able to carry the virus after biting the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk of locally acquired chikungunya and dengue virus transmissions is therefore increasing,” the ECDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Chikungunya’ comes from a word used by the Makonde people in Tanzania, where the disease was first discovered in the 1950s, which means “that which bends up”. This describes the contorted posture of infected people who experience severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside joint pain, people can also experience an abrupt onset of fever, joint swelling, muscle pain, headaches, nausea, fatigue and rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint pain can be debilitating and usually lasts for a few days, but it has been known to last for weeks, months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an infected person does not experience joint pain, the symptoms will be mild and can go unrecognised as chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will recover fully from the infection. There have been some occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications, while newborns and older people with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with severe disease should be hospitalised because of the risk of organ damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once someone has recovered from chikungunya, they are likely to be immune to future chikungunya infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government has approved a vaccine against chikungunya disease, containing a form of the virus that has been weakened so it cannot multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine works by training the immune system to recognise the virus, which will then produce specific antibodies to attack it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can only be obtained via a prescription and given to those who plan to travel abroad where the virus is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the government released a further announcement to say that the Commission on Human Medicines has temporarily restricted the use of the vaccine in people aged 65 and over as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, the World Health Organisation advises using insecticides; wearing clothing that minimises skin exposure; using window and door screens, and insecticide-treated mosquito nets; and applying certain repellants to skin and clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A travel doctor’s guide on being prepared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Dawood, a travel medical specialist at Fleet Street Clinic, explained to &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; how the vaccination can help travellers prevent getting sick from the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “This is a new situation for us. Until a very short time ago, we had no vaccine, and the only approach to prevention was to make careful use of insect repellents and insect precautions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So now we've got this extra tool in the armoury, and because the vaccine gives long-lasting protection, it's something that could be considered if you are planning to travel over a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a fairly expensive vaccine, but if you're going to be travelling over a period of years to Southern Europe and beyond, it may be something that could be considered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about getting the vaccination for a trip to France, Mr Dawood advised to look at the decision in terms of where you will be travelling over the next few years rather than in the context of a single trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk from a one-off short trip to France is probably very small,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's been only a very small number of cases so far. So statistically, you're not very likely to, but over time, as somebody who loves to travel and loves going to hot countries, then I would probably want to be protected against it in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are travelling, Mr Dawood advised holidaymakers to “do your homework”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “If there's an actual outbreak at your destination, then I would say no hesitation, definitely have the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking a bit of time and getting some really focused travel health advice for your particular trip is very worthwhile because it can save you from getting a vaccine that you don't need or that may not be sensible for you, and it can help prioritise the really important things for your trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel clinics can also offer advice on things like insect bite precautions and reducing the risk in other ways, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/green-list-travel-with-simon-calder-and-the-independent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more travel news and advice, listen to Simon Calder’s podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxObmtYX2VaUFpjMVRFUDRlWmlLeGdJQ2hfR0t1bEF6Tzk3ZmpwTGZfUklSLXFOS0pCMjEzRzJGZUNSRHRYRkdfZktJSi1CZ3Y4WWdYYkJnRk9LMHNOOGs5NFI3Z0hPaTcyUjJpbjNFRGtoZE9ZSHprNW9TV1hYU0Utd0NoekFxYURlNHhHbm1OR3YzUUtvWW0tX1FacWNkRXlKTFRlVUt0ZklUeWFD</guid></item><item><title>需要多少阳光才能获得足够的维生素D ？ - WKBN.com | How much sun is needed to get enough vitamin D? - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGtyWGhTUmtJSFFrd21Oa0N1dlo5bFhIUXRidm1sUVR3UGNNWUpUMm5hN1ZCRFg2OFJuOU5VT1RVMEhOdURKQTE0UFI4cDgxQXozVnk4RnVJd0lSc3ZrR2F5VVAyZExEdzN5RkhQajNraGdaY2E2ZkYyYVNCNXJQWnNQMWhMSm50aW5hdtIBkgFBVV95cUxPSmdSTVlybVo5MThqeHlGS05idU9Nd3ZsV3BnN2ktQnJMdkpNb05QS0RNVjRud1hqWUdSY2swOHEtb3poQjAzRXpUd1FtTThCMDdvd09uTElLVDNVc1p1bVp6NW9JdERxR2RuYURQQUlOeHp3Z2x6aGlfcTF0M1V5bW5iS1o4RENjVUdOTUN4cnNtQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;(WKBN) – Now that it’s summertime, more people are spending time in the sun to get vitamin D — and doctors say that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is important for bone and cardiovascular health, as well as for the immune system and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You only need a few minutes of sun exposure several times a week. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-sunshine-you-need-daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure each day is enough for vitamin D production, and can also boost your mood and improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some foods have vitamin D, it’s usually not enough. The sun is the best source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplements are also available but you should talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep in mind that if you are taking vitamin D through a supplement, that it may interact with some of the medications that you may also be taking for other conditions. For instance, certain cholesterol medications, certain blood pressure medications and certain heart medications may actually interact with vitamin D. So check with your doctor to make sure that you’re not taking anything that could potentially be hurting you,” said Dr. Neha Vyas, with the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She says to remember to wear sunscreen when you’re out in the sun — it won’t stop you from getting vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116574" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that stress related to election news and the buildup before the election was linked to higher risks of depression and anxiety among young adults. Interestingly, stress about the election results themselves was not tied to increased mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to examine how different aspects of election-related stress affect mental health among young adults in the United States. Presidential elections are among the most high-profile events in American civic life, and in recent years they have become increasingly stressful for many people. Past studies have shown a rise in stress levels during election seasons, but few have looked closely at how specific kinds of election-related stress might relate to clinical symptoms of depression or anxiety. This study was designed to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 presidential race was particularly intense. It came after years of political turmoil and was marked by widespread concerns about threats to democracy, fears of election-related violence, and deep divisions in public opinion. Many Americans reported feeling overwhelmed or anxious during the election period. For young adults, who are still developing emotionally and often face financial and social instability, this kind of stress can be especially hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how election stress affects young people’s mental health, researchers used data from the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES), a long-running survey of young adults in the United States. This study followed participants from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic into early 2025. The current analysis focused on a group of 778 people who completed surveys both in 2022 and in the months following the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at three kinds of election-related stress: distress in the lead-up to the election, distress caused by the election outcome, and distress from news coverage related to the election. They used standard screening tools to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, looking specifically for signs that participants might be at risk for at least moderate levels of these conditions. They also accounted for a wide range of background factors, such as participants’ political views, education level, employment status, race, gender identity, and sexual orientation, as well as prior mental health history, financial distress, and emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that stress from election-related news was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Young adults who felt more distressed by the news around the time of the election were more likely to score above the clinical threshold for moderate depression and anxiety symptoms. Stress in the weeks and months before the election—the anticipation phase—was also linked to increased depression symptoms, but it was not tied to anxiety symptoms. Surprisingly, stress related to the actual results of the election did not predict symptoms of either depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that some groups were more vulnerable than others. Participants who identified as part of gender or sexual minority groups were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Financial stress was also a strong predictor of both depression and anxiety. Having symptoms of depression or anxiety in 2022 was a powerful predictor of whether someone would still meet the threshold for those conditions in 2025. These patterns suggest that both existing mental health challenges and ongoing life stressors continue to shape how young adults respond to political stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that stress from constant exposure to news—especially on social media—may play a major role in shaping young adults’ emotional responses to elections. Because young people are more likely to get their news online, they may be more affected by the constant stream of political content. Even those who try to avoid politics may struggle to tune it out. This constant exposure may lead to feelings of helplessness, fear, or hopelessness, all of which are associated with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News about the 2024 election may have been especially distressing for this sample, which was predominantly made up of liberal-identifying women and individuals from gender or sexual minority groups. Many of the key issues covered in election news—such as reproductive rights and transgender healthcare—directly affect these groups. As a result, these participants may have felt personally threatened by some of the policies or rhetoric they saw in the news. This could help explain why news-related stress had such a strong link to mental health symptoms in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory stress, or stress experienced in the lead-up to the election, was also linked to a higher risk of depression. This kind of stress may have contributed to depressive symptoms by fueling negative thoughts, emotional fatigue, or feelings of powerlessness. In contrast, it did not appear to increase anxiety. The researchers speculate that this may be because many participants in the study were already bracing themselves for an outcome they viewed as likely, which may have led to sadness and withdrawal rather than fear or panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, stress about the election result itself—whether participants were upset about who won or lost—was not linked to an increased risk of either depression or anxiety. This finding runs counter to the assumption that disappointment or outrage over the outcome is the most emotionally damaging part of the election. Instead, it suggests that the stress leading up to the vote, and the non-stop news coverage surrounding it, may be more harmful than the result itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out some limitations in their study. For instance, the measures of election-related stress were based on single questions, which might not capture all the nuances of how people experience stress. Because some of the stress questions were asked after the election, it’s possible that participants’ answers were influenced by the results. But the study’s design controlled for many background factors, which helps strengthen the reliability of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that mental health professionals may need to pay closer attention to the emotional toll of election periods, particularly among young adults. For people who are already experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, the months leading up to an election may be a time of increased vulnerability. Clinicians might consider helping patients manage their media consumption, use cognitive behavioral techniques to address unhelpful thought patterns, or practice mindfulness to reduce anticipatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers call for more real-time studies to understand how people react emotionally during political events. Future work could also examine whether similar patterns appear among politically conservative or moderate young adults, or how different types of news content affect stress levels. The study adds to growing evidence that politics can have a powerful impact on emotional well-being—especially for those just beginning to find their place in civic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116574" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2024 presidential election stress and its association with depression and anxiety among U.S. young adults: A two-wave survey study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Chang Zhao, G.

&lt;p&gt;Fiber supports healthy digestion, helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and promotes a sense of fullness that can aid in appetite and weight management. It’s also linked to a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, including colorectal and colon, Zenker noted. “Low fiber diets are linked to microbiome imbalances and lower microbial diversity, both of which are associated with increased risk of inflammatory diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different types of fiber offer different benefits. “Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol — great for patients with diabetes or heart disease risk,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bespokeconciergemd.com/providers/dr-michael-ednie" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7907052" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Ednie&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Bespoke Concierge MD based in Scottsdale, Arizona. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. “Insoluble fiber promotes regularity and helps prevent constipation, which is crucial for colon health,” Ednie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s prebiotic fiber, which serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut. “As those bacteria ferment prebiotic fibers, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory effects and support gut barrier function. Prebiotics have also been linked to improved mineral absorption and even mood regulation via the gut-brain connection,” Ednie said. Garlic, onions, bananas and asparagus are all excellent sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like variety in your overall diet supports better nutrition, eating different types of fiber helps build a healthier, more resilient gut microbiome. “Different fibers feed different strains of beneficial bacteria, which leads to better gut health, stronger immune function and lower inflammation overall,” Ednie explained. While there’s no strict formula for how much of each fiber type you need, he suggests aiming for about two-thirds insoluble fiber and one-third soluble fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing can backfire on your digestive system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — They face different symptoms of Long COVID, but they all share one common experience — finding answers at a clinic run by Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three years, Emily, 34, from St. Louis, said she suffered with crushing fatigue, nausea, a racing heart rate and difficulty breathing after getting COVID-19 in August 2020. Her first appointment with a nurse at the Care and Recovery After COVID-19 (CARE) Clinic was life changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said everything I was describing was in line with the experiences of other patients and consistent with what we know about Long COVID,” Emily said. “After three years, I could name my condition definitively, and a health care professional wasn’t afraid to take my suffering seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WashU clinic opened in October 2020 — about seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic — and &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_abfd9080-8434-5253-9dba-ae8d50e1659e.html" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of patients have since come through its doors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now those patients are facing confusion and distress after being told the clinic would  be closing at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several interviewed by the Post-Dispatch say they’ve been given vague reasons as to why. Their future appointments have been canceled, and they are unsure how their care will be coordinated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients only wanted to be identified by their first names because of stigma associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am terrified to lose access to the only doctors who not only believed but understood me,” said Jess, 36, of St. Louis. “I’ve come so far in my progress, and I am scared to lose everything I’ve worked so hard for without the support of Long COVID-competent providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/victoria-j-fraser" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Victoria Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the university’s Department of Medicine, said plans to close the clinic were spurred by the abrupt departure of its leading physician, whose spouse got a job in another state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got unfortunately very short notice that she was leaving, so we really didn’t have another physician to take over the practice,” Fraser said in an interview Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is working on a “transition plan,” she said, which may involve replacing the physician and reopening the clinic, or it may not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, university leaders are making sure that patients — many of whom have complex conditions — continue to receive ongoing care from their team of specialists, Fraser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why the transition is not super-simple at this point,” she said. “We’re working with a number of different specialists to figure out how we can care for these patients in the best way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/specialties/infectious-diseases/post-covid-19-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;clinic’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which had informed visitors of the closure and directed patients to ask their primary care physicians for “the appropriate specialist,” was updated Friday to say the university is working on a transition plan for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;We remain fully committed to providing high-quality care and support to individuals living with Long COVID, and we will share additional information with patients as plans for the clinic are finalized&lt;/span&gt;,” it now states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site provides a phone number and email address of a community health worker who can connect callers to medical specialists and support resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients say they are fearful that losing the clinic means losing a knowledgeable resource on the latest Long COVID research, referrals to specialists who have developed expertise in treating Long COVID symptoms and access to participating in clinical trials for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fear they will lose the progress they have made in improving their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma, 38, of St. Louis County, was healthy and lifting weights five days a week before she got COVID-19 in May 2022. She found her way to the CARE Clinic after six months of dealing with extreme fatigue, migraines, nausea, allergic reactions and other symptoms. Until then, providers had only responded to her with shoulder shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the therapeutics and the referrals I’ve gotten from the Long COVID clinic, I am just now starting to get something that resemblances a life back,” Emma said. “I can tend my garden. I can play with my nieces. Stairs are still my nemesis, but they don’t knock me down anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also worry about those who get sick in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Losing the CARE Clinic is a devastating blow. It affects current patients who have spent years struggling with daily tasks and also future patients who will need answers, support and treatment,” said Alex, 36, of Jefferson County. “The closure of this clinic makes it feel like help is slipping away when we need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID’s broad reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela, 47, who lives in the Metro East, found herself with debilitating neurological issues, chest pains and gastrointestinal problems after getting COVID in June 2022. A year later, she has lost her 20-year career in the utility industry and become disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her husband working, her two sons have become her caregivers, she said. “It is truly a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to the clinic, however, gave her hope for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt; is a chronic condition that includes a wide range of symptoms that occur after a COVID-19 infection and last at least three months. The symptoms can range from mild to severe — including organ damage and blood clots — and can even result in a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 23 million Americans had symptoms of Long COVID in 2023, &lt;a href="https://covid19community.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/CEAL-WhatYouNeedtoKnowLongCOVID-English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. The burden is thought to be even higher now — &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf030/7972782?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;around 44 million&lt;/a&gt;.

And about a quarter of adults with the disease report significant limitations in performing daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Long COVID clinics opened across the country at the start of pandemic, but many are now closed, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/long-covid-clinics-closing/682251" target="_blank"&gt;according to an April article published in The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reporter called 171 clinics and found 61 had closed, 15 were unreachable and 11 did not have a medical doctor or nurse on staff. Only 79 were accepting new patients. The closest to St. Louis are in Kansas City and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only clinic in North Carolina — the University of North Carolina COVID Recovery Clinic — closed its doors last month. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/patient-services/services-and-specialties/covid-recovery-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;A press release&lt;/a&gt; blamed “the loss of multiple funding sources,” with officials &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article308422905.html" target="_blank"&gt;offering few details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closures come as Long COVID remains poorly understood and managed. No prescriptions, supplements or over-the-counter medications are approved to prevent or treat Long COVID, and more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each clinic that shuts down, our communities lose not just care but also hope for recovery and a better quality of life,” said Laurie Jones, executive director of the worldwide patient advocacy organization &lt;a href="https://www.meaction.net" target="_blank"&gt;#MEAction&lt;/a&gt;, especially as people continue to get COVID-19. “Shutting down these clinics is not only harmful, it’s dangerously short-sighted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-releases/long-covid-grant-awards.html" target="_blank"&gt;undertook efforts to increase understanding of the disease and improve care&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal spending and crack down on student protests it deems as antisemitic has caused &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/myalgic-encephalomyelitis-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-columbia-program-shutdown" target="_blank"&gt;post-COVID research programs at universities like Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; to take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a “reorganization,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in March &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/trump-administration-shuttering-office-of-long-covid-research-and-practice-00246836" target="_blank"&gt;also shut down&lt;/a&gt; the Long COVID Advisory Committee and the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which helped coordinate Long COVID research across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(25)00094-1/fulltext#:~:text=Millions" target="_blank"&gt;HHS also tried to cancel&lt;/a&gt; a $1.7 billion federal Long COVID research program — &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org" target="_blank"&gt;Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)&lt;/a&gt; — stating it would “no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research program was rescued from the chopping block after pushback from patients and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program recently discovered that &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/recover-research-qa-pediatric-long-covid" target="_blank"&gt;up to 5.8 million American children have Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting it could now be the most common chronic condition among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington University is one of 12 universities participating in the RECOVER research program, which aims to accelerate scientific progress and provide patients with services they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university was awarded a &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/long-covid-clinic-expanding-reach-to-vulnerable-metro-rural-communities" target="_blank"&gt;five-year $4.5 million RECOVER grant in the fall of 2023 to identity patient needs and improve care across Missouri&lt;/a&gt; through efforts such as working with community clinics and the University of Missouri to increase primary care physicians’ knowledge about the disease, especially in underserved and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is &lt;a href="https://stlouisihn.org/our-work/clinical-community-integration/long-covid-care" target="_blank"&gt;also participating in studies&lt;/a&gt; testing medications to improve symptoms such as fast heart rate, dizziness and fatigue; a rehabilitation program to prevent energy crashes; and a procedure to improve the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;University officials say the research will continue and not be impacted by the clinic’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the university did not disclose the number of patients the clinic has been treating, Fraser mentioned that the figure “has been declining significantly” over time. These slowing numbers have also been seen nationally, she said, as patients’ symptoms gradually improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there still are a number of patients who are suffering, and we understand that and want to best help them however we can,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Terrified of backsliding’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients at the CARE clinic say they have been guided through numerous helpful interventions, including simple things such as compression stockings, not eating certain fruits and vegetables, drinking salt water and taking antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They describe receiving physical therapy plans that understand how their energy can be depleted and send them into a worsening cycle — knowledge that has helped many maintain their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also funneled them to specialists in areas such as cardiology, neurology and orthopedics that became experienced in identifying symptoms and treatment strategies tailored to each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess describes having gone from needing a wheelchair to being able to go on a 20-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily said after her first appointment, she started speech, occupational and physical therapy with practitioners who had built a body of knowledge to support Long COVID patients. She learned skills to help her memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Long COVID clinic was a door to health care professionals who were actively researching, learning and re-tooling effective approaches,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rusti Levin, 72, of St. Louis, said she caught COVID-19 for the first time in February and went to the clinic in May. During a two-hour appointment, she learned lifestyle interventions and was connected to an array of specialists. Now her follow-up appointment at the clinic in November has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what to expect,” Levin said. “I will wait to hear from the different departments to see what is happening with the rest of the Long COVID specialists, and if I can continue to see them in spite of the clinic shutting down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also brought clinical trials to St. Louis, which many patients say they participate in. Now, they fear losing the clinic could also mean losing access to future trials and a local pipeline for innovative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without a dedicated Long COVID clinic, what incentive will there be for large research studies like RECOVER to come here?” Emma asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal   tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-5fe8819e-d814-5c25-8ba3-d97bf8de810b" data-instance="#gallery-items-e834303f-9b13-4bdd-a804-139cd1c6cb1e-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e834303f-9b13-4bdd-a804-139cd1c6cb1e"&gt;

The scientists sequenced remains from 1,313 individuals and found genetic traces of 214 different pathogens. These range from hepatitis B viruses to the bacterium that causes plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the study provides an opportunity for researchers to test ideas about how culture, climate, and migration changed disease pressure over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skeletons-hold-disease-secrets"&gt;Skeletons hold disease secrets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by evolutionary geneticist Eske Willerslev of the &lt;a href="https://globe.ku.dk/"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve long suspected the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease,” Willerslev said. “Now DNA shows us it happened at least 6,500 years ago.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team sifted through more than 400 billion sequencing reads and used chemical damage patterns to confirm which fragments truly came from ancient microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis uncovered infections in roughly three‑quarters of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-decipher-the-genetic-history-of-400-medieval-skeletons/"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that illness was a constant companion rather than a rare ordeal. The oldest sample, dating back about 37,000 years, contained mostly oral bacteria still common today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed that blood-borne infections didn’t show up until people began settling down, storing grain, and living closely with sheep, goats, and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farming-sparked-new-infections"&gt;Farming sparked new infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livestock pens and crowded villages arrived in Eurasia around 8,000 years ago, and the genomic record registers an immediate uptick in disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear inflection point appears at 6,500 years ago, the moment when &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563794/"&gt;zoonotic pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, the kind that jump from animals to humans, first show up consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notorious example is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01322-7"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;, the plague bacterium, whose oldest genetic trace dates back to about 5,500 years ago in western Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pushes the timeline of plague back two millennia and shows the microbe shadowing early farmers long before recorded pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-waves-of-new-infections"&gt;Waves of new infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second surge of infection follows the migration of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14507"&gt;steppe pastoralist&lt;/a&gt; groups roughly 5,000 years ago, when horse‑drawn wagons carried people, livestock, and microbes across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeletons from that period revealed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stone-age-farming-population-decimated-by-plague-dna-skull/"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, relapsing‑fever spirochetes, and the parasites that cause vivax malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such waves of infection probably devastated local communities, clearing ecological space for newcomers and turning pathogens into unlikely allies of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient immune‑gene data hint at strong selection beginning in the Bronze Age – a genetic fingerprint of relentless pressure from emerging pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-infections-from-animals"&gt;Human infections from animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catalog reveals that cowpox relatives, leptospirosis bacteria, and meat-borne yersiniosis showed up soon after pigs, sheep, and goats were domesticated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns with estimates that around 60 percent of emerging infections come from animals. Close contact clearly reshaped the disease landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found skeletons that harbored two or more bugs at once, and these co-infections can worsen outcomes. An ancient Viking‑Age skull carried both hepatitis B and plague DNA, demonstrating how mixed infections may have driven sudden mortality spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiously, no clear evidence of tuberculosis surfaced, probably because its bacteria rarely circulate in high numbers in healthy blood. But as the team notes, absence of proof doesn’t mean ancient lungs were safe – only that some microbes leave fewer traces in the molecular record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-ancient-infections-teach-doctors"&gt;What ancient infections teach doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mutations that were successful in the past are likely to reappear,” said lead author Martin Sikora. She noted that the ancient genomes can help scientists anticipate future mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine makers already test candidate antigens against panels of modern strains – a practice encouraged by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/norms-and-standards/vaccine-standardization/regulation-and-quality-control-of-vaccines"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; – and prehistoric DNA provides a deeper benchmark. Comparing lineages over millennia highlights which protein targets stay stable and which drift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old plague sequences, for instance, are missing the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8547695/"&gt;ymt gene&lt;/a&gt; that helps modern strains survive in fleas. This points to the key step that turned a local infection into a global pandemic threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar evolutionary tipping points could lurk in viruses still endemic in bats or rodents. Public‑health planners can combine the new database with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-tipping-points-how-close-are-we-to-irreversible-change/"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; and land‑use models to gauge spillover risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pathogens-rewrote-human-genes"&gt;Pathogens rewrote human genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skeletal archive captures natural selection in action. It shows that human alleles linked to inflammatory responses became more common after farming took hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same alleles, still common today, now raise the risk of autoimmune disorders in industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunologists argue that this trade‑off is the cost of survival: genes that helped ancestors fight livestock‑borne bugs can misfire in cleaner modern environments. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oldest-human-dna-ever-found-tells-story-of-lost-branch-on-human-neanderthal-family-tree/"&gt;Ancient DNA&lt;/a&gt; provides the infection history that scientists need to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infectious diseases have left lasting impressions on human genomes, as selective pressures from pathogens have continuously shaped human genetic variation,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where and when different human pathogens first emerged, how and why they spread, and how they affected human populations are important but largely unresolved questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09192-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQYWFjTFlEZHlXWWQwM1paczZOcGhmcmRxNG80cjkyZU1IOUE5clo3aTlpUWU5N1FZUU5BWWVLSnBMVXA0YnNFb0J4UU9PS3V5QTFEZnVMNGwzS0ctZ0NrZFVkQ1h5UEY5SF9xNGRXcURWeDJhaTVRNXhJS19HdEt4VUJQX25iUkNkS0MwdzU0TQ</guid></item><item><title>哌甲酯： ADHD药物仅抑制男性的冲动性，与大脑接线差异有关- PsyPost | Methylphenidate: ADHD drug curbs impulsivity in men only, linked to brain wiring differences - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQU3EzbVBoSGttZE9QbURiQy1fc2hTV0RDdm04ZVYzU3VhUGVCdVJDSGdnY0VPeTZxWEJuYm45d3NIWE9LSGhpX3lxMllCVHF2clotZDB6V0ZRNUZ6eTdmSW44aUt3bWVZOEpSY2ZGMDdtZVNUQmhIdjIwOFZodjk1TVkydGcyQjhtSEE5RW82aWxmTmJIVnF0bERtYzJHYm90dFdSVnNTejMyWG45NEhGVG1UQWwtdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p data-start="104" data-end="463"&gt;A recent study of young adults in Israel found that a 20 mg dose of methylphenidate reduces choice impulsivity in men, but not in women, immediately after taking the drug. In men, the drug’s effects appeared to be related to the structural integrity of neural fibers in the forceps major region of the corpus callosum. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811925001995?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;em data-start="450" data-end="462"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="465" data-end="886"&gt;Impulsivity refers to the tendency to act quickly without fully considering the consequences, often leading to risky or inappropriate behavior. It is a common feature of both everyday behavior and clinical conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, and certain mood disorders. Impulsivity is a complex trait that can affect decision-making, emotion regulation, and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="888" data-end="1390"&gt;There are several types of impulsivity. Motor impulsivity involves acting without thinking, such as blurting out answers or interrupting others. Attentional impulsivity is characterized by difficulty staying focused and being easily distracted. Choice impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed ones, reflecting difficulty with delaying gratification. Cognitive impulsivity involves making decisions quickly without adequately processing available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1392" data-end="1942"&gt;Study author Maryana Daood and her colleagues aimed to assess whether methylphenidate affects choice impulsivity. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can improve attention and self-control. It is sold under brand names such as Ritalin, Concerta, and Medikinet. Since impulsivity is a central feature of ADHD, verifying that a commonly used treatment reduces this specific behavior has important implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1944" data-end="2136"&gt;The study included 48 young adults recruited through advertisements at the University of Haifa in Israel. The average participant age was between 26 and 27 years, and 28 participants were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2138" data-end="2577"&gt;Each participant took part in two data collection sessions. During each session, they completed structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans—both at rest and while performing a delay discounting task, a measure of choice impulsivity. In one session, participants received a 20 mg oral dose of methylphenidate. In the other session, they received a placebo capsule identical in appearance but without active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2579" data-end="2933"&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received methylphenidate in the first session and placebo in the second; the other group received the treatments in the opposite order. Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatments knew which capsule was taken in each session, making the study double-blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2935" data-end="3206"&gt;In addition to the two experimental sessions, participants completed the delay discounting task on two earlier occasions. This task assesses how much a person devalues a reward based on the time they have to wait for it. It is commonly used to measure choice impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3208" data-end="3724"&gt;Neuroimaging data showed that men had greater white matter integrity in three brain tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation, the cingulum bundle, and the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Methylphenidate significantly reduced choice impulsivity in men but not in women. In men, the drug’s effectiveness was greater among those with lower neural fiber integrity in the forceps major. In contrast, in women, the drug’s impact was more pronounced among those with higher white matter integrity in the forceps minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, results uncover sex-specific effects of MPH [methylphenidate] on choice impulsivity, accounted for by inverse associations between choice impulsivity under MPH and the structural integrity of distinct segments of the corpus callosum,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of methylphenidate on choice impulsivity. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a small group of healthy young adults, not on individuals with ADHD or with increased impulsivity. Results on larger groups or on individuals with particularly high impulsivity might differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121196"&gt;The impact of methylphenidate on choice impulsivity is inversely associated with corpus callosum fiber integrity across sexes,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Maryana Daood , Leehe Peled-Avron , Rachel Ben-Hayun , Michael Nevat , Judith Aharon-Peretz , Rachel Tomer , and Roee Admon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:06:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQU3EzbVBoSGttZE9QbURiQy1fc2hTV0RDdm04ZVYzU3VhUGVCdVJDSGdnY0VPeTZxWEJuYm45d3NIWE9LSGhpX3lxMllCVHF2clotZDB6V0ZRNUZ6eTdmSW44aUt3bWVZOEpSY2ZGMDdtZVNUQmhIdjIwOFZodjk1TVkydGcyQjhtSEE5RW82aWxmTmJIVnF0bERtYzJHYm90dFdSVnNTejMyWG45NEhGVG1UQWwtdw</guid></item><item><title>由健康专家支持的自然缓解头痛的食物- CNET | Foods That Naturally Relieve Headaches, Backed by Health Pros - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNQnV2SVdSYXExUHAxbmZiWk9rQU1uRnJIZi1yOHdYQXZQd0lfMEZzVzRkZW1ObC00YS1jZ1ExaHlhbmJjT0NDX3ZLWVlXNjJfNVdyVHEzdlJPYzRadFBTd05aWkJCaTBzYzA0bi1PYkNSVnM3WXRwMFFHbGM1SC1wclM4VC1oVUxuc3dkWjJ1ZmlWRlM1Q0dwRXYzUGx4UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;What you eat could be the key to easing your headache or migraine symptoms. Though adjusting your diet is far from a miracle cure, when paired with other healthy habits, like maintaining your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/summer-hydration-daily-water-requirements/" target="_self"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;, getting enough exercise, getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and managing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-strategies-to-reduce-stress-and-feel-more-joy-today/" target="_self"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, it's a low-effort way to relieve your pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"The most important thing I tell patients is that migraines are highly individualized," says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Church&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified member of the American Board of Family Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians. "What helps one person may not help another, and what's a trigger for one might be therapeutic for someone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church advises patients to keep a "headache diary" to track these factors and see if they notice any triggers. To understand how what you eat can affect your headaches, we talked to dietitians and doctors to determine which foods ease symptoms and which might be contributing to your pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Omega-3-rich foods like walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/health-benefits-omega-3-foods-add-into-diet-with-these-foods/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3-rich&lt;/a&gt; fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines," says Church. "These fish are high in anti-inflammatory fats (EPA and DHA), which can reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the vascular system and brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_self"&gt;2021 randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;, Church explains that because migraines are believed to involve inflammatory and vascular changes in the body, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-omega-3-supplements-for-a-healthy-heart/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce their frequency or intensity when eaten regularly. "The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions like inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish also contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/feel-low-on-energy-try-these-11-vitamin-d-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins like riboflavin, which support healthy brain metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" target="_self"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323014503#sec5" target="_self"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealing that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of migraines. She adds that plant-based sources include chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia and flax seeds are great sources of omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;mikroman6/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Magnesium-rich foods like spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uws.edu/faculty/byname/daniel_redwood/" target="_self"&gt;Daniel Redwood&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine at the University of Western States, explains, "Attention to the potential importance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in migraine grew in prominence with the discovery (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2584000/" target="_self"&gt;Ramadan, 1989&lt;/a&gt;) that people with migraines had lower levels of this mineral in their red blood cells, serum and brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Daidone, medical director at &lt;a href="https://trueselfrecovery.com/" target="_self"&gt;True Self Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, seconds this, stating that food rich in magnesium -- like pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado -- may reduce the severity and occurrence of migraines. He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912646/" target="_self"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; examining the potential connection between magnesium deficiency and migraine, which describes how magnesium deficiency is implicated in migraine attacks due to processes like cortical spreading depression, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance and electrolyte imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although clinical evidence of the acute dietary magnesium deficiency as a direct migraine trigger remains limited, scientists are investigating the involvement of intra- and extracellular magnesium levels in migraine pathogenesis," Daidone explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schonze Del Pozo, a board-certified internal medicine physician and medical director at &lt;a href="https://eastsacconcierge.com" target="_self"&gt;East Sacramento Concierge&lt;/a&gt;, states that many of the patients she sees for headaches and migraines are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;deficient in magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. She also cites a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22426836/" target="_self"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Neural Transmission entitled "Why all migraine patients should be treated with magnesium." As a result, she recommends a healthy diet of magnesium-rich dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ginger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many swear by ginger as a way to help with migraines," states &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drknobel/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, a general practitioner and medical director of &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/" target="_self"&gt;Medical Cert UK&lt;/a&gt;. "Studies have proven that ginger reduces nausea and can decrease the inflammation that leads to migraine pain. Ginger has helped patients during my practice, whether they take it as ginger tea or in supplement form." She references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/" target="_self"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; that found ginger powder to be as effective as the medication sumatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks, but with fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea may be especially beneficial because, Knöbel states, "It's important to drink enough water, as well as eat ginger. Drinking enough water might stop your migraine from getting any worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/dont-miss-out-on-the-7-hidden-health-benefits-of-ginger/" target="_self"&gt;ginger because it contains&lt;/a&gt; natural anti-inflammatory compounds like gingerol. "I've had patients find relief from migraines or migraine-related nausea using ginger tea, powder or chews," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%222019%20study%22}" target="_self"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; also found that 400mg of ginger extract, in addition to 100mg of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, may help treat migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea combines the benefits of ginger with the hydration of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Muhamad Zulkarnaen/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Nuts and seeds like pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another group of foods I recommend are nuts and seeds, including almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts," Church states. "Like leafy greens, these are rich in magnesium, and some also provide &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-e-health-benefits-nutritional-sources-and-drawbacks/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, which has been shown to help with menstrual migraines and migraines with aura." A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4359851/#sec3" target="_self"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; reflected this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cinnamon contains a high amount of antioxidants that may also reduce headache frequency," Campbell explains. "Stir it into your morning oatmeal or tea, or bake it into muffins and breads." She cites a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638445/" target="_self"&gt;2020 trial&lt;/a&gt;, stating, "Studies suggest that cinnamon supplementation may lower inflammation, cutting down on migraine frequency, severity and duration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants in cinnamon may help treat headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Foods rich in vitamin B2, like eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-known [1998] &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/wnl.50.2.466?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_self"&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that 400 mg of riboflavin daily significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity over a three-month period," Church says. Though this high dose usually comes from supplementation, riboflavin-rich foods support the same metabolic processes in migraine prevention. These foods can include eggs, dairy and lean meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Riboflavin is essential for mitochondrial energy production, and many researchers believe that migraines stem in part from dysfunction in energy metabolism within brain cells," Church adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redwood adds, "There exists a small but promising body of research on the effectiveness of some nutritional supplements for migraines, especially riboflavin (vitamin B2), coenzyme Q10 and magnesium. The first research-based indicator of riboflavin's potential as a migraine treatment appeared in a small 1946 article by a medical physician, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which reported dramatic effectiveness from what would now be considered low-dose B2 supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779525/" target="_self"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analysis found that supplementation of 400mg/day of vitamin B2 for three months affected the duration, frequency and pain score of migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs, dairy and lean meats &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Turmeric &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric and, according to Campbell, is "high in antioxidant power and shines especially when paired with omega-3s." To add it to your diet, consider sprinkling it into smoothies, curries or teas.

Whole grains like brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church mentions that whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and oats may also be beneficial since they "provide a steady release of glucose, preventing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;blood sugar crashes&lt;/a&gt; that can trigger headaches, and are good sources of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins and trace minerals."

However, additional studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; quinoa, brown rice and oats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Water-rich foods like watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drkimberlyidoko/?hl=en" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Kimberly Idoko&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental neurobiologist and board-certified neurologist, reveals that dehydration can also trigger headaches, which is why staying hydrated can significantly improve migraine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/eat-your-way-to-peak-hydration-with-these-6-electrolyte-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;Water-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumber, watermelon and citrus fruits also help you stay hydrated," adds Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent dehydration-caused headaches or migraines, enjoy more water-rich foods like watermelon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anucha Muphasa/500px/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods that may trigger headaches or migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate, cheese and alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; "In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403039/" target="_self"&gt;[2007] study&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 migraine sufferers, 44% reported at least one food as a trigger.

Over a 5-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week," says Redwood. "At the end of a gradual withdrawal period (because too speedy a withdrawal can trigger even worse headaches), 33 of these 36 young people were headache-free, a truly stunning result. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine (&lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00414.x" target="_self"&gt;Chou and Bell, 2007&lt;/a&gt;)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: 11 quarts of cola per week is extreme, and the average person doesn't consume this much caffeine. Moderate caffeine intake is still OK, according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City who is also part of CNET's medical review board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to caffeine, Church notes, "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/cutting-back-on-coffee-is-hard-tips-for-making-it-easier/" target="_self"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, used strategically, can enhance the absorption of pain relievers and constrict dilated blood vessels in the brain, which may ease migraine pain. This is why many over-the-counter headache medications include it. Studies have shown that 40–100 mg of caffeine (the amount in a small cup of coffee or strong tea) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5655397/#:~:text=This%20review%20provides%20evidence%20for,mg%20enhance%20benefits%20in%20migraine." target="_self"&gt;can reduce migraine&lt;/a&gt; or tension headache pain. But, chronic overuse can lead to rebound headaches, so moderation is key."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added sugars and highly processed foods:&lt;/strong&gt; "Research has shown that people following a 'Western' diet, which includes substantial amounts of added sugars and other highly processed foods, are at greater than average risk for developing migraines, while the risk is significantly lower than average for those following a healthier diet," states Redwood. download (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joseph Mercola, a board-certified family physician and author of &lt;span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Guide-Cellular-Health-Unlocking/dp/1965429009" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-aps-asin="1965429009" data-aps-asc-tag="cnet-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|-|dtp|cn" section="transformed-regular-link" data-location="BODY"&gt;Your Guide to Cellular Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, adds that in addition to incorporating foods rich in specific nutrients like magnesium and B vitamins, you'll want to eliminate triggers like processed foods that contain nitrates, MSG, added sugars or yeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNQnV2SVdSYXExUHAxbmZiWk9rQU1uRnJIZi1yOHdYQXZQd0lfMEZzVzRkZW1ObC00YS1jZ1ExaHlhbmJjT0NDX3ZLWVlXNjJfNVdyVHEzdlJPYzRadFBTd05aWkJCaTBzYzA0bi1PYkNSVnM3WXRwMFFHbGM1SC1wclM4VC1oVUxuc3dkWjJ1ZmlWRlM1Q0dwRXYzUGx4UQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，吃早餐减肥的最佳时间- EatingWell | The Best Time to Eat Breakfast for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc2h1azRCLS01YXlRQllHbE1QRDZSc2d4Z3JqNHJDd08tRGhua2V4YnBaUTU0djhxVmlxR2JvYkxCVFBBVDlpN1hUbEhtZVBEanZGc182NGZrT0taemNfbUtCbG53Q1B2SGtpQzc0VWhNT3pMTjJmdzMxeGY0NnpKU0l5UHA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating early in the day and front-loading your calories supports greater weight loss versus eating later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts suggest eating breakfast at least 12 hours after your last meal for the most benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is linked to better diet quality, cognitive benefits and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And experts agree that, in most cases, some breakfast is better than no breakfast. That’s because skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of obesity, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But does it matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we eat breakfast? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826585/best-times-to-eat-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal timing is important&lt;/a&gt;, especially for weight loss. “Studies show that front-loading calories earlier in the day supports greater weight loss, even under the same daily calorie intake,” says &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-fencl-rd-cd-35a6251b2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lindsay Fencl, RD, CD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what dietitians have to say about the best time to eat breakfast, why eating earlier might be better and the many other benefits of breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-is-the-best-time-to-eat-breakfast-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why This Is the Best Time to Eat Breakfast for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating earlier in the day aligns naturally with your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s internal clock, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, hormone release and metabolism. In other words, our bodies are more efficient earlier in the day, when it comes to digesting food and burning calories, as compared to the latter part of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It makes sense when you think about it: Food provides fuel, and you need that energy when you’re awake during the day versus when you’re sleeping at night. In fact, studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891068/best-worst-late-night-snacks-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;late-night eating&lt;/a&gt; is associated with weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when should we eat breakfast? “There is not an exact time that is best to have breakfast, as this may depend on the person and their typical schedule,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “However, it’s clear that eating something matters, as research suggests a connection to eating earlier and greater weight loss.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mitri does suggest waiting to eat breakfast until at least 12 hours after your previous meal as a good starting point, due to the metabolic benefits of an overnight fast. “For example, if you ate dinner at 7 p.m., then your breakfast would be at 7 a.m. or later,” explains Mitri.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one study that found a sweet spot when it comes to specific breakfast timing and weight loss. Results of the study showed that eating breakfast between 6:45 and 7:30 a.m. led to more weight loss over 12 weeks versus eating breakfast between 8:10 and 9:10 a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Caveat: This was one study. More research needs to be done to validate these findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-benefits-of-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Benefits of Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Near- and Long-Term Brain Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast could protect your brain from age-related cognitive decline. A recent study provided cognitive tests to more than 850 adults every 18 months. The researchers also looked for signs of neurodegeneration. The results showed that breakfast skippers did not perform as well on the cognitive tests compared to those who ate breakfast. Those who skipped the first meal of the day were also at greater risk of experiencing cognitive decline and signs of neurodegeneration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A quality breakfast, ideally consumed within two to three hours of waking, is linked to a wide range of health benefits, including better mood, improved cognitive function, smarter food choices and more effective weight management,” says Fencl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Increases Diet Quality &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast may lead to eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher-quality diet&lt;/a&gt; overall. Research shows that skipping breakfast led to a two-point decrease in Healthy Eating Index Scores. Missing the first meal of the day lowered scores in the fruit, whole grain, dairy and empty calories categories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Risk of Cardiovascular Disease &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A quality breakfast can also do your heart some good. A clinical trial found that subjects who consumed 20% to 30% of their total calories at breakfast had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines, along with a 9% to 18% reduction in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035440/what-causes-high-triglycerides/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;triglyceride levels&lt;/a&gt; and a 4% to 8% increase in HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to eating a balanced breakfast early in the day, and at least 12 hours after your last meal, follow these other habits for successful weight management. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced lunch and dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;At most lunches and dinners, aim to follow the balanced plate framework, making half your plate vegetables, a quarter of your plate whole grains and a quarter of your plate protein. This helps keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mostly whole foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Choose whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and legumes. These foods not only pack protein and fiber to keep you full, but also provide important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that keep inflammation at bay. Consume refined sugars in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your steps in. &lt;/strong&gt;Walking is one of the most underrated forms of exercise for weight loss. Research shows that walking for 50 minutes, just four times a week (at moderate to vigorous intensity) can help with weight loss and losing fat in the belly region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift weights. &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training helps build and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-maintain-muscle-mass-while-losing-weight-8706542" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preserve lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;. When you lose weight, you lose both fat and muscle, unless you’re doing something to preserve that muscle mass. Less muscle means a slower metabolism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get seven to nine hours of good-quality sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Sleep is just as important as diet and exercise when it comes to weight loss. Research shows that just one night of sleep deprivation decreases leptin, the satiety hormone, and increases ghrelin, the hunger hormone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This may lead to more snacking the next day, specifically on foods higher in fat and carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Stress leads to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;elevated cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the stress hormone. The carbs you crave when you’re stressed? It’s biological. Cortisol increases cravings for sugary and fatty foods. Elevated cortisol is also associated with an increase in belly fat. Practicing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-to-lose-weight-11739943" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;mindfulness techniques&lt;/a&gt;, meditation and exercise can all help reduce stress, which can impact weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast early in the day aligns with your circadian rhythm. Your body is more efficient in the first part of the day at digesting food and burning calories compared to the latter. When it comes to timing, experts suggest waiting at least 12 hours after your last meal. Eating breakfast is also associated with a better-quality diet, short- and long-term cognitive benefits and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;

With every drug having some types of side effects, the ones produced by taking this one include dizziness, drowsiness, headaches and nausea. While these might be more adaptable side effects that can be dealt with easily, a new study has revealed one side effect of the consumption of gabapentin that has more long-term effects than ever known before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case Western University in Cleveland performed a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-07-nerve-pain-drug-gabapentin-linked.html#google_vignette" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to find that gabapentin can significantly increase the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in people consuming it for lower chronic back pain. “Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence,” wrote the study authors in the study published in the journal Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does gabapentin really increase the risk of dementia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

These people were 85% more likely to be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment within 10 years of back pain diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dementia typically affects older adults over the age of 65, due to the consumption of gabapentin, the risk of dementia more than doubled among people between the ages of 35-49. Additionally, the risk of mild cognitive impairment more than tripled. Similar effects were seen in people between 50-64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the frequency of use was a deciding factor as well. Those with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment as compared to those who had 3-11 prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin was approved by the FDA in 1993 to control partial seizures in epilepsy patients older than 12. It was initially considered to have a low potential for abuse or dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, recently various cases of its side effects have been on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/yale-va-researchers-study-side-effects-of-gabapentin/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Pain Medicine highlighted how gabapentin exposure was associated with hospitalisation for all ages, even at low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study associating gabapentin with a higher risk of dementia support the monitoring of adult patients prescribed the drug to monitor their potential cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with drug consumption, other risks of dementia are traumatic brain injury, untreated hearing loss, depression, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and smoking.

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US Environmental Protection Agency has found no level of exposure to Pfos or Pfoa, two of the most common Pfas compounds, in drinking water is safe. They have a half-life in human blood of anywhere from two to five years, by most estimates. That means the body expels half the amount of the chemical that is in blood during that period. Depending on blood levels, it can take decades to fully expel Pfas naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though the findings represent the first time gut microbes have been found to remove Pfas, they have been found to alleviate the impacts of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/27/probiotics-plastics-fermented-food-bacteria-stomach-benefit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;, such as microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers didn’t set out to determine if the gut bacteria expelled Pfas specifically, but instead looked at a suite of 42 common food contaminants. No Pfas limits for food exist in the US, but there is broad consensus that it is among the main exposure routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some microbes performed well in expelling Pfas, so the study’s authors zoomed in on those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors introduced nine of a family of bacterial species into the guts of mice to humanize the mouse microbiome – the bacteria rapidly accumulated to absorb Pfas eaten by the mice, and the chemicals were then excreted in feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The bacteria seem to absorb the chemical, then use a “pump” mechanism that pushes toxins from the cells and aids in excretion, the authors wrote. The mechanism by which the chemicals are pulled into the cell is not yet understood, Lindell said, but she suspects there may be a similar pump. These are developed by microbes to expel other contaminants, drugs or antibiotics, Lindell added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The body more efficiently discharges short-chain Pfas through urine because the compounds are generally water-soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the most common and dangerous long chains are Pfoa and Pfna, which the microbes expelled at rates of up to 58% and 74%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lindell and other study leaders have started a company, Cambiotics, that will develop a probiotic based on their findings.

The truth is, everyday habits can significantly elevate cortisol levels, impacting our metabolism and overall health. Stress, in manageable doses, can propel us through life’s challenges. However, chronic stress—lasting weeks or months—takes a toll on our bodies, primarily through the hormone cortisol. This hormone, released during stressful moments, triggers the liver to release more glucose into the bloodstream for quick energy. In situations of immediate danger, this response is lifesaving. However, in the modern world, where stress often stems from deadlines or financial concerns, that energy frequently goes unused. As a result, blood sugar levels rise, and the body compensates by producing more insulin, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-1" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this may seem harmless, persistent insulin elevation can lead to insulin resistance. This condition not only raises the risk of type 2 diabetes but is also associated with weight gain, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Moreover, elevated cortisol levels encourage fat storage, particularly around the abdomen, known as visceral fat, which poses significant risks to cardiovascular health, as reported in the Archives of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-2" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifestations of chronic stress infiltrate our &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/5-healthy-morning-habits-for-physical-mental-and-spiritual-well-being/" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="daily habits,"&gt;daily habits,&lt;/a&gt; leading to erratic sleep patterns, heightened cravings for unhealthy foods, and skipped exercise routines. This creates a vicious cycle that perpetuates high cortisol levels and strains our metabolic system, according to the journal Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Vrinda Agrawal, a Consultant Endocrinologist at CARE Hospitals, highlights that managing stress is essential, not just for emotional well-being, but for efficient metabolic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 10 daily habits that may inadvertently raise cortisol and disrupt your metabolism:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistent sleep patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of regular sleep—even if you manage just seven hours a night—can spike cortisol levels and disrupt metabolic balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Physical inactivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to maintain an exercise routine? Skipping physical activity contributes to higher cortisol levels and the accumulation of abdominal fat, according to the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Excessive caffeine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming too much caffeine, particularly late in the day, can interfere with your sleep quality, thereby further heightening stress and cortisol levels, as reported in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-7" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Skipping meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irregular eating patterns can disrupt insulin levels and glycogen storage, negatively affecting &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/5-iodine-rich-foods-for-a-healthy-thyroid-metabolism-visual-story-11743416997441.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="metabolism,"&gt;metabolism,&lt;/a&gt; as reported in the Reproductive Toxicology Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-8" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Increased sugar and salt cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heightened cravings for sugary or salty foods can lead to unhealthy eating habits that keep blood sugar and cortisol levels high, according to Harvard Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Screen overload&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending excessive time on screens, whether at work or during leisure time, promotes a sedentary lifestyle and negatively impacts stress levels, potentially leading to metabolic issues, as reported in the Korean Journal of Family Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-10" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Lack of mindfulness practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglecting to incorporate moments of calm—such as deep breathing or meditation—can help prevent stress from accumulating in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Ignoring stress signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to recognise and address chronic stress can lead to persistent high cortisol levels, affecting your weight and energy levels, according to the International Journal of Preventive Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Neglecting routine health check-ups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to monitor your health can delay diagnoses of potential metabolic issues associated with high cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-13" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Poor dietary choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet high in processed foods and low in fibre can exacerbate metabolic dysfunction, leading to weight gain, as reported in Frontiers in Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-14" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter these effects, enabling consistent, health-oriented habits is crucial. Prioritise regular sleep, gentle daily physical activity, and mindful moments to help you decompress.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammation can increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nutritious diet, exercise and mindfulness may protect against inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy morning habits like yoga or a quiet cup of coffee or tea may help fight inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day on the right foot sets the tone for the rest of your day. So, why not begin by helping your body fight off inflammation? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We hear a lot about the negative effects of inflammation, but it can be helpful to know that not all inflammation is bad. Acute inflammation is a short-lived natural response our body has to injury or illness. That’s a good thing. Chronic inflammation, however, is prolonged and can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce our body’s ability to repair&lt;/a&gt; and heal, leading to increased risk of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, anything you can do to prevent it may keep you healthier in the long run. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These six inflammation-fighting morning habits can get you going.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-drink-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body loses fluids while you sleep, so in the morning, you naturally wake up a touch dehydrated. Starting your day with some water is a good choice for many reasons. Hydration is linked with longevity, reduced risk of chronic illness and general health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If those reasons aren’t enough to start your day with a cup of water, dehydration is tied to higher levels of inflammation in the body. Chronic dehydration may even lead to “inflammageing,” or chronic inflammation that happens as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, starting your day with a glass of water is free. So, this is one anti-inflammatory habit that should be easy to start if you’re not doing it already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-move-your-body-gently"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Move Your Body Gently  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your dog and cat are onto something when they take a big stretch as they roll out of bed in the morning. But getting some gentle morning movement shouldn’t be reserved just for our furry friends. Regular exercise helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your risk for chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As good for you as physical activity is, intense exercise can increase inflammatory markers in the short term. While exercise’s overall benefits outweigh any downsides, starting your day with some gentle movement may be especially beneficial if your goal is reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that moderate and lighter movement is not tied to the same increases in inflammatory markers in the body as intense exercise. That’s where stretching comes in. Its benefits go beyond just feeling good. Studies show that limbering up can help reduce inflammatory markers throughout your body, as well as locally in the tissues you are stretching.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that’s not the only way to gently move your body. A stroll around the block or an easy yoga session works, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-get-some-morning-light"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Get Some Morning Light  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that getting outside in the morning light can help you sleep better at night. That’s because a.m. sunshine helps regulate your body’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-afternoon-habit-to-start-for-better-sleep-11756992" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly influences your sleep-and-wake cycle. This, in turn, helps you wake up more easily in the morning and fall asleep at night. But your circadian rhythm isn’t just about sleep. It is also closely tied to your immune system and to inflammation. Conversely, lack of daylight may send your circadian rhythm into an inflammatory tailspin. One study found that shift workers with misaligned circadian rhythms had higher levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, getting some rays helps your body make vitamin D, which is known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Research has found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D’s ability to help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; may be particularly impactful in reducing the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-eat-some-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Eat Some Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The deep purples, vibrant reds and rich blues that color our favorite berries are indicators of just how loaded these tiny fruits are with antioxidants. In particular, berries are rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phenolic compounds&lt;/a&gt;, like anthocyanins and flavonols, which work to reduce inflammation in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are also delicious. When they’re in season, load up on colorful, fresh berries. When you can’t find fresh berries, frozen berries are just as good for you and often more affordable and convenient. Try them paired with protein-rich strained (Greek-style) yogurt or whir them into a smoothie for a tasty breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-make-time-for-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Make Time for Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is a sneaky trigger for inflammation. Why? When you’re stressed, your body goes into “fight or flight” mode, stimulating the release of stress hormones like cortisol. That may have been helpful back in the days when we had to be ready to outrun a saber-tooth tiger at a moment’s notice. Today, it’s still humming behind the scenes when that surprise 9 a.m. meeting suddenly drops on your calendar. Once in a while, that’s no big deal. Yet, being constantly stressed can also lead to inflammation in your brain and body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help keep stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress-related inflammation&lt;/a&gt; at bay, carve out a little time for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903638/science-backed-ways-to-be-happier-amp-reduce-stress-that-are-easy-and-free/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindfulness exercises&lt;/a&gt; like deep breathing or body scans, or try a morning meditation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-drink-coffee-or-tea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Drink Coffee or Tea  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning cup of joe or tea is more than just a nice, calming ritual that kicks off your day with a caffeine boost. Coffee and tea are jammed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation-busting antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. Take green tea, for example. It’s packed with antioxidants, like EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which research has found helps lower inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Black tea is also full of antioxidants shown to calm inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don’t turn your nose up at coffee, especially if that's your morning drink of choice. Coffee contains more polyphenols than green tea, plus other antioxidants that help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning is an ideal opportunity to get a jump start on fighting inflammation. But why stop there? These strategies can help you combat inflammation throughout the day and even at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;While this isn’t necessarily a morning habit, a good night’s sleep is crucial for reducing inflammation. Research has found that inconsistent sleep is tied with raised inflammatory markers, particularly for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Taking the time to wind down at night with a relaxing evening routine may help you get the zzz’s you need to fend off chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active Throughout the Day: &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your body, including fighting off chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, try to move your body regularly throughout the day. Stay moving by taking frequent walk breaks, having a kitchen dance party or getting more structured exercise at any time of day. A good goal is 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, plus two weekly strength-training sessions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;While there are plenty of anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet, there are also some foods to limit. Like added sugars, which have been linked to increased inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No need to stress if you have some sweets occasionally (remember, stress and inflammation go hand in hand). Just do your best to intentionally choose where you are getting sweetness in your diet. That means checking the ingredient list when buying foods like breads, crackers, yogurts and sauces to make sure they don’t contain too much added sugar. And when you do eat sweet foods, choose smaller portions of those that satisfy your sweet tooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

In a randomized clinical trial at Stanford University, researchers found that participants with heightened brain reactivity to unconscious threat cues showed marked changes in neural activity after receiving MDMA. These changes included reduced responses in brain regions associated with fear and improved connectivity between areas involved in emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDMA is a psychoactive compound best known as the recreational drug “ecstasy” or “molly,” but recent research has explored its use in treating mental health conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder. It has been shown to reduce defensiveness and enhance emotional openness, which may help people engage more effectively in therapy. While this approach shows promise, not everyone responds in the same way. The new study aimed to better understand the brain mechanisms involved in MDMA’s effects and to determine whether certain individuals might respond more strongly based on their brain activity before treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordpmhw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, focused on a specific brain circuit known as the “negative affect circuit,” which includes the amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. This network helps the brain detect and regulate responses to emotional threats, especially those outside of conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overactivity in this system is common in people with trauma histories and has been linked to poor treatment outcomes. The team hypothesized that MDMA might help normalize this circuit, but that the effect could depend on a person’s baseline level of activity in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were motivated by a central question: Who is most likely to benefit from MDMA-based treatment—and why? MDMA is emerging as a fast-acting treatment for PTSD and is currently seeking FDA approval as part of MDMA-assisted therapy,” said study authors &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/xue-zhang"&gt;Xue Zhang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/leanne-williams"&gt;Leanne Williams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams is the Vincent V.C. Woo Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, where she directs the Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness and the PanLab for Personalized and Translational Neuroscience. She also leads the Precision Medicine Core at the VA Palo Alto’s Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center and is the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3IoQRQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Precision Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Zhang is a research scientist in Williams’ lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While some individuals experience substantial benefits, others show little to no effect—suggesting that MDMA is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” the researchers said. “To understand this heterogeneity, we focused on the brain—specifically, how differences in neural circuit function might predict treatment response. PTSD is known to disrupt brain circuits involved in processing threat, including outside of conscious awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were particularly interested in whether individual variation in this ‘negative affect’ circuit might help identify who is more likely to benefit from MDMA. Our broader goal is to advance precision psychiatry based on personalized neuroscience: matching each person with the treatment most likely to work for them, based on their brain biotype.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 16 adults who had experienced early life trauma and were showing subclinical signs of posttraumatic stress. All participants had previously used MDMA but had not done so within the past six months. They did not meet the criteria for current psychiatric diagnoses. Each person completed four visits: one baseline session, one placebo session, and two sessions involving different doses of MDMA (80 and 120 milligrams), with the order randomized and spaced out over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During each visit, participants underwent functional MRI scans while completing a task designed to measure brain responses to nonconscious emotional threats. This involved briefly showing angry or fearful faces that were masked to prevent conscious recognition. The researchers also gathered behavioral data, such as how participants rated the likability of facial expressions and how quickly they responded to emotion recognition tasks. After each session, participants completed surveys about their emotional state and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before examining the effects of MDMA, the researchers divided participants into two groups based on how reactive their amygdala was to nonconscious threats at the baseline visit. Eight participants showed high activity in this region (the NTNA+ group), while the other eight showed lower activity (the NTNA− group). This split allowed the team to compare how these subgroups responded differently to MDMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants in the NTNA+ group received the higher MDMA dose, their brain activity showed notable changes. The amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate both became less active in response to threat cues. In addition, communication between these regions increased. These patterns suggest a shift toward a more balanced and regulated emotional response. In contrast, participants in the NTNA− group did not show the same neural changes after taking MDMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNA+ group also showed behavioral changes that aligned with the brain data. After taking 120 milligrams of MDMA, they rated angry faces as more likable, suggesting a softening of their automatic negative reactions. Interestingly, while their brain reactivity decreased, these participants reported greater anxiety and less desire to be with others during the MDMA session compared to the NTNA− group. Their written descriptions indicated more introspective and emotionally complex experiences. Meanwhile, the NTNA− group tended to report more pleasant and euphoric effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One striking finding was the consistency of brain circuit and behavioral findings within the negative affect biotype group,” Zhang and Williams told PsyPost. “Individuals with brain circuit hyperactivity also showed a stronger implicit threat bias, indicating that their brain activity disrupted their behavioral reaction time to respond to signals of threat that appeared outside of conscious awareness. This convergence between brain and behavior suggests that implicit behavioral responses might serve as surrogate markers of underlying brain biotypes—potentially allowing for stratification of individuals who are more likely to benefit from MDMA treatment using both behavior and brain-based measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that MDMA may work differently depending on how the brain processes emotional threats before treatment. For people with heightened baseline reactivity, MDMA appears to reduce brain responses linked to fear and increase connectivity in circuits involved in regulation. These effects could create a more open emotional state, potentially improving the effectiveness of therapy when combined with talk-based approaches. The study supports the idea that measuring brain activity could help match people with treatments tailored to their specific neural profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that how the brain responds to threat—especially at a nonconscious level—can shape how someone responds to MDMA,” Zhang and Williams explained. “This supports the idea that treatments should be personalized, not one-size-fits-all, and that each person’s brain biotype really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a neural circuit-based biotype with elevated baseline activity in the negative affect circuit—a brain circuit that includes the amygdala and is involved in automatically detecting and responding to threat. Individuals in this negative affect biotype with high threat reactivity showed significant changes after a single 120 mg dose of MDMA: reduced circuit hyperactivity, more adaptive connectivity, and improved behavioral responses to threat-related cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that this biotype may be especially suited for MDMA-based therapies,” Zhang and Williams said. “More broadly, it highlights how brain circuit function could serve as an objective marker for treatment matching—bringing us closer to precision psychiatry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to note that this was not a clinical trial of MDMA-assisted therapy. Instead, the study examined the effects of MDMA in a controlled setting without therapeutic guidance. While the results are promising, the small sample size and focus on healthy volunteers with subthreshold symptoms limit how broadly the findings can be applied. More research is needed in clinical populations, including people formally diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the focus of &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordpmhw.com/rbrain-mdma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;our current neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt;, led in collaboration with Dr. Trisha Suppes, and embedded in her clinical trial of MDMA-assisted cognitive processing therapy,” the researchers noted. “It will allow us to test whether the brain circuit biotypes we identified in our mechanistic trial can predict treatment response in real-world clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is part of a larger research effort funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to explore how fast-acting treatments like MDMA, ketamine, and psilocybin affect brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What set this MDMA study apart is that it’s the first to use a person’s pre-treatment brain circuit profile—what we call a biotype—to predict their acute response to the intervention,” Zhang and Williams said. “This circuit biotype-guided approach offers a promising way to improve future clinical trials and, ultimately, routine care. It could help stratify likely responders, rule out likely non-responders, minimize side effects, and streamline treatment – all key steps toward safer, more effective, and more accessible mental healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, the researchers hope to build tools that use brain scans to guide personalized treatment decisions. By identifying “biotypes” based on brain activity, clinicians could better determine which interventions are most likely to help specific individuals. This could reduce the burden of trial-and-error approaches that are common in mental health care today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to validate our circuit-based biotype in individuals with PTSD, and we’re actively doing that in our ongoing neuroimaging trial,” Zhang and Williams explained. “Longer term, we aim to accelerate the clinical translation of our tools that use brain imaging to help match each person with the treatment most likely works for them. We also plan to expand the matching of biotypes to additional treatments, and determine which treatments are specific to each biotype. This precision medicine approach could lead to more effective, personalized care—dramatically reducing the burden of trial-and-error treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.7803" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Negative Affect Circuit Subtypes and Neural, Behavioral, and Affective Responses to MDMA: A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was conducted by Xue Zhang, Laura M.

It puts healthy stress on the heart, which increases its capacity to function better and decreases resting blood pressure,” said &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, general and bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif. “Once you’re settled down from that increase, over time, your blood pressure improves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JOVCGDPANDZVB2P6HDMYB77ZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Masuki said that additional studies by her team have also shown that the walking technique has benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/20/sleep-banking-alertness-performance/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/31/exercise-walking-brain-health/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ND3YL27VAZFXPLH2DZXCIHIQ3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Mindful walking, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/nature-health-maps-neighborhood-city/" target="_blank"&gt;green space&lt;/a&gt;, has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce cortisol, improve focus and sleep, and help regulate mood,” said&lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.com/en/provider-profiles/walker-barbara-1225431273" target="_blank"&gt; Barbara Walker&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative health and performance psychologist at University of Cincinnati Health. “When paired with an interval walking approach, it becomes even more psychologically impactful: blending the benefits of nature exposure with the motivational structure of achievable physical goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BAIB6F33WBFQZGAB5SJOPJHTHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BAIB6F33WBFQZGAB5SJOPJHTHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How hard is interval walking training?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LIHELUZM7ZDI7OTBD5PZO4XT3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, the best workout is the one you’ll actually do.

Her research team instructed one group of their middle-aged and older subjects to walk continuously at the high intensity level for 30 minutes a day. “However, no one completed the program, and they complained that the program was too boring and too difficult,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6Z23QRH2RFGVPOD3SM3C3CDAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most studies have found about 60 to 90 percent of people can achieve the goals of IWT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QRECCNHPOJDLXFSXYN3SDG5PSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One factor might be the amount of time it takes.

You don’t have to jump into 30-minute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/02/fartlek-interval-training-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;interval sessions&lt;/a&gt; right away. Ali said even 15 minutes twice per day is still beneficial, and you can still try those intervals within that. Work up to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended amount of exercise&lt;/a&gt; for adults in the U.S. — 150 minutes of physical activity each week, for example, by doing 30 minutes at a time, 5 days per week. Adding in two days of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/29/minimum-weight-training-per-week/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-strengthening activity &lt;/a&gt;would help meet the federal guidelines for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KGFTGKTHFA63GY5B2VBLIS77Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As always, talk to your doctor before beginning any new exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CA4FS5PVZJBMROCSB7LO33Y6WM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We shouldn’t take a previously sedentary person and put them in a high-intensity interval training program,” said &lt;a href="https://anchorcincy.com/anchor-our-team/sarah-crawford/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist in Cincinnati. “That’s why practices like mine stay in business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Use unofficial metrics&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI5LXIIU7NG55FRV75VUKIP3GA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the 2007 study, the volunteers aimed to do three minutes of walking at 70% of their peak aerobic capacity or VO2 max, which is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen the body can process, followed by three minutes at 40% of their peak aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3N6GNKO2AZCYFEBKNSIX6G6EDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While some fitness trackers will give you this number, a good rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t really be able to talk for the whole three “fast” minutes in IWT, Crawford said. For the slower interval, she said you should be able to maintain a conversation, but also keep a sweat going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GFBDU7YKFDJ3KTF4UJTGTADG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She sometimes recommends patients choose a landmark, like mailboxes, and walk past the first 10 quickly, then the next 10 more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KAIWS6D5LBATZPNNVRMMASQ2AE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KAIWS6D5LBATZPNNVRMMASQ2AE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Watch for improvements&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZQUOO3UTY5CHDE2XWRGL2RBIXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your heart rate and breathing recovery may improve over time, Crawford said. Pay attention to when you recover enough to do another quick interval, she said. “How long do we stay there [at 70 percent], and how long does it take at the 40 percent threshold to recover enough to go back up into that 70 percent again?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BPRAZTTYJFCDBHPDXCTMPQUBIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Regardless of the type of walking you try, you’re bound to see benefits, said Crawford: “Walking is safe, low impact, easily accessible, getting somebody out in Earth and off a computer, in feedback with trees and plants and animals,” she said. “It has sun exposure, light exposure, and sensory overdrive of being outside. It is, hands down 100 percent the best form of exercise for all human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:16:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOMV9wbjNzNUlqWnd2dTlRTDNNekpSRUVQdXRmWVRlR3FhNTFNem9NY0VwMDRzQWwwOEUyNHQ2WW1WbWVBUnhrOTdBWXQyRDJBTmFDakoycFRLQVNiMGd0WGxqMllOQmVjUnRvN0FmS3JraXFfSzItMUZVZHFRckFGU2N3UjlESXdmZjBySkIzdUpLWjlkWWkyLXJ3</guid></item><item><title>为什么纽约的母亲有这么多剖腹产？ -时代联盟 | Why are mothers in New York having so many C-sections? - Times Union</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdWVmSkF0Y0FVNWE5eEFCWU91cjZ4UTV5UnFVWXpkeTJGZ0ZSbW9WdVNSVjdZMGwxcUZvSDRJcmJ0eExtMEZjRFRqTmdoUWhPOVdMVVhRdFVlalFMLUtxaWhqU3VwSlF0U21VTXlrbmFxRUZjc2kzSzlZU1RtdVkyUXc4ZkVWdmhOMEpIUk43a1Vkb2tScGhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How can we lower our cortisol levels through diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution to lowering cortisol is to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/stress-busting-techniques/"&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt;. For busy mid-lifers who don’t have the time to practice breathwork or meditation, a cortisol diet might be the best way to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is closely linked with our gut health, and studies have shown that having high levels of good gut bacteria can help regulate cortisol levels. Similarly, an unhealthy gut can drive up cortisol and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-guide/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, says Ludlam-Raine. So it’s important to have a healthy gut to keep your cortisol levels stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood sugar regulation is also extremely important,” Ludlam-Raine adds.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Spikes and crashes from high-sugar or ultra-processed diets can increase cortisol as your body tries to stabilise energy levels.” Zoe Jane Hindle, a functional wellness practitioner, says: “In the morning, you need to make sure you’re eating a proper meal – having just a pastry is not enough. When your blood sugars go up, you will crash because you’re on a blood sugar roller-coaster without even realising it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about tweaking your diet to lower your cortisol levels make sure you avoid things like “bulletproof &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/over-60s-four-coffees-a-day/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;” which is often peddled as being a way to reduce it. The drink mixes coffee with grass-fed butter or ghee and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and promises boost energy levels and improve focus. However, it may cause more harm than good because of caffeine which can increase cortisol production. Eating a lot of saturated fats (found in butter and ghee) can also increase cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other fad worth swerving is Ashwagandha, an African plant which is popular in the wellness community for boosting calm and lowering stress levels. As promising as it may appear, those considering taking Ashwagandha should do their research beforehand – it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it doesn’t always make things better. It also may interfere with certain medications such as blood-pressure lowering medications, and ones that treat diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritise whole, minimally processed foods, eat regularly to avoid blood sugar dips and stay hydrated, says Ludlam-Raine. A balanced plate that includes fibre, healthy fats, protein, and complex carbs helps keep blood sugar stable and supports your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Nine foods to lower your cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Ludlam-Raine shares her top nine foods to help lower your cortisol levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Yoghurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A serving (150g) of plain, natural yoghurt with live cultures acts as a probiotic, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39458560/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that some probiotics may reduce cortisol levels. This can be the result of probiotics helping to reduce gut inflammation and, in turn, lower cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts contain omega-3 fatty acids as well as fibre and unsaturated fats, which support inflammation and brain health. One &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01077-2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that regularly consuming omega-3 does reduce overall cortisol. A handful of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-of-walnuts/"&gt;walnuts&lt;/a&gt; (or 28g) is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Olive oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil has more &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27443526/"&gt;evidence &lt;/a&gt;of managing stress than &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8020963/"&gt;regular olive oil&lt;/a&gt; – it’s higher in unsaturated fats and antioxidants which help lower inflammation and therefore stress. You need to make sure that you’re using extra virgin olive oil&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;every time you cook and aim for one to two tablespoons per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Tinned mackerel or sardines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be aiming for two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oily fish.

Americans were moving more than ever pre-COVID — and then the world shut down.

Drink your coffee while on a morning walk, or take a lap around the office (or your home!) in between meetings. You can also make socializing time more active: Instead of meeting a friend for dinner or drinks, consider a workout class or evening stroll.

These small, fuzzy fruits pack a big punch. Not only are they loaded with vitamin C, but just one kiwi contains 2 to 4 grams of fiber, something most Americans &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/fibermaxxing-dietitian-approved-heres-more-090046055.html" data-ylk="slk:aren’t getting enough of in their diets;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;aren’t getting enough of in their diets&lt;/a&gt;. And kiwis also contain actinidin, an enzyme that helps break down protein and therefore aids in digestion. So if you’re feeling a little backed up (ahem), or just want a refreshing summer snack you can feel good about, kiwis are a great go-to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/battery" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🔋;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🔋&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Skip that energy drink in the afternoon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the afternoon sleepies set in, it can be tempting to reach for something highly caffeinated — like an energy drink — to help you stay alert. But think twice, cardiologist Dr. Bhavna Suri tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/one-thing-never-ever-hour-175000247.html" data-ylk="slk:Parade;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; this week. “Drinking these substances in excess sometimes speeds up our heart rate too much, or can cause some extra heartbeats, called ectopy,” Suri explains, resulting in palpitations. Another downside? Drinking caffeine later in the day can interrupt our sleep, which can lead to heart issues down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So what can you do about that post-lunch energy slump? Suri recommends taking a 15-minute walk — and getting some fresh air — to feel more refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/grey-heart" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩶;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🩶&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Don’t wear heather gray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s hot out there! You’re probably sweating a lot this summer — but that doesn’t mean you want everyone to know. Stylist Sophie Strauss has this top tip for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/natural-fibers-no-heathered-grey-140037389.html" data-ylk="slk:the Guardian;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: Avoid wearing heather gray, which has black undertones that make it appear much darker when wet (and making those pit stains way more obvious). Navy and dark green tops are more forgiving, she adds, while busy patterns can offer a nice distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/lime" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍋‍🟩;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍋‍🟩&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Avoid 'margarita burn'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Making margaritas for a summer party? Beware so-called margarita burn. Our friends at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/dermatology/articles/margarita-burn-dermatologist-warns-common-163632899.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; say that the lime juice in margs contains &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/furanocoumarin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:furanocoumarin;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;furanocoumarin&lt;/a&gt;, which can react with sunlight and cause a type of skin inflammation known as phytophotodermatitis. This type of rash, which can show up hours after you touch lime juice, may leave behind red marks that fade into brown patches and can take up to eight weeks to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still want to squeeze some limes for a fresh batch of margaritas? Make sure to rinse your hands immediately after juicing. Dermatologist Dr. David Kim tells &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; that if you’re already feeling the burn, use a steroid cream followed by brightening serums with kojic acid and arbutin, which can prevent brown patches from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/hamburger" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍔;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍔&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stop ruining your workout with this nutrition mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/articles/6-common-nutrition-habits-sports-162639317.html" data-ylk="slk:Self;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;, you might be sabotaging your workout gains with poor nutritional habits — like waiting too long to eat after you exercise. Unfortunately, doing so can delay muscle repair and increase soreness, leaving you feeling wiped out, dietitian Alex Larson explains. If you’re not eating a meal after your workout, go for a snack that combines carbs and protein. A glass of chocolate milk and a turkey sandwich are solid options — or, make a fruit smoothie with a scoop of protein powder or some Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/potted-plant" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🪴;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🪴&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Forego fake plants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interior designer Bri Macdonald tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/home-garden/home-decor/articles/im-interior-designer-works-wealthy-135801536.html" data-ylk="slk:Business Insider;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; that one thing that cheapens the look of a home is low-quality fake plants — but it’s not just aesthetics you should be concerned about.

And since cheese tends to be higher in salt, it’s often on the chopping block for folks looking to eat healthier. If you’re a cheese fan, though, you don’t have to cut it out entirely. Instead, experts for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/1-dairy-product-help-lower-190000841.html" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt; recommend avoiding higher sodium cheeses and opting instead for Swiss cheese, which is less salty than other varieties. For example, a one-ounce serving of Swiss cheese contains about 52 mg of sodium, while cheddar has about 185 mg. Plus, Swiss is rich in bioactive peptides, which may actually benefit blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-lifting-weights" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🏋️;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🏋️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Work out this body part daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Want to sneak in a daily workout that’s actually safe? Your core is the one body part you can work out every day, no rest days needed, trainer Stephanie Mansour tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/trainer-reveals-1-body-part-114936514.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:25;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because your core muscles — think abs, lower back, hips and pelvis — are smaller, they recover faster than larger muscle groups like your quads or biceps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Plus, building a strong core improves posture, reduces back pain, helps with balance and makes everyday movements easier. Start with a five-minute routine of exercises like planks, crunches and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/mountain-climbers-way-faster-doesn-155218491.html" data-ylk="slk:mountain climbers;cpos:26;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;mountain climbers&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A traditionally overlooked type of RNA plays an important role in promoting resilience to depression—but only in females. According to a new study led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, researchers have now discovered a novel role this molecule plays in how the female brain makes decisions. The authors revealed brain-region-specific and sex-dependent effects of this biomarker, translated from humans to animals, on how individuals make only certain types of choices. This study uncovered differences in how each sex decides whether to change their minds after making mistakes, including when to cut their losses and move on as well as how they process regrets about missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This research sheds important light on how specific types of decisions that could negatively impact mood engage the male and female brain in very different ways. The study, published July 11 in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances,&lt;/i&gt; using laboratory animal models, helps uncover new biological and psychological mechanisms that may be linked to psychiatric vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are twice as likely to develop depression than men. Furthermore, depression can manifest with different symptoms between the sexes, including alterations in negative rumination on the past. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our motivation for this work stemmed from a major gap in understanding why depression is more prevalent in females and how symptoms related to negative rumination take shape in the brain," said Brian Sweis, MD, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, and Neuroscience, at the Icahn School of Medicine and senior author of the paper. "We set out to investigate how the brain at risk for developing depression thinks about one's prior choices and how neural circuits that process such computations could contribute to disease burden in this way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study builds on a recent breakthrough involving a traditionally overlooked class of molecules known as non-coding RNA that were found to play a pivotal role in depression pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 study that leveraged analyses of postmortem human brain tissue, researchers also involved in the current study (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32304628/" target="_blank"&gt;Issler et al.&lt;/a&gt;) discovered that expression levels of the long intergenic non-coding RNA termed LINC00473 were reduced, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, in the brains of women—but not men—diagnosed with major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Orna Issler, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Neuroscience, and Anesthesiology, at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, lead author of that 2020 study, and co-author of the present study, said, "We translated these findings into an animal laboratory model and demonstrated a causal role of prefrontal LINC00473, when experimentally increased, in promoting resilience to stress in female mice only."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex is a key brain region essential for integrating mood with decision-making. In a key finding of the present study, researchers demonstrated that by surgically manipulating LINC00473 in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; in mice, they could enhance how females, but not males, changed their minds while foraging for rewards. By applying principles of neuroeconomics to their analyses, the authors discovered that increased LINC00473 levels drove behavioral differences in females by enhancing sensitivity to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar8644" target="_blank"&gt;sunk costs&lt;/a&gt; [overvaluing lost investments] and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add5579" target="_blank"&gt;regret&lt;/a&gt; [sensitivity to missed opportunities] related to change-of-mind decisions—traits that may be associated with resilience to stress. Importantly, this is the first study to show that non-coding RNA plays a functional role in cognition in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were able to selectively alter decision-making behavior involved in re-evaluating a recently selected choice without altering the initial judgment itself," said Romain Durand-de Cuttoli, Ph.D., Instructor in Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of this study. "Choices that depend on reflecting on the past are neurobiologically distinguishable from those that involve planning for the future. These are fundamentally distinct types of decisions processed in separate circuits in the brain, differently in males and females, that could in turn affect emotions in unique and complex ways."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The implications of this research are significant. The study points to a novel molecular target for new drug development as well as an anatomical target for brain stimulation therapeutics that could potentially treat depressive symptoms related to negative rumination, specifically for females. Furthermore, the study sheds light on psychological aspects of resilience vs. vulnerabilities to depression in females. This work offers new insights for establishing a mechanistic link between the neurobiology of stress responses and how affective states interact with our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research helps us appreciate that sensitivity to regret may not always be a bad thing. There are many 'flavors' of regret that could come from different parts of the brain and that can manifest very differently in males and females. Ruminating on the past, while potentially unpleasant, can still be useful for learning and can contribute to how we process emotions, deal with stress, and grow from past experiences," explained Dr. Sweis. "The challenge will be to disentangle what aspects of this are maladaptive and feed into worsening depressive symptoms and which are healthy, adaptive, and part of an intact coping strategy. It is also exciting that behavioral findings from an animal study can push us to ask new questions about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+psychology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human psychology&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could directly inform advances in psychotherapy tailored to the individual. This study is a step in the right direction toward these goals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This work emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of multiple fields, including psychiatry, psychology, and neuroscience," said Eric J. Nestler, MD, Ph.D., Interim Dean, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Chief Scientific Officer, Mount Sinai Health System; senior author of the Issler et al., 2020 study; and co-author of the present study. "Translational cross-species research that includes leveraging animal models is crucial for making unexpected discoveries and accelerating the development of richer diagnostics, innovative treatments, and improved outcomes for those struggling with mental illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;
